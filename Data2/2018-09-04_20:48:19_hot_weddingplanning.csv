We said from the beginning that the most important thing to us was to throw an awesome party. So we focused our money on making sure people would be fed and plied with drinks, that the music would be great, and that we had a venue that would provide a good setting for a party.

I had no bouquet (and thus no bouquet toss). No flowers anywhere at the ceremony site or in the reception venue. We let his mom handle table decorations, which were pretty simple (but pretty!). We had no guest book, and did almost no DIY (basically just favors and name cards) and let the existing venue decorations dominate the setting. We didn't have any reception games (despite this being something heavily expected by his side of the family, as for them weddings are about the entertainment). 

And the end result was that we had a fucking blast, and so many of our friends and family did, too. The reception went from 6 pm to 2 am and it wasn't dull for a single second. In the days since our wedding on Saturday, my favorite thing has been hearing stories about who everyone talked to and what previously non-existant connections were made between people from different parts of our lives (like my parents finally getting to meet my husband's incredible friend circle or my US-based friends finally getting to meet my German-based friends). Our goal for this wedding was to surround ourselves with the people who loved us and whom we loved back, and give them a night to finally meet each other and socialize with us over food, drinks and music. And we achieved this goal a thousand times over.

I'll post a more thorough recap somewhere down the line, but for now, I just want to let those of you who are feeling similarly to how I was: if you don't want to care about things like flowers or centerpieces or making the perfect guest book, or anything else - you don't have to. I skipped so much, and I don't regret a single thing.

I know I might get some flack for this but I have to let it out to someone besides FH and my sister. TL;DR at the bottom.

&#x200B;

For reference we are all late 20's - early/mid 30's aged.

&#x200B;

On Saturday my sister (MOH) threw us a bridal shower. Since neither I nor FH have a ton of female family in the area, we decided to do a co-ed couples shower instead. My sister (and entire family) did an amazing job, everything was so well planned and looked amazing, there was SO much food, it was nice for our families to finally meet our friends and vice versa. I'm so incredibly thankful for everything our families did and have done, we totally felt their support and they were our rock the whole day.

&#x200B;

Our friends, not so much. 

&#x200B;

My sister asked different bridesmaids and groomsmen to bring different things, instead of having everyone chip in monetarily or split the cost of the party. She (IMO) very much undershot what she could have asked people to bring, and instead opted to make it easier on them by having them bring smaller (but still important) items. A card game we all love from one bridesmaid, two bouquets of simple grocery store flowers from another, a case of beer from each of the guys, small amounts of ice. 

&#x200B;

The best man, my FH's best friend in the whole world for almost 10 years, brought a medium-sized (like an 18 pack) case of the absolute cheapest beer you can buy. When we play beer pong we don't even use this beer - I had never drank it before, I never thought it was even on any of our friends' radar. And no we aren't talking Coors or PBR, think Naty Ice or Steele Reserve. He was the first of the groomsmen to arrive so for a while we only had that beer (plus wine and other drinks) for a while, and I was so embarrassed offering those to our other guests as they arrived. 

This happened quite a few times:

""Hey bridalshowersadness, is there beer?""

""Yes! It's in the cooler on the patio!""

""Oh, the \[cheap beer that most of us have never drank before in our lives\]?""  
""Yeah I think that's all there is at the moment, sorry!""

No one said anything about it of course, and I'm thankful that he did help us out by bringing drinks, it's just hard for it not to feel.... passive aggressive? Why now, of all times, bring this worst brand of beer, when he knew that he was going to be meeting some of our family for the first time, he knew this was our once-in-a-lifetime bridal shower not just a random summer potluck, and he had heard how much effort my sis was putting into this? He's brought over larger amounts of better beer for a regular old movie night. He makes good money and has a lot of disposable income so it's not a money issue. And like I said, I wasn't expecting him to bring a keg of the highest percentage craft IPA - even the same amount (although I don't get why you wouldn't bring a 36 pack if you're bringing the cheapest beer....) of Miller Highlife or Budweiser would have been totally fine. 

&#x200B;

There were also TEN no-shows, of people that had been saying how excited they were to go up until a few days before. One friend even messaged me on instagram last Thursday to confirm this was a shower and not just a party. Then he just doesn't show up. So he checked to make sure this is an important life event and not just a Labor Day BBQ, and he still flaked. 

&#x200B;

The worst part, and this is the brattiest part that I feel the worst about being upset over, is that we received three gifts out of almost 30 guests, and one of them was from my mom. Literally none of our bridal party brought a gift or card. I expected a few people to show up without, as a few are more immature for their age, but almost everyone? Numerous of the guests are married, have been married, or have thrown bridal showers themselves. We've given bridal and baby shower gifts for many of them within the past few years. They should have known - they MUST have known? Our registry info was on the invitation, clear as day. We have gifts as low as $3 on our registry. A signed card with no other gift inside would have been great!

&#x200B;

My mom and FMIL really wanted us to open gifts in front of everyone like a traditional shower, and now I'm so, so glad we didn't set time aside from that. That would have been humiliating. 

&#x200B;

I totally understand if you don't believe me, but I swear I am NOT a materialistic person AT ALL. Sure I was excited at the thought of getting new things for our home, but the party itself IS what I was excited for. I actually had an amazing time at the party and wasn't upset at all until after everyone left; my sister told us to open our presents and relax, and there were only three sitting there. Even then I was like ""oh, weird"" and it wasn't until we were driving home that it hit me how little I felt cared for. Sure, the people who love us most showed up for us, celebrated with us, ate and drank. That is nice, it makes my heart happy. But it just feels like we aren't deserving of the same effort and courtesy that other people receive. Like we're more than good enough to plan parties for other people, and give them thoughtful gifts, and be there to listen to all of their problems, and help them move and give them rides. But we aren't good enough to have those people throw us a semi-traditional event before a huge milestone in our lives. 

&#x200B;

These are people we've known for years and years. If it wasn't a BBQ with alcohol, but a more standard ""stuffy"" bridal shower, I wonder if any of them would have even come at all. It's the lack of effort that hurts, not the amount of physical things we can hold. I feel like everyone was excited at the thought of me throwing a party (I used to throw huge, fun themed parties before we moved into a smaller place) and didn't even think about the reason FOR the party.

&#x200B;

Thank you for letting me vent you guys. I really do know that gifts are optional and not a requirement, etc etc etc. I swear I do. I just feel so weird because I can't even vent to my best friends and bridal party about this, so I'm very thankful to have this community. Hopefully you can understand the odd feeling of being so appreciative and so hurt at the same time. It's confusing and shocking and I feel so stupid for even making a registry or for getting so excited for the party. Which then makes me feel terrible cause my sis and family did such a great job. I'll get over this in a few days, but for now it still stings. 

&#x200B;

For the people who were no shows: I'm thinking about calming down a bit more, and then revisiting the wedding guest list in a few weeks. These are people we considered close friends, who all found something better to do this weekend (and no, none of them had emergencies or anything that came up. They posted on instagram while they drank at local restaurants during the shower.) Thoughts?

&#x200B;

TL;DR: We received almost no gifts at our shower and we feel unloved by our guests' lack of effort. Now I'm feeling confused, hurt and embarrassed, and unsure where to go from here.

I had met the bride once at a party, never met the groom. My FH went to high school with both, and was good friends with the bride for years. So when she messaged me asking for our address, I was really excited! A few weeks pass and we recieved a STD addressed only to our roomates, A & D, who are also friends with the bride (neither have met the groom either). So we were confused, as the bride specifically reached out to me for our address. We waited for the invited to see what the final decision was. Our roommates again recieved formal invites, and we did not get anything. Three weeks later we get an invite for ""drinks and dancing"" after the reception. So our feelings were hurt because we understood we were the B list. I understand that the bride was in a hard position because we have roommates she wanted to invite too. But I think it would have been more appropriate to reach out to the other couple instead of me for the address. In the end, with bride approval, I went with my roommate A to the ceremony & reception, and my FH and D joined us after for drinks and dancing (they had a prior commiment). 

&#x200B;

Overall, it was a cute wedding. The couple looked very happy, their love was obvious! So more of a breakdown: 

**Ceremony:**

* It was at a casino, so we had to drive a bit to find a parking spot. We also weren't sure what door would be the best to enter so we just guessed and then followed signs once we were inside. 
* Once we found the correct event room, we had no idea what to do. Bridal part were walking in and out, some people were sitting inside, some outside the room. We decided to go get a drink to kill time. Once we got back we talked with a few other friends outside the room. There was a miscommunication as to if drinks were allowed in or not. We were told to finish ours before entering. Yet once we went in, about half the people in there had drinks. Very confusing. 
* The room was a standard event center room. They put up curtains behind them in their bridal colors and some string lights. 
* Chairs were comfortable and spaced well. Didn't feel cramped or too close to the person next to me. 
* The music didn't have the fade out, so noticeable silence as we waited and during the processional. 
* Ceremony was sweet. A lot of puns/metaphors which the couple seemed to enjoy. They had a sand unity ceremony. The vows were the repeat after me, but sounded like they still incorperated their own ideas into. It didn't sound like ones I've heard before. 
* Recieving line was right at the end of the aisle. Ushers dismissed by rows. It look a while because it was a large wedding. Bride told us later that 240 invited. 

**Reception:** 

* After the recieving line, we were ushered into the connected room where the reception was. 
* We didn't know if, or how long, the cocktail hour was. There was no seating chart/table assignments. No signs for what was available at the bar, or cost. Literally no signs. Please have something, as 240 is a large group of people who need directions. Maybe a smaller wedding could have done without. Or have someone announce information. 
* Buffet dinner was good, normal spread of chicken, prime rib, potatoes, salad, and bread rolls. The prime rib had a sauce next to it that didn't have a sign, people were guessing if it was anything from gravy to pudding. Turns out it was a horseraddish sauce. Please have a sign. 
   * Another hiccup - the person responsible for releasing tables for the buffet was late. And then she released us in a strange order. Our table was skipped/missed. We flagged down another worker and he said we should just get in line. Half of our table did, half stayed. The other half tired to join the line a few minutes later and the table-release woman yelled at them to sit back down until released. Once she was far enough away (on the other side of the dance floor) they got up and got in line. We felt bad but every table within 3 rows already had food. We were starving and buzzed. 
* Speeches were lovely, heartfelt, and hilarious. MOH and best man were only bridal party members who gave speeches. MOG and FOB gave quick 30 second thank you speeches. 
* Dances were next - a little delay as the bridal party scattered after speeches. Took a few mins to round them all up again. Dances were cute, the couple sang the song to each other. They laughed and it was very sweet! Father/daughter dance was to the impeial march, it was so cool! 
* They did the dollar dance and then opened up the dance floor for everyone. 
* They did the garter belt, bouquet toss, and something I had never seen before: a literal ball and chain attached to the groom and they auctioned off the key. I don't know if that is a thing, I've never seen it. Maybe a family tradition? 

**Overall:** The wedding was sweet, and you could really tell how excited the bride and groom were to marry each other. My biggest issue was the lack of communication - we didn't know what, where, when anything was. "

My brother got married recently and I was sooooo happy for him. I'm getting married soon and it's honestly been really fun getting to know his fiance better and being able to bounce ideas off someone. She's wonderful :) So, this isn't about that.

They are the type of couple that are attached at the hip, always together, always having fun. The hashtag was created for them. My fiance and I are are much more independent. We trust and support each other 100% and we give each other a lot of freedom when it comes to event obligations. (You don't want to go to my cousins party? that's cool, I don't really want to go to your uncles housewarming.)

Anyway, my brother and his fiance just looked SO IN LOVE. Also because they are always together the families are super close. My parents and her parents have become friends. It's just so nice. And you could just feel it in the room. And the wedding was PERFECT.

I just felt myself getting kinda jealous. And a little freaked out that I'm not going to be able to help comparing their wedding to ours. Just need some reassurance on the day of none of this will matter :)"

The deadline to RSVP was Aug 15. On Sunday, they RSVP'd for their young child to attend as well. The invite was addressed to the couple only (Mr. & Mrs. X). We did online RSVPs and I guess I should have disabled that option after the deadline, but it didn't occur to me that anyone would try to do this (I guess lesson learned for anyone reading this). I only noticed it today when I checked my email and saw the reservation notification.

The only children we invited to our wedding are my brother's, because he and his wife are traveling from out of town and have two very young children they don't want to leave behind. (This couple lives in the same town as the wedding, if it matters.) No other guests are bringing children. It will not be a particularly child-friendly event (lots of alcohol and lots of wild dancing is the vibe we're going for). 

I've known this couple for a very long time and they are wonderful people. I'm so shocked that they would do something so rude (or not know that what they did is rude?) and I'm now really upset that I'm going to have to make a super awkward phone call to tell them that their child can't come. I'm worried that this could damage my relationship with these people, but I did not budget or plan for their child to attend. On the other hand, I feel like maybe I'm over-reacting due to wedding stress, because I'm so upset by this and maybe I shouldn't be. 

Am I over-reacting? Has anyone had to handle a similar situation? How did it go? "

But FH and I are both pretty turned off by the standard kitschy photo booth props. They feel played out and those kinds of pictures aren't really our thing. We could maybe come up with a few fun props that suit our wedding vibes (like flower crowns or giant paper flowers since the wedding is at a wildflower center, maybe some paper cutouts of our cats) but we really don't want the usual over-sized glasses, costume hats, and feather boas.

Typed during my break on my phone & my anxiety might have made me ramble a bit. 

I am having trouble incorporating my traditional/cultural ceremony aspects into our wedding. I‚Äôm Bosnian, and my FH is American. Our wedding is going to be pretty standard to an American wedding, in the sense that I will be walking down the aisle, my dad will give me away, and the ceremony will be at our venue not in a mosque (unlike a traditional Bosnian wedding). Neither of us are religious and have already decided to have a friend officiate and keep things neutral there. The issue is, I have no idea how to make a few traditions happen in the way I want it to, and was wondering if anyone else is in a similar situation.
 
We have lived together for 2+ years, and are not doing a registry, or even asking/expecting gifts. This first situation is more so not wanting guests to feel uniformed or like they are not doing something right. In traditional Bosnian weddings, the couple is gifted cash during different times of the event rather than a full amount in a card or something. One tradition is 2 cousins are going to walk around pre-ceremony and pin small boutonnieres on each guest. It is a way to make each guest feel like an important part of the celebration. One holds a basket of the boutonnieres, and one holds and empty basket. As one pins the boutonniere, it is expected that the guest put a small amount of cash in the other basket. There are many other moments like this in a Bosnian wedding, but this is the only one we are doing/makes sense with our actual wedding. My Bosnian wedding guests will know this, but I don‚Äôt want my other guests to see this and feel awkward/obligated, but I also don‚Äôt want them to feel like they missed out on a tradition because they didn‚Äôt know.
 
The next is music: Music is SUPER important to my side of the family (Bosnian music). My FH suggested having an American DJ, and a Bosnian musician/singer alternate during the reception. Has anyone ever done this before? I worry about the logistics of things a lot. Also, there is a traditional Bosnian dance that I would love my guests (who are comfortable) participate in. How can I inform my guests of the music/dancing situation beforehand? 

Do I even need to? I really want my friends to get a feel for my culture and traditions without making it too confusing.

My fiance and I love board and card games, and so do a lot of our friends. We thought it would be awesome to have some board game tables set up during our reception. Has anyone done this at their wedding, and how did you go about this? My main concern is losing or having damaged pieces/cards, which would be awful! Some specific games we own include Dominion, Mahjong, Betrayal at Baldur's Gate, Coup, Bang, Once Upon a Time, none of which are inexpensive or have easily replaceable pieces/cards.

We'll probably have about 70 guests (no kids), and will be in an indoor space for the reception. If we do this, I plan to have a sign by the games asking people not to have food or drink while using the games, and to please be careful to not lose or damage parts, but accidents do happen. Any ideas on how to implement this while ensuring the ""safety"" of our board games? Are there board game rental services that I don't know about?

I have a solid relationship with my dad. He's not perfect, neither am I, but we love each other and have a good connection. I feel like when I was a little girl and imagined that moment it would be with my dad walking me down. As I grew older and had friends whose fathers passed away, them missing out on that moment always came up in discussion.  


However, as I grow into my own person, learning about the unpleasant histories of marriage and how the father was basically handing off property to this other man.. As well as just generally being very independent...  Walking down alone feels more appropriate for me.  


But it would be nice to thank my dad in this way... but what about my mom? How is that fair? I know he'd support whatever I decided and would be perfectly content to not have to parade himself in front of damn near 200 people... But am I going to regret not sharing that moment with him.... GAH!"

I contacted a wedding planner and was told that once I decide on the location & resort, guests will have 30 days to put a deposit down to guarantee their travel rates and it sounds like to also ensure we have 10 rooms (btw I‚Äôm not sure what the consequences would be if we don‚Äôt have 10 rooms confirmed in advance).

1. 30 days just seems like a really quick window and doesn‚Äôt leave time for formal invitations - is this normal, do most people just send email invites for destination weddings?

2. It feels like a pretty big expectation to put on people to commit to coming to a wedding 9 months away and to firmly do so with a deposit in a 30 day window.

My super amazing fiance is from Italy.  We live in the UK.  There is literally no way for us to not have a wedding that's a destination wedding for some guests.

First, some gushing.

We both want something small and casual and he's dreamed of getting married at the lovely old stone farmhouse where he grew up in the hills of Tuscany.  Amazing, I'm 100% down.  He wants it to be at the end of June when the cherry trees are fruiting and the hills are covered in wildflowers.  We'll pick flowers and small cherry branches to decorate the tables (his ideas, fiance of the year award to him). Since he is technically the owner of that house, it looks like we may be able to have the ceremony in this ridiculously beautiful castle for free.  Just WHAT.

https://i.redd.it/c1bcqsva28k11.jpg

He told me that he wanted his family friend who works in the local village to cater the wedding. The friend agreed, saying that my fiance is basically family.  Yes!  Local, casual, lovely.  But turns out he's weirdly famous.  Catered for royalty and rockstars.  Yet this doesn't feel like it lost the feel that we wanted; it's still intimate, personal, and sweetly romantic.  I don't even understand how this is my life.

‚Äã

But now groaning:

40 people, 20 for each of us, is small.  It's what we want, but the moment people hear ""Tuscany"" they say, ""Oh that sounds great!  When is it so I can start planning my trip?""  People assuming that they're invited to a wedding is pretty frustrating, but it's especially hard since I want them all there, but space and finances say otherwise.  And then there's the politics.  I can't invite really close friend A without friends B and C feeling left out, and they need plus ones so if I invite friend A, that is now 30% of my invites gone.  I have one aunt and uncle who have done the world for me and the rest, not so much.  But can't invite one set without the others.

How did others with small weddings deal with choosing people to come with all of these political issues?  Did you leave out key people just to have consistent rules?"

How do you deal with bridal party?,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb6b2ff60>,khburzon,0,5,2,False,weddingplanning,,1536098846.0,9d08cw,"So my fiance and I are building our wedding website from scratch. We want to use it as our main line of communication to everyone who's involved in the wedding and all guests. We will literally be sending a URL and surprise people! But how do you gather people's emails without telling them first what it's for. 

Also on that note, how do you pop bridal party questions? Do you talk to them face to face regarding the wedding and then surprise them with the ""will you be my bridesmaid/groomsmen"" question? Or just send a card asking the question? I won't be doing any wedding favors so I will not be sending them anything when I ask them either. I'm also not asking them to do anything for me except show up to the wedding, look cute, and have fun. Im also buying their dresses and paying for hair and make up. Is it ok to just call them up and ask over the phone? I don't want to put people on the spot either. But I am close to my potential bridesmaids. I'm completely ok with them saying no to me. I just don't want then to feel uncomfortable. 

Any CC would be appreciated. "
79,Tips and best practices for wedding dress shopping?,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb36d2cc0>,Clare-ifiedThoughts,0,9,5,False,weddingplanning,,1536080880.0,9cxmdw,"I am my sister's maid of honor and we are going dress shopping this weekend. She is very much a no-frills, down-to-earth gal. (To be honest, I think she's mostly doing the dress shopping for my, my mom's and her in-laws' benefit; it's v sweet.)   

We have a plan for a few boutiques and for lunch afterward and are going to pack snacks. Still, I've never gone dress shopping and I'd like to be the best, most supportive person I can be for her on what hopefully will be a fun day (clothes shopping is always sort of a emotional gauntlet, yknow?). Any thing that was really great for you brides out there?"

1. Our engagement photos are scheduled for late October in a forest.

2. Fashion choices are hard for me.

Here's the sitch. FH and I are really casual usually. I'm a leather jacket, combat boots and flannel kind of girl usually. I like the idea of getting photos done that are very ""us"". Relaxed. Comfortable. Cozy.

I'm also pagan, so we intended to do a self-led handfasting during our engagement photos as a betrothal ceremony. We like the idea of having some really nice photos of this intimate moment that's literally almost a year and a day from our real wedding date (which is significant in terms of Celtic pagan tradition). However, I felt weird about doing such an important ceremony in our super casual clothes. 

So, I was considering bringing a second outfit. One that's more formal. Like a beautiful flowy, maxi dress in burgundy or hunter green or something with heels. But the thought of searching for a special dress is stressing me out. I'm not great with shopping. I get overwhelmed super easily and just wish I could get the Fab Five from Queer Eye to dress me up so I don't have to worry about whether or not my fashion sense is whack. 

I don't know, guys. I'm freaking out a little internally. 

**Question 1: Should I even feel weird about doing the ceremony in casual clothes?**

**Question 2: Where do you guys go to shop for and try on pretty dresses?**

**Question 3: I have bright red hair and grey eyes. Which colors should I avoid?**"

Zero doubts about the person I am marrying, but plenty of doubts about the wedding, which is going to run about $70k, about $10k over our budget.

Our parents are paying for the wedding which makes me so gateful, and they are fortunate enough where this wont be a strain on their finances, but this decision is making me feel irresponsible and dumb. I always made fun of people who spent so much on a wedding, knowing that i personally would rather take that money for a down payment on a house to start building a life. Yet here I am, and there is no turning back. It is giving me negative feelings about the wedding itself as we get closer to the day, which I really don't want. But I keep thinking about how this all played out and feel pretty terrible.

How do I put this stress and worry out of my mind before my wedding?

We both love the state parks in our area, but none of them really offer a great wedding venue/appropriate shelter. I'm now looking into tents, and I'd love some advice. I think we'd both like an outdoor wedding, but the weather is so unpredictable that we'd definitely need a tent or shelter of some sort. Guessing 100 people max at the wedding... ideally 75 or fewer. 

I feel like buying might come out costing just a bit more than renting, and then there's the option of renting it out after or selling to a local event company. Has anyone done this? Or looked into it? I'd love to hear your advice/experiences with this."
