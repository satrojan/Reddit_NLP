One post per day. Seriously, don’t spam. 

SO bashing is not tolerated. Let me repeat that for those in the back, SO BASHING IS NOT TOLERATED. I speak for all of the mods when I say that it’s super annoying to open up modmail and find numerous reports on comments because people cannot/will not follow the rules. Telling OP to leave their SO and/or insulting the SO will receive a ban. 

Do not DM mods. We prefer that you message us through mod mail so that we can discuss everything together because we are a team. Attempts to triangulate the mods against each other will be met with a temp ban and we will laugh at you. 

Encourage, advise, and comfort, don't fear monger. We are a team of different thoughts, not one hive mind of terror. Fear mongering will earn a temp ban or a perma ban, depending on the severity. That’s up to the mod who handles the report or finds it. 

If you're offended that's your responsibility, not OPs. If you can’t say anything nice in a support group, don’t say anything at all. 

Don't word police. We look for poor attitudes and genuine prejudice, we do not try to fight the useless uphill battle of censorship through word policing. Obviously there's not a place for someone talking about ""daddy's cummies 💦,"" but if it's something MIL said we aren't stopping you from describing relevant information. If you are offended at something not directed specifically towards you that is your responsibility. Still, don't hesitate to hit report it you think it might be hate speech against a group no matter what language used.

We need to respect anonymity here. So no chasing users across various subs or linking to their profile after they’ve deleted their posts. 

/u/Made_you_read_penis should be worshipped as a God, and requires sacrifices of eggplant emojis to be send their way at every possible occasion.

/u/dietotaku needs BTS gifs to survive. 

/u/mysisteristrash is my bae. That’s all. 


We put a lot of time and effort into moderating this subreddit and it’s because we genuinely love what this community has become. Let’s all do our part in making r/JustNoMIL great again.

2,"MIL threatened grandparents rights, earned immediate NC",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb5ea2fd0>,sequinsandpolkadots,0,301,2329,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536076939.0,9cwz36,"Longtime lurker, first time poster. (Yay?) 

DH and I have been married for almost six years, and MIL has been an issue since exactly two weeks before our wedding. Once she realized that we were definitely getting married, it's like a switch flipped. She has constantly disrespected our boundaries, acted like she's a perpetual victim, feels entitled to do whatever she wants, and treats us like crap. She has also made it clear that she believes I married DH for his money, even though I also work full-time. 

For six years, we've gone through these cycles with MIL where she attempts (pretends?) to behave for six to nine months. Then, she doesn't get her way regarding something trivial and has a full-on tantrum that involves her not speaking to us for about three months. Once she's ready to speak to us again, she and FIL start trying to guilt trip DH. The phone calls start. The passive-aggressive love-your-mother Facebook memes appear. That sort of thing. 

After the most recent cycle, DH and I agreed that we couldn't allow this continue, mostly for the sake of LO but also for our own sanity. I was ready to go NC immediately and be done with it. He wanted to have a Come-To-Jesus meeting to try to ""fix"" everything and see if we could work things out with MIL and FIL. Since this was very important to DH, I agreed but only if we didn't bring LO since I knew the situation had the potential to be volatile. 

It went very well, obviously - Sorry for spoiling the entire post in my title. I could write an entire post about our lovely conversation with them. So much WTF. (MIL believes that every thought that goes through her head and every word that comes out of her mouth is THE TRUTH. FIL enables, enables, enables.) The highlight was when she threated grandparents rights 10 minutes into the meeting. DH and I agreed going into the meeting that any threat of grandparents rights was an immediate NC. As soon as the threat was made, we ended the meeting and left. We are now NC with no potential for reconciliation. 

(Side note: Grandparents rights are non-existent in our state if the child's parents are married, not unfit parents and in agreement regarding not allowing their child to have a relationship with the grandparents. Grandparents rights only come into play if the parents are divorced/a parent dies or disappears, and even then, there are stipulations. However, MIL threated legal action involving our child, so we are taking this very seriously. Also, this doesn't mean they won't be able to find some attorney to take their money to attempt to make a case against us.) 

A nom for your llamas: This particular tantrum was caused when MIL posted a picture of LO on FB after explicitly being told not to post pictures of LO on FB, period. She stopped speaking to us because I had the audacity to call her out on FB. (I also reported the picture to Facebook.) During our meeting, she attempted to scold me for not calling her privately to ask her to remove the picture. I told her if someone disrespected a rule regarding MY child, I would call them out any way I pleased. (Direct quote from MIL: ""What's so special about your baby that his picture can't be on Facebook?"") She also had the gall to complain that she doesn't have any updated pictures of LO because DH and I haven't sent her any in three months. Not surprisingly, this isn't the first issue we've had with MIL and FB.

At this point, we have done/are doing the following:
1) got a call into the attorney to see if we need to take any action right now
2) blocked MIL/FIL on social media
3) blocked MIL/FIL phone numbers
4) installed a Ring doorbell
5) will be purchasing a few video surveillance cameras for our home
6) informed my parents who watch LO a few days/week so they are on alert
7) house is clean (and tends to stay that way, thanks to DH), pantry and refrigerator are stocked, and have started fully baby-proofing in the event of a surprise CPS visit.

Is there anything else you'd recommend doing? How over-the-top should we go with the babyproofing? (LO is crawling and pulls up on things, but he's supervised all of the time. At this point, we have cabinets with any cleaning chemicals locked down and outlets covered.) 

Anything we're not thinking of that we should be? 

Edited to add: I'm completely overwhelmed by all of the helpful advice and support I've gotten from this thread. THANK YOU! I appreciate everyone taking the time to respond. "
3,"MIL calls grandbaby ""the b*stard""",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfaea8b240>,Greeneggsandspam555,0,21,633,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536099426.0,9d0b55,"I can remember the exact day I decided I would never let MIL take care of my future kids.  This was light years before I had even thought of marrying DH.  I was probably eighteen at the time.  But, for context I'm going to have to back up even more (thanks for baring with me).

As far as most people know, DH has two siblings.  BIL and SIL3.  When I started dating him, I only knew of those two siblings.  Pretty much all of the other family friends only knew of those two siblings.  It was probably a couple of months into the relationship before DH revealed that he had two older sisters.  SIL1 is completely no contact with MIL (for absolutely solid reasons I can talk about in another post for anyone who is interested). SIL2 was no contact up until a few years ago when she needed someone who could babysit for custody purposes.  Obviously this put her as the ultimate black sheep of the remaining siblings (in a past post I mentioned that MIL referred to her as ""not really my child""), and MIL reveled in having the leverage of regularly babysitting SIL's  daughter, my dear niece (DN).  

I went over to visit while MIL was babysitting, and I immediately fell in love.  DN had to be around 3 at the time.  I excused myself from the boring adults and went to run around with DN in the backyard.  I also witnessed MIL cackling gleefully as she gave DN copious amounts of sweets and soda, loudly proclaiming ""You mommy would be SO MAD when she finds out I'm doing this."" But the icing on the Just No cake, was that MIL lead everyone in jokingly calling her ""litle bastard"" because, LOL, SIL2 had her out of wedlock so she technically IS a bastard.  Isn't' that freaking hilarious?  That's when I promised myself MIL was never going to babysit any of my kids.  

Years later I had the privilege of actually meeting and hanging out with SIL2. She is awesome because she is out of the FOG and is happy to talk frankly about MIL.  I casually mentioned that watching MIL babysit DN made me decide that she would never babysit my kids (I don't even have kids, but I have no doubts about this and I've made it crystal clear to DH).  SIL asked, ""oh, yeah, because of the sugar?"" 

I replied, ""no, because she was always calling DN 'the bastard'.""

It turns out SIL2 had no idea.  I actually felt really bad that I brought it up, because she had already stopped letting MIL babysit, and it obviously really hurt her feelings.  She is an amazing mom and worked incredibly hard to build an awesome career while supporting DN.  MIL still talks crap about DN. When my mom met DN she was surprised that she was so smart and well behaved because MIL portrays her as kind of a ""wild child"".  I had the privilege of babysitting her for a couple of days while I was in town (somehow without calling her any names or loading her up on sugar),  and I can tell you she is a freaking angel child and anyone who says differently can fight me.

4,Was hoping I wouldn’t have anything to post for a while,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfae247fd0>,ohreallynowlinda,0,67,737,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536087435.0,9cylvd,"I am writing to you from home state as we have been here a few days now. I am the woman who’s MIL came in my room after I delivered and took my baby to another room and had me and the hospital staff freaking out for a while after I lost my infant daughter two years ago. 

So the current situation had us returning to home state unfortunately. My in laws live in a midwestern state that has had some awful weather recently. My FIL and BIL work construction and were driving in one of their work vehicles during a bad storm. Their truck was was hit head on by another large truck that had hydroplaned. The driver of the other truck was killed instantly and my FIL and BIL were severely injured. BIL we are not sure if he will recover from his injuries as he has not woken up since the accident and FIL is awake but had broken bones and a lacerated liver. He has had a couple surgeries so far to repair the damage. There might be more in the near future. 

Of course hearing this DH and I with our son flew to home state.  MIL is a hot mess. She is trying to stay together and not freak out but I don’t know if she is taking too many meds or not enough or just losing her freaking mind. She sits in the chair shaking and staring at either FIL or BIL depending on who’s room she is in then gets up and mutters to herself and cries.  I’m sure she is scared to death to lose her husband and her son but I don’t think she is anywhere close to normal. 

I have put aside my issues with her for the moment. I need to be here for DH because he has gone through so much recently. If BIL doesn’t make it DH is going to be lost. His brother is his best friend. We are scared. 

When we arrived at the hospital the first day I had brought son with us because one of DH’s cousins couldn’t get to us yet to pick him up to watch him. We knew it would be an awkward meeting but I wanted to see FIL and BIL too. I love them very much. MIL was waiting for us in the waiting room since we couldn’t take little man into the ICU.  She burst into tears seeing us and nearly toppled DH over with her hug. She looked like she didn’t know what to do with me so she said hello and waved. I’ll give it to her for not trying to jump on me too. I could tell she wanted to take the carrier from me because she wanted to hold little man but she stopped herself. 

She took DH in first then she took me into each of their rooms. FIL was doped up pretty well with a lot bruising but he smiled at me and squeezed my hand. BIL looked nothing like himself with all the tubes and wires. I cried and MIL rubbed my back like we were a normal family. After that cousin took the baby for a while and we talked about prognosis for both. The day after we got not good news on BIL about the swelling in his brain and responsiveness. MIL has now gone we think three days without really eating a whole and only napping here and there. I guess that is probably adding to her craziness. 

She did call at like 2 am last night as we have
Been staying at a friend’s home. She asked if she could see the baby for breakfast. DH told her to go back to sleep or whatever she was doing and don’t call at 2am.  He hung up and confronted her this morning about it.  She says she doesn’t remember calling. He said she looks like she hadn’t slept at all and is running on fumes. So who knows maybe she sleep dialed or something. Or she really is losing her mind. 

I really wish this bad shit would stop. Our little family needs some healing time. "
5,"Moisturizer Nazi got a taste of her own medicine, and DH is on my side again (update)",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfae24c3c8>,cindyxloowho,0,131,712,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536086928.0,9cyj9o,"(TL;DR of this whole ordeal: DH basically went full mama’s boy with JNMIL after she moved in with us and was letting her read my angry texts. They cracked a joke about my moisturizer choices and that was the last straw. DH promised to talk to her, but never did.)
Also, potato format cause I’m on mobile.

Thank you to everyone for your advice, it really helped me grow some hypothetical balls. 

As I stated in my last update, DH started seeing my point of view, for an entire night, before JNMIL sucked him back into his unhealthy sharing of our relationship problems. 
Since he’s off work on Saturdays, I formed a plan. A plan to give each of them a taste of their own medicine. First, I invited my cousin and sisters over without telling either of them. I made sure they came over when they both least expected it, bright and early.  When they showed up, I decided to let my sisters make breakfast. DH walks out and is visibly irritated. My sister asks if he wants some eggs and bacon, he says sure and sits down with us. Like clockwork, this is when JNMIL decides to join us as well. We’re all eating breakfast and my sisters and cousin bring up the fact that my daughter’s birthday is coming up soon. JNMIL says “I know, it really sucks that I have to visit my other son in (state) &amp; miss the party.” to which my cousin responds with “That sucks, OP’s  mom is planning the entire thing and even took off work that weekend to make sure it was perfect. I wish you could be here to see it.” 
Keep in mind, this is the same cousin i vented to about everything prior to this, so I was doing an internal victory scream when she said this.
JNMIL replies “I know, I just really want to be there for my son and see my newest grandbaby. She looks *just* like him.” 

After everyone’s done eating, cousin decides to try and bait JNMIL into talking bad about me in front of my sisters. She says “Isn’t it nice not having to cook breakfast?” I almost expected JNMIL to not say anything, then again, she wouldn’t be a JNMIL if she didn’t. 
She says “OP never makes breakfast like this cause she usually just gives the kids cereal, so yeah it is.” 
Bingo. 
My sisters darted their eyes at each other and my youngest sister says “Well, it *is* hard cooking for three kids as it is, let alone two adults on top of that.” 
JNMIL rebuttals with “I used to make a big  breakfast for my 5 children and my husband every morning when I didn’t work.” 
My middle sister starts picking up on what I was talking about and replies “Well, DH could always make his own breakfast if he wants a big meal, OP is the one with the kids all the time. It’s only fair.” 
JNMIL scrunches up her face and says “He shouldn’t have to, he works so she can stay home all day. I used to stay at home with my kids too and I still managed to get a warm breakfast made every morning until I started working again.” 
DH notices the tension rising and changes the subject by saying “What do you guys want to do today?”. My cousin says “We just wanted to visit for the day. OP has been telling me how lonely she’s been feeling, so we thought we’d come keep her company.” 
DH gives me a ‘wtf you told them?’ look. 
I ignore it. 
Skip to the evening, JNMIL asks what we want for dinner. 
Middle Sister decided to reply with “Isn’t OP gonna cook? You said she never makes big meals, you should let her cook for you.” 
JNMIL says “Well, she does cook but it’s usually just the same old stuff.” 
My youngest sister starts getting irritated, 
“Well, you don’t want her to cook, then you get mad at her for not cooking? That makes no sense!” 
I get a text from DH that says “Tell your sister to calm down, dude.” 
My inner smart ass jumped out and I tell my sister, “DH just texted me to tell you to calm down.” 
My cousin &amp; oldest sister are holding back chuckles now. 
Youngest sister is fully triggered at this point. 
She tells JNMIL, “You know what? I’m not gonna calm down, cause I don’t think you should putting OP down all the time. That’s my sister, and I’m not gonna let you talk about her that way without saying anything.” 
It gets quiet again, and my sisters and cousin get up to go outside to play on the trampoline with my kids. 
The doorbell rings and I realize DH ordered some pizzas. 
When I go to the door to get them, JNMIL sees me and loses it  “Are you seriously that vindictive that you’re gonna waste money on pizza when I *just* offered to cook dinner? Are you really *that* upset over what I said? I didn’t mean it that way, you need to get over yourself! All I said was that you didn’t know how to cook like me, it was supposed to be a joke!! You &amp; your family are being ridiculous!” 
I was left speechless and was about to start crying, when DH walks up and says “THAT IS ENOUGH MOM! I ORDERED THEM! LEAVE HER THE HELL ALONE ! WHY CAN’T YOU EVER JUST BE NICE TO HER? STOP!! YOU’RE PISSING ME OFF NOW!” 
JNMIL was obviously caught off guard, and she scoffs and replies “ Well, how was I supposed to know that? You know I don’t mean it like that! She’s allowed to bitch at you all the time, but I’m not allowed to tease her about one little thing? Do we all have to treat her like a baby now?” She looks and sees that I’m crying, rolls her eyes and sits down at the table. 
My sisters and cousin bring our kids back inside to eat, then pull me aside and ask what’s wrong. I tell them, and my sister storms into the kitchen and asks my children to go outside again for a minute. 
They leave, and she starts going in “YOU SHOULD BE THANKFUL THAT OP &amp; DH ARE EVEN LETTING YOU LIVE HERE! IF I WERE HER, I WOULD’VE KICKED YOU OUT WEEKS AGO!” 
JNMIL claps back with “SHE TREATS MY SON LIKE SHIT! SHES ALWAYS BITCHING AT HIM AND PUTTING HIM DOWN! MAYBE YOU SHOULD TALK TO HER, NOT ME!” 
At this point DH is visibly pissed, “OKAY! EVERYONE WHO DOESN’T LIVE HERE, LEAVE! NOW!” JNMIL puts on a smug smile, then DH says “YOU TOO MOM!”.  She packs a bag and has a cab take her to his sister’s house. 
JNMIL hasn’t talked to me since, but DH said she’s coming back tonight and wants to have a “civil” conversation with the both of us. 
I told him I wanted her out by the start of December and he said okay. 
Will post another update after this.

6,"Bitter Cow has been busy over the past couple months. She managed to get herself NC with her GC and have SIL, her favorite FM call the police on her.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb6a40d68>,WashYourTaco,0,17,294,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536101570.0,9d0kwd,"I haven’t posted in a while, but a lot has happened in Bitter Cow’s world. Everything is crumbling around her and now she is desperately trying to twist the narrative that she is a poor victim in all of this. I have actually been NC with BC and her FM sisters since January of 2017, but DH is VLC with BC (he will answer if she calls him and talk to her for about 5-15 minutes once a month or so). So, BC and FIL completely ignored the fact that my DH had broken his femur and needed major surgery. They never came see him or even bother to so much as text him to see how he was doing. BC sent BIL’s wife (who was BC’s FM and I’ll refer to as SIL) to antagonize us in public to try to make DH write BC a love note on a napkin to take back to BC like we are in middle school. SIL was awful to me and DH didn’t really stand up for me in the moment, but this was only a few weeks out from his surgery and he was on crutches and pain medicine so we worked through it and the whole incident caused DH to go off on BC and told her how inappropriate that was for her to send SIL like that and how out of line SIL was. BC instantly defended SIL and told him that I was being a bitch (I literally stood there and took SIL’s treatment of me that night and never said a word which DH saw as he was next to me the whole time). DH told her that isn’t what happened and BC still tried to twist it so that we were the awful ones. This whole time however she knew that SIL was cheating on her son and behaving eratically, but was covering that up to keep up the narrative that I was a horrible person.

Well, all was quiet from her for a couple months, but SIL started posting things online that were odder than usual and I started to suspect that all was not well with her and BIL. My suspicions were even stronger when suddenly BC was texting my DH about wanting to visit (her excuse for not coming to see him once he was home from the hospital was that she and Fil were just too busy even though neither of them work and live less than 20 minutes from us) and deploying guilt tripping, “we are just so lonely it hurts!” (Basically, BIL and SIL were probably not getting along with her anymore so she needed her narc fuel from DH). DH ignored these texts. She then started frantically texting randomly asking if we were all right. I told DH that something must be going on with BIL and his wife and she was trying to shift her focus to us and make a mess in our lives since she was probably being shut out from BIL.

I only know what is going on from what BC has told DH over the phone, but BC is claiming that SIL cheated on BIL. Now, based on what SIL posted online, she was seeing someone, so I know that is true, but I also know BIL likely has cheated as well as the fact that he has an anger issue and treats SIL extremely poorly and always has. BC said that SIL told BIL that she wanted a divorce before moving out of their home. BC decided then to do what she does best and try to control the situation which always leads to her turning everything into a massive dumpster fire.

BIL needed to go out of town for work and had BC take him to the airport since SIL wasn’t speaking to him or living with him. She found out BIL and SIL’s kids (unfortunately they have several young children that get dragged through their dysfunction) were with SIL’s friend. BC then went pick up the kids from the friend and took them to BIL and SIL’s house and called her FM sisters over to help her. SIL didn’t know where they took her kids and she wasn’t living in that house with BIL since she left him for this other guy at the time claiming that BIL was abusive. SIL called the police not knowing where her kids are since BC picked them up from SIL’s friend’s house telling the friend that SIL told her to. BC and her drama loving sisters decide to take the kids to AIL1’s house. The police call FIL to find out where they are to get them to bring the kids to their mother and FIL who jumps to aggression, screaming and intimidation tactics the second he is called out for something starts going off on the officer trying to argue that Bitter Cow didn’t do anything wrong and that the kids were staying with them. Eventually BC gets the phone from him to talk to the police herself and try to turn on her poor old grandma act and at this point the police let her know that she will be charged with kidnapping if they don’t bring the kids to their mother immediately since they already talked to BIL and he said that the kids are supposed to be with SIL not BC. BC lost her mind. She called BIL screaming about throwing her under the bus and that she was helping him. He is now NC with BC.

BC tends to do really petty things all the time to make herself feel like she has won something against someone, but it usually just has the opposite effect. She has decided that BIL needs to be saved from SIL and that if she could get custody of the kids, then BIL will come back to her and leave SIL. She had AIL call CPS on SIL, saying that the house had no food or diapers for the kids. The house that SIL wasn’t living in because she had moved out. SIL had food and diapers and everything the kids needed where she had moved to. SIL and BIL are actually back together now (they are extremely dysfunctional, but DH and I knew they would likely get back together) and they are no longer talking to BC because they know she called CPS on them and was trying to take their kids. SIL’s family has also cut out BC now as well so she can’t manipulate SIL’s family into letting her see the kids either.

This all leads up to BC wailing on the phone to DH about how she is a great parent and has no idea where she went wrong with BIL, but she doesn’t have the self-awareness to realize that she couldn’t be bothered to see how DH was doing when he had a major medical emergency and hasn’t seen her in 9 months now even though they live 20 minutes away and her other kid that she babied and who’s life she tried to control is somewhat in shambles and also not talking to her. Mother of the year everyone. At least one thing will be consistent in that she won’t ever see or be around our future kid either."
7,FMIL Hijacks Wedding Date/Venue for Separate Event,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb6a77630>,marsbringerofsmores,0,77,281,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536101784.0,9d0lwp,"Hi everyone! Using an alt and have changed some details for better anonymity.

My FMIL and I always had a good relationship and she seemed really happy that her son and I were planning to get engaged. ""Weddings make people crazy,"" my sister warned me, but I didn't listen. So I was totally off guard when FH and I got engaged for real, and FMIL suddenly started being a drama queen.

We went to dinner at FH's parents house soon after the engagement. FMIL didn't say congratulations at any point in the evening, and socially awkward FDIL had to remind her that we were celebrating. She asked to see my ring, but then just said, ""It's pretty,"" and that was the end of that.

We discussed our wedding plans and dates with them. FMIL is a big deal in the ornamental arborist (read: fancy trees) community and we were planning on having our ceremony in the public ornamental garden that FMIL has overseen for years. We thought it would be a nice gesture to incorporate her life's work in our wedding, and she seemed so excited about it. She immediately suggested a date late next year when the trees would look their best, and since she's the expert, we settled on that date.

That was all the wedding talk that we were able to get in - it was literally about 10 minutes - before FMIL changed the subject to herself. She started complaining about her job, and how everyone was against her, and how no one appreciated what she did for the company. She spent the next TWO HOURS throwing herself a pity party and even mentioned that if she was too upset, she might not be able to make our wedding. 

At that point, I just made an excuse and we left. Her behavior was so out of left field that I didn't know what to make of it. I talked to FH about it and we agreed that she must be stressed because she recently found out that her brother has a life-threatening illness and is taking it hard.

Fast forward to a couple of weeks later, and I have been a busy bee getting all of our vendors lined up, making plans and deposits, and feeling really proud of how well it was all coming together. Then FH gets a call from his mom. We were still kind of mad at her for her crappy attitude the last time we saw her, but he figured maybe she had calmed down.

Instead of apologizing for hijacking dinner to whine about her life, FMIL told us that she had put in a permit for her arborist group to hold a demonstration AT THE ORNAMENTAL GARDEN ON THE DAY OF OUR WEDDING. This fucking bitch snuck in and informally reserved the space using internal connections before we got our permit approved. 

I am livid. I spent most of yesterday just laying in bed watching TV because I couldn't figure out why she would do this. She's since sent me a series of texts talking about how she would be so hurt if we put in our permit for the same day since she already invited all of her arborist group and supposedly advertised the event to the public.

I'm so floored, I have no idea what to do. Like I said up top, she and I were really close and cool with each other before. FH is her only son, but I she never showed any weird Jocasta tendencies. I thought she genuinely wanted us to be happy together, but this stunt proves otherwise. I feel like if we forge ahead and try to officially book the garden, it will destroy any relationship that might be salvaged. But if we let her do this, she will feel she can push us around. On the upside, FH is 100% on my side and is making no excuses for his mom's behavior. 

I'm so mad and overwhelmed. I feel like I had this well-oiled machine of planning going and then FMIL came in from left field and dumped sand all it its gears. :("

A thirteen-year-old shouldn’t have that. She should have a volleyball poster or a lipgloss-smudged Jonas brothers cardboard cutout (or whatever the kids are into these days).

Anyway, I got in the car with Republimom and she started doing her typical screaming and I did something I’d never done before: I greyrocked. I greyrocked as fuck. I just sat there and let the ADHD daydreams take me away.

​

We were MAYBE two minutes down the road when she pulls over and orders me out of the car and tells me to find my own way home. I gladly oblige. I mean, it’s maybe a five minute drive from my school to home, and the route is basically straight, left, driveway. It was along some busy sidewalk-less main roads but I could walk in the grass, no biggie.

​

Maybe 20 minutes goes by and I see Republimom’s black car appear again, and my heart fucking sinks. I’m about to be herded back into hell. She picks me up in the car, and is screaming at me again for walking along the major roads because “what would people think if they saw you walking home on the side of the road? They’d think I’m a bad mother!”

​

So it’s ok to kick your child out of a car and make them walk home alone, as long as no one looks down on you for it. K."

I won’t go into details but long story short is that my boyfriends mom wants to be called “mama” by our daughter. 
It’s apparently Filipino culture, and she has 3 other grandchildren that call her that. 

I am not Filipino, I’m Puerto Rican and In Spanish “mama” means mom. and my daughter has already started to call me “Mama”. I never forced it on her, it’s just come naturally for her. 

I don’t want her calling his mom “mama.” I just want her to call her grandma or something else. Anything but “mama”. 

What do you guys think? I’m stressing out over this and my boyfriend doesn’t agree with me. He also wants our daughter to call her mama and I’m 100% against it.

This takes place before the whole message cheating thing. 

This is the tale of the wedding dress, now to preface me and my dh are not traditional at all he helped me chose my wedding dress on line measure me and send off for it. When pq found out she started going on about tradition how it wasn't right (cry me a river). Dh asked if she paid for it, she replied no he responds with well you don't get a say, (I told you all he is awesome as hell).

Now we had travelled down once again to see them, and things were actually going okay between pq and me, I decided to throw her a bone and showed her my dress, now to me it's gorgeous fitted to the waist then kinda comes out like a skater skirt to just above the knee. She is umm and ahhing over it and actually being generally nice about it.

She then comes out with gem I have a simialr dress in pink I think I will wear it to your wedding, record scratch what, like hell you will. I didn't dear readers say anything in the moment I was shocked. Later on that evening me and dh where talking and I told him what his mum had said, needless to say he wasn't happy he went down stairs and asked me to follow him, he out right asked his mum what was said and the daft bint repeated word for word what she said to me, he played along and was like oh beautiful can I see it, and dear readers I'm ashamed I doubted my dh and was about to kill him, as she scampers off to get the dress he looks at me and says don't worry, at this point I'm still shooting him daggers.

She come down stairs with a dress that isn't like mine guys it was identical and when he looked at the tag it was from the same shop and everything and neon pink! He takes the dress pretending to inspect then looks her straight in the eye and says mum if you so much as entertain the thought of wearing this dress or turning up to my wedding in it you will not be welcome, you will look ridiculous in a neon pink dress the same dress my wife will be wearing, and I will tell everyone you ordered it specially for the wedding to match the bride (her image is her everything) and tell them we told you not to. She splutters out some excuses and says she won't wear it, the subject was left alone after that.

Upon returning home with my dh I'm unpacking and discover the dress my dh didn't fully trust her, so he stashed it so she had no access to it, she never mentioned the dress going missing and never as far as I know brought the subject up again."

The group is about Gentle Parenting (my SO and I have a babber).She carefully clipped them to make sure she didn’t include my comments and tried to make it look like I was sneaking around behind his back to take custody of our child. 

Now is a good time for me to add that I love my SO, he’s an amazing father. I don’t want him to leave the room half the time, let alone leave our lives. We need him and love him. 

The best part of the story is that I used that post (which my SO knew about) to ask for advice to be a kinder partner to him when we disagree. We had read the post and all of its comments together as a spring board for solving the original problem together. 

TL:DR, showed my boyfriend nice things I said on the internet, his mom tired to spin it as mean. Also, why is she stalking me in Facebook groups? She’s not even my on my friend list. "
12,"Meet Jamie, the MIL who uses teenage-tv-show logic to break us up.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfae24c128>,Mucheng,0,17,236,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536090785.0,9cz37h,"Hello! I'm really bad with nicknames on this so I'm just going to call my MIL Jamie.

Yeah, the in-laws are both pretty awful and I don't think it will ever change. I'll start out with backstory: my husband's parents had him as teenagers and were divorced before he could remember, and both parents remarried. His father and his step-mother are the awesome in-laws who live states away. I consider his father's new wife to be my actual mother-in-law, because she actually treats me like someone in the family. His biological mother who he grew up with is the fucking devil, that would be Jamie. Jamie had another kid with step-father-in-law when my husband was 10, so the sister-in-law is now a teenager with quite the mouth on her. Since she was born, my husband was put on a back burner. Jamie would cry and tell my husband that she hated him for looking just like his father. She would manipulate him into not going to see his father even though legally he was supposed to have custody during breaks.

In the beginning of our relationship, she tried her damndest to get us to break up. It was almost teenage-tv-show comical the things she would do. He was 19 when we started dating and they would monitor his texts between the two of us (He wasn't even on their phone plan...they wouldn't let him be on the phone plan since he got a phone, he had to pay for it himself. Even when he was 13, he was paying for his own phone using allowance and money given from grandparents). She would then use the information against us. At one point, she took some of the sexting we had back and forth and video footage of in-home security cameras (more like a spy cam) of me (a consenting adult) giving him (another consenting adult) a blow job. She took the ""proof"" over to my parents house (my father is a preacher/deacon and both my parents are highly religious) so that my father would be pissed and force us to break up. Unannounced to my parents' home. She then asked my parents to make me leave because she ""did not want me to defend myself"". My parents told her she wasn't allowed to come into their house uninvited and then boss their child around, but I was still trying to be on her good terms and excused myself. Despite her efforts of showing the videos and appealing to my father's religious side, he just called her a child, told her that it was obvious they were teenagers when they had my husband and that they would eventually learn to let go once they grew up. He then told them ""I taught my daughter what I wanted to teach her, and she is 18 and makes her own decisions. Think twice before turning me against my daughter. Now if you excuse me, your son and I are going to go see a movie. We have been excited about this for weeks.""

Jamie then invited my parents over one day and my parents just left. They didn't really stay long nor did they tell me the things they said. My mom said that she was basically saying I wasn't good enough for her son (you know, the one she mistreated while he grew up). My parents cut ties with them immediately, saying they made them uncomfortable.

When none of these attempts worked, Jamie kicked her son out to live with his dad. This meant he had to stop going to college (despite him doing well and having full-ride scholarships, he still wasn't able to afford dorm-life without her help) and he had to get away from me. We spent a year apart before we decided I would go live with him over there. She called and told him I was manipulative and abusive, my love was conditional, that it wasn't worth having someone mentally broken who had been in a mental hospital, and that he should wait for someone who actually finished college. He then got mad at her for the first time in his life and said ""you don't get the privilege to even speak her name"". When she figured out that wasn't working, she switched to threatening him with not speaking to him again and taking him off her insurance. He did get scared by this (I don't blame him...she is a horrible woman) and cancelled the whole living together thing.

I later got a call from Jamie's mother who told me she was on my side and that Jamie just doesn't know how to handle losing her son to another woman. She apparently told Jamie to quit bothering us and that if she didn't, she was going to have a one-way ticket to a ruined relationship with her son. After that phone call, things were very quiet. Jamie didn't talk to me, or my parents. She would invite my husband on family vacations and wouldn't get mad when she was denied for having not also inviting me.

And then...we eloped. They weren't present (hardly anyone was, only our witnesses and the officiant). When we told them, she had a fit and said ""we would've paid for the wedding!"" Her reaction when I spoke up and said ""HAHAH! Oh god, what? No, you wouldn't have"" was priceless, and she shut up again.

Now, she lets her daughter mistreat me. She, herself, acts as though tolerates my existence in my husband's life, but she laughs and gives high fives to her daughter when she says things that are particularly vulgar and offensive about me. She flat out encourages her daughter to be an absolute bitch. At one point I was holding hands with my husband while we were all out and sister-in-law purposefully slid in between me and my husband and pushed me away. When my husband got onto her about how pushing is not okay, Jamie got onto *him* about *his* behavior for yelling at her precious daughter (excuse me...your precious daughter just physically assaulted his wife, yeah he will be mad)

I've just stopped going out with them entirely. I tell my husband he can go, but I will not be. Last time I saw her was on mother's day where I didn't say anything and wouldn't let them pay for our meal or have any kind of leverage over us. We dined, paid, and left."

A little background, she has a conceal and carry. She has a history of mental illness. No I do NOT let her near our DD. She tried to forcefully grab my Dd from while arms while she was feeding. She tells me I'm ""stealing away her son"". This has been going on for two years. 

I'm pretty sure she just threatened me. I'm not sure if I should go to the police or if I'm over reacting? Her behavior is so unstable right now, she is all over the map. And I am freaking out. 


Text exchange:

MIL-""IF u want to keep demonizing me-keep it up""

Me-""Nothing wrong with help. It's when someone wants to take a title from you that is so great.  mother""

Me-""Get over the fact that I don't want you calling yourself mommy Mary. ""

Me-""Why can't you respect that??

Me-is that a threat? (Realizing what the heck I just read)

MIL-"" (name)- you are really crazy :-(""

Me- ""are you threatening me""

MIL-"" yes OH MY""

I'm trying to get a hold of my husband but he's working on a roof today so I can't reach him. I am shaking. I am mad and I am scared. I don't know how to get the whole conversation on here but it is like...I'm very scared. 

Should I go to the police? Wait for my husband? I can't think right now. 

Edit: I haven't let our DD around her since May. 

***** Responses have been huge and more than I expected. But I'd like to thank each and every one of you for responding. I don't know how much more I can post about this if it goes any further and some sort of legal action is required. Let's hope it doesn't come to that. I still believe in forgiveness and second chances, but she needs professional help before we can have any sort of relationship. Before she sees my child. Doors are locked and she does live far away. My husband is home and completely has my back. I'll try to post the full conversation, I'm not very good at this and the exchange  is long,  so it might take a bit to get it all here. "
14,"""I made your vagina! You're not allowed to use it!"" Says My Mother",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb6075ef0>,EzraViolet2,0,41,158,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536094981.0,9czp5x,"Yes, my mother really said that to me. Yes, she was serious. Not sure if anyone remembers me, my other account got deleted but I'm under the same name again. The last time I updated, my head space was pretty dark and it showed in the post so that got deleted, apologies mods. Anyways, some memorable moments with my mother have been her accusing me of masturbating to hearing her have sex, accusing me of trying to seduce a grown man when I was 11, threatening to burn my fingers off as a child if I ever touched a lighter, treating me like absolute trash while I was in the hospital after a suicide attempt, told me in graphic detail how she received oral, would say sexual things that would make me very uncomfortable,  the list goes on.

​

Even through all that though, the thing she does that I can't stand the most is try to control my personal life. She told me my whole life I wasn't allowed to date until an age she chose, any potential boyfriend would need to be vetted and approved by her, not allowed to have sex unless she approved and gave the okay, but only after talking to the guy beforehand, no sexual talk of any kind with any guy ever, no telling anyone I was a virgin, dates are only allowed to be held at the tim hortons 20 minutes from my house, must text her every 10 minutes and update her as the date goes on, ask the guy a list of questions she came up with and report back to her with the answers, no one was allowed in the house. She said if she ever found out I was dating behind her back or had a guy over, no matter my age, she would kick me out. I could maaaaaaaybe understand a mothers concern for her daughter dating if the daughter was say 15 and the ""rules"" were less extreme. But I'm 18 ffs. And it's funny she has the no guest rule but constantly had men over and would loudly have sex with them when I was home, when I was a child.

​

Today she asked me if I was ready to start dating yet, I said no. I got enough on my plate and enough bullshit from her, I do not need the stress of dating and dealing with her extra shit. She went on to again explain to me all her rules. I lost my cool and told her for the 10000th time, I was not following her rules. She's been giving hand jobs since she was in like 6th fucking grade, she's a self proclaimed feminist (more like feminazi) and constantly talks about how sexually liberated she is and yet this is the shit she tries to stick her adult daughter with. I told her she was crazy and a hypocrite, if I want to have sex, I will. It is none of her business. She screamed at me ""I MADE YOUR VAGINA, YOU AREN'T ALLOWED TO USE IT UNTIL I GIVE YOU PERMISSION!"" I kinda just stared at her like did you really say that?

​

Mom- ""YOU ARE MY DAUGHTER, YOU WILL DO AS I SAY.""Me- ""Yeah nah, I'm not your fucking property. I'm done talking about this with you, you're insane.""

Mom- ""WHO ARE YOU EVEN GONNA HAVE SEX WITH! WHO WOULD HAVE SEX WITH YOU??? STOP BEING A BAD GIRL AND DO AS MOMMY SAYS!!! YOU'RE NOT READY, YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING!""

I stopped engaging at that point. She calmed down and tried to tell me ""Mommy just loves you so much honey, I only want you to be safe. A mother knows her daughter and I know you're not ready and I need to make sure you don't regret your decision."" I think she may be bipolar. Half the time she's trying to be her weird version of a loving parent, referring to herself as Mommy and telling me how much she loves me. The other times she's calling me every name under the sun, insulting me, making fun of my appearance, calling me fat, saying she doesn't give a shit if I kill myself, telling me if I weren't her daughter she wouldn't like me.

My silence apparently meant I was lying about not wanting to date and when my girl-friend texted me and I refused to show my mother my phone, she blew up again and was convinced I was talking to a guy.

""OMG YOU'RE TALKING TO A GUY! GIVE ME YOUR PHONE! GIVE ME YOUR PHONE NOW! HOW OLD IS HE? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, STOP BEING A BAD GIRL, YOU BETTER NOT HAVE A PROFILE UP, YOU BETTER NOT BE SEEING ANYONE, YOU BETTER STILL BE A VIRGIN!!!""

​

So yeah, that was my day.

15,"Princess Tantrum and the Thanks she was expecting, but did not receive",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb6066cf8>,quietaccount34,0,12,68,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536111571.0,9d1tiw,"I have to be vague about some of this because it would be pretty identifying. I think the example I remember reading a while back was using weasels, so here we go.  


DH is a very good weasel rancher. And his current community of fellow weasel ranchers wanted to give him an honor at a semi-annual weasel rancher dinner, for a weasel stampede a few months back where he showed himself to be an especially adept weasel rancher. 

He was excited, and deservedly so, so he shared on social media about the award. Immediately, Princess Tantrum starts texting him about it, because SHE HAS TO GO. He didn't want to tell her, but couldn't think of an excuse (we're both still working on not JADEing) so he relented and told her she could come. She already claimed credit on the social media post, ""you are a good man who was raised by a good mother..."" ,-direct quote. Points to DH though, because he told PT that we would not all be driving together after she tried to talk him into coming and picking her up.

Last night was the dinner. There were about 80-100 people there, which would have me freaked out, but DH is great at wrangling weasels and working a room. Plus he knew almost everyone there. Princess Tantrum tried to drag him around to meet everyone, but instead he shook her off and went to get us drinks. She took herself around the room explaining who she was. It was really cringey, but at least she was away from the table for most of it. She did plenty of other BEC things, but this was where it got good:

When they announced his name, they played a snippet from a song from DH's favorite band. So that derailed his thank you speech because he started telling this story about how Princess Tantrum got angry that he liked this band, because his Uncle liked the same band and according to PT, ""uncle was bad news.""

The crowd laughs, and she titters next to me, but I can see she is starting to get embarassed/pissed. 

Next DH talks about how his parents took him to a weasel rodeo when he was a kid because they couldn't find a babysitter, and that was when he thought maybe he would like to make a  career out of weasel ranching. More tittering, more bulgy eyes. He did not thank her or his dad. 

Instead, he jumps into how I supported him going into Weasel ranching when he got out of the military, and all through school and was so grateful for the sacrifices the kids and I had made. It was super touching, I honestly didn't expect it, so I was a little misty eyed and a bit flushed.

 Princess Tantrum politely clapped, but turned back around in her seat so she was no longer facing the stage. Her expression was a cross between one of the heads from Easter Island and that vortex to hell that Buffy shoved Angel into. I knew she was really pissed when she didn't try to hug DH before me when he got back to the table. I was telling him good job and some not family-friendly suggestions for later, and she used the break to high tail it out of there without saying goodbye. DH made a comment wondering how long before she blasted him for not properly thanking her.

As of today, she deleted all of her posts about his event/award except for the one where she takes credit. And she made 3 posts blaming him for why her day is going so poorly, including complaining that he won't come over and organize her computer cords for her. Entitled, much?

The crown jewel was when SIL put up a post asking about people's experiences in a certain magical land, because ""next year, her WHOLE\[sic\] family is going..."" and she is looking for suggestions for somewhere everyone can stay together. Now, we had talked about this trip earlier this year. Preliminary planning took place, but had died off once summer started because of how hectic everyone's schedules were.

HOWEVER, SIL tagged herself, BIL, PT, mostly yes AIL, and UIL (yes, the same one that SIL has accused of being a child molester, go figure) in the post, implying that's the whole family. This was highlighted by AIL sending me a message asking if we could take care of their animals, since SIL told her that DH and I were not going. I don't care, because I would rather not go anywhere with them, let alone across the country. DH was irritated, but overall is doing a lot better about not taking the bait from either of these bitches. Meanwhile, I have gone around and taken the appropriate screenshots. I had a boss once tell me, ""always give people enough rope to hang themselves with,"" and it is a lesson that serves me well with these nutjobs. 

Oh, and bonus, FIL and SMIL babysat Baby for us while we were at the event. MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!"

We were staying with my in laws while we were finding a house. (We found one and are out of there!!!) My youngest son is in the stage of “talking” on the phone. He has an old Motorola flip phone that has been past down from both of his older brothers to play with. One of his favorite things to do is go around to everyone in the house and telling them “for you!” It’s adorable and easy to play. You take the phone, say ‘thank you’ to youngest son and pretend to talk on the phone for a few seconds before handing it back! Then youngest son takes the phone and runs off to the next person!

But this wouldn’t be posted here if my MIL took the time to fuel his imagination. Nope. MIL looks at the phone with a sneer and says “I’m not taking that.” Then walks away. Poor little guy didn’t know what to do. So he tries again to hand it to her. My MIL takes it this time, but instead of ‘answering’ it she flips it closed and puts it on a counter where youngest son can’t reach.

Luckily the little guy has an awesome older sister who saw the whole thing go down. She takes the the phone and pretends to answer it before giving it back to her baby brother. 

I know that this is a mild story compared to others but I still wanna shake the bitch for not playing along. The kid isn’t even 2 yet! It takes 30 seconds out of your life to make him happy, just answer the damn phone!

As I posted yesterday, Darth Potter decided to crash a baby shower for a couple she's met once. What her end game was, I haven't a single fucking clue, but she was there for about 90 minutes before she was ""escorted"" off the property. And, without further ado, I humbly present ""Things Darth Potter thinks are appropriate for a baby shower"" or ""Dumb Shit my MIL Does, Vol 1.""

1. She brought a bottle of Jagermiester, and tried to get everyone to do shots. When told it wasn't that kind of party, she started doing shots by herself, so it ""wouldn't go to waste.""

2. She knocked over a picture, breaking the frame, then tried to blame it on the dog. When told that my friends didn't own a dog, she was shocked, because ""gay guys love dogs! How can they raise a child if they don't practice on a dog first?!?""

3. Tried to braid the surrogate's hair. She didn't ask first, just grabbed and started braiding.

4. Tried to claim dibbs on using the surrogate next. When told that you can't claim dibbs on another humans uterus, tried to double down by offering a lot of money for the next kid. The surrogate is a close friend of this family, and considers bearing a child for them to be a gift.

5. When told again that the surrogate wasn't a rent-a-womb, tearfully announced that it was her only chance to be a grandmother, due to my ""infertility"". I'm not infertile, I've just chosen not to have kids. The reason is none of her business and shall remain so until the end of time. Also, she has two other children who can provide her with a do-over baby.

6. Asked the soon-to-be parents if they were going to have their kid do ""gay hobbies"". When asked what she ment by gay hobbies, she clarified by saying jazz-tap and interior design. One does MMA, the other enjoys fly-fishing, but if it isn't a stereotype, Darth Potter doesn't believe a gay person can enjoy it.

And finally, for her grand finale, (drumroll) when told that she was being inappropriate, asked if they were mad at her, or just upset that Aretha Franklin died.

Again, she did all of this in just over an hour and a half. Luckily, my friends are probably the most patient people in the world, and afterwards found to entire situation to be hilarious (though the surrogate was ready to cut a bitch). They had been hearing stories about her for years, and still can't believe that a single person can be that much of a hot mess.

18,I Had to Go on Vacation to Find a MILITW,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb6047128>,McDuchess,0,18,377,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536071239.0,9cw3ft,"Last week, we were in MA on vacation. Rather than spend a second day sweating through the Freedom Trail in the mid 90's temps, Husband and I drove up to Good Harbor beach in Gloucester. It's gorgeous, BTW. And there, in all her glory, I saw the MILITW.

I was lying on the beach, people watching, when she arrived. Directing her daughter and SIL, along with their adorable little boys, about 1 1/2 and 3, she plowed through the crowd till she found her spot, right at the water's edge. Another woman was sitting just behind where MILITW staked her claim, watching her son in the water. No matter. This was the MIL's territory now. So she took the woman's boogie board, picked it up and moved it so it would no longer encroach on her spot.

Her daughter spent the entire time we were there, smiling anxiously, except when talking to her kids. Then she looked sincere. Son in law, OTOH, spent the entire time as far away from her as humanly possible, scowling. He stopped when, again, interacting with his children, or when his BIL showed up and started treating him like a companion, not a servant. 

I got squicked out when the daughter needed sunscreen on her back, and her mother grabbed it and put it on her, rather than the husband. Daughter had the anxious smile plastered on her face the entire time. 

MIL took charge of the kids as much as she could, although, once FIL showed up, it was clear that both of them preferred him to his wife. The older son, especially, she tried to monopolize, but he was pretty adept at avoiding her and finding one of the other adults to interact with.

During the time we were there, there were no fireworks or theatrics. Just the typically ""I'm in charge of the world"" bullshit we see so often from JNs, and the uncomfortable responses, in varying fashion, from the people who are unfortunate enough to be associated with them. 

Me, I was more than happy to read my Kindle book on my phone, and take surreptitious visual snapshots of the bitch. Sunglasses are so very useful, aren't they?"

I just wanted to start this post off by saying thank you for your advice on the last one. As many of you said, DH does not have to be involved in his Aunt's estate and we are very grateful.

Now onto some llama drama from about a month ago! Language Barrier (LB) has been told by many doctors to lose weight. And every time she refuses, stating that they have a distorted sense of what is healthy. Guys, when she makes stir-fry for her family of 3 so uses 4 clubhouse stir-fry packages. Lawd. This is relevant I promise!

So it turns out that LB became close friends with one of the French secretaries when DH was still a teenager in the hospital. Even better -MIL called her last month to talk. Just to confirm - I am married to DH and he has changed his POA/NOK to me. LB has zero permissions to contact any of his healthcare team. But apparently this secretary wasn't clear on this. So she and LB are talking and then she remembers, oh wait, the doctor asked me to call DH and ask for his current weight (since his bloodwork showed his med levels to be low they wanted to see if it was weight related). So what does this woman do? She asks LB because she can't speak English very well and surely LB would know her own son's weight.

But remember, LB doesn't understand that her normal is actually overweight and such, so she greatly over estimates DH's weight. The secretary writes it down and they both go on their way. At approximately 8 am the next day DH gets a very serious call from his healthcare team. They need to speak with him asap. We are panicking. We know the bloodwork is abnormal. DH calls and they tell him through broken English that his meds need increased immediately. He will need to come to the hospital 6 hours away and be monitored because the increase could cause kidney failure. That is a lot to absorb. But DH is medically saavy and asks them why. They tell him that his medication dosages are not in line with his weight. And then it goes like this:

DH: My weight? I never told you my weight and nobody here was weighed me recently. (saying this while walking over to the bathroom scale to weigh himself)

Receptionist: Yes weight. We got weight on (yesterday) over the phone.

DH: You didn't call me yesterday. You must have somebody else.

Receptionist: No, you are (full DH name and date of birth). 

DH: Yes but nobody has called me or weighed me. What was the weight?

Receptionist: (reads out weight)

DH: well I just weighed myself here and I am (actual weight).

The receptionist proceeded to be confused (bilingual hospital my ass) and had to transfer DH several times. 

Upon hearing this one of DH's doctors became frustrated and called DH. This doctor is mainly English and listened while DH explained what had happened. The doctor then contacted some internal hospital people and they launched an investigation. DH's weight was fine and the bloodwork returned to normal with no intervention thank heavens.

Its been a while and the investigation results just came back. They found the phone number and traced it to LB. The secretary has been fired for a breach in confidentially and DH was sent an official apology. 

Side note: many of you have asked why we don't transfer to an English hospital. We have tried many times. There are none close by. And the French hospital refuses to transfer DH because of the distance thing, but we suspect it is because he is involved in much of their research which = $$$$ for them. We have had friends who work in medicine actually find papers published by the hospital and DH's doctors using his health data (anonymously of course). Also, all his health records are in French and we would have to pay big bucks for them to be translated. 

Update: LB denies it all. She says she would never do anything like that. We have been trying to password protect his healthcare info but apparently French hospital doesn't do that. Any ideas?"
20,This definitely isn’t helping my case with MIL...,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb16acdd8>,queenstower,0,8,68,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536102666.0,9d0q30,"Ughhhhh. 
My mother-in-law has gotten it into her head that her poooooooor son has to do everythiiiiiing in our marriage; breadwinner, child-raiser, maid... while I’m... I don’t know exactly what she thinks I spend all my time doing. I take classes two days a week and I run a very small business (more of a lucrative hobby, except for the frantic two months before Halloween, which is my busiest time of year) when our one-year-old’s naps. 

So recently DH and I have been helping to take care of his elderly maternal grandmother (MIL’s mother), just a couple of days a week. She needs full time care but isn’t comfortable with the idea of going to a senior living facility, so various family members pitch in where we can (but DH is the only one of the nine grandchildren on the schedule consistently, simply because he can work from his computer anywhere and he and I both have experience in senior care). She lives a little over an hour away; we usually stay a few days at a time and have our own room in her house with a pack n play for DD. 

So that’s where DH is right now. Usually I would be with him, but I have a very pressing work deadline and decided to stay home to get that done (I cannOT work at his grandmother’s house; she and DD aren’t on the same schedule at all so it’s constant care for SOMEONE between 7 am and 10 pm, at which point I fall into bed exhausted because I’m also eleven weeks pregnant and TIRED. ALL. THE. TIME.). 

DH ran home last night to get a piece of equipment that he’d forgotten for work and returned this morning. I suggested he take DD with him, since he was planning on coming back tonight anyway. I had to make a trip into town and wanted to take the train/uber to avoid parking, and hauling a car seat and a newly mobile toddler around would slow me down considerably. And DD LOVES her great-grandmother. 

DH reluctantly agreed (he knows it isn’t easy taking care of BOTH Grandma and DD, though he seems to have no problem having ME do it... enjoy a taste of what I’ve been up to lately, darling xoxo). He takes the baby. I go off on my supply run. 

And then I find out that MIL decided to drive up to her mom’s after she gets off work today. **Fuck.** She’s like a dog with a bone, in her notion that DH has to bear an unfaaaair burden in our relationship. I’ve mentioned it in my post history. Doesn’t matter what you TELL her, because that would require listening when other people talk, which is uh. Not my MIL’s strong suit. 

Part of me can’t even bring myself to care anymore— she can think whatever nonsense she wants. But I’m frustrated because DH will correct her, but he never wants to confront her. He insists that it’s better to just correct her when she says something stupid and disregard her “helpful” advice. Basically he just says “Nope, that’s not what happened” and then proceeds to ignore her... which might be the better way to deal with it than open confrontation (they used to have screaming fights when he was a teenager, so I guess he’s come to see any sort of direct conflict as a fight, and therefore ineffective). 

Which is great and all, I guess /s, but it also leaves me feeling like he doesn’t defend me to his mother. He insists that he does. 

I love him dearly but he does tend to be a little dismissive of emotional reactions, probably because of his upbringing with his mother and stepmother. 

But this isn’t /justnoSO; while my SO can be a bonehead, he’s not a justNO. We have a game plan: he’s going to spend MIL’s entire visit talking me UP and singing my praises, and never give her the breathing room for passive aggressive criticism. I trust him to do it, too, if only because his mother’s monologuing annoys him and this gives him a chance to head it off at the pass. And while he might be a little salty that I had him take the baby with him, he’s still got quite a lot to sing about, if I do say so myself ;)

I’m still bracing myself for twenty-seven poorly-spelled texts, later today, because that’s how MIL rolls. I probably won’t respond. I’m still pissed off from her shenanigans at my baby’s birthday party (haven’t posted about that yet) AND the stupid phone call to my DH that she didn’t know I was present for (see bitchbot)."
21,MIL is the Queen Bee & how come I no longer host DH family for holidays meals,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb7394e48>,knitgirlpnw,0,19,49,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536108661.0,9d1gt6,"MIL likes to think she's the Queen Bee. She believes she's in charge of all our lives, homes & jobs.  

When we finally got moved into our house, it was the week of Thanksgiving.  DH had handmade all of the kitchen cabinets (he was making the drawer fronts & cabinet doors too which took him another 9 months) so the kitchen had no doors on anything.  We had been hosting a Thanksgiving dinner for orphan friends for 5 years, it always included my 3 dd's (2 were still in high school & college) & lived with dh & I. The year before we included MIL, BIL & 2DN's  (for the first time, found out they were uncomfortable with our friends & my family) as well as our group of friends.  We had about 25 people coming to dinner. MIL showed up, she sees the kitchen without doors, ""I couldn't have people over with my kitchen not finished"" told her, that's ok I can see everything.  I had asked my dd's to set the table (they knew where the good silverware was) MIL wanted to help. Told her no, the girls had it (they had helped unpack things, so they knew where things were). I asked her to either go into the family room & visit with everyone or go sit at the breakfast table & stay out of my way (I don't like people in my kitchen if I need your help, I'll ask. Something my mom did too, no outsiders in my kitchen & I was raised not to enter someone else kitchen without permission, I still don't go in her or BIL kitchen without their ok) I cooked the entire meal on my own. We sit down to dinner, I start hearing from MIL, BIL & DH (I always fix a ham & turkey) ""gee wouldn't a royal crown of lamb taste great"" come to find out the 3 of them don't like ham or turkey.  I was pissed off. 

The next Thanksgiving, MIL calls me 2 weeks before dinner & tells me ""no one in our family likes turkey or ham"" could you get a royal crown of lamb & instead of asking all your kids, sister (who has had a mild stroke & moved in with us) & all your friends, could it be ""just our family"".  I was taken back by her. No, I'm not going to fix lamb, I've already gotten my turkey & ham. So you want me to uninvited my kids & sister {3 of them live here}? No that's not going to happen. Again all thru dinner I hear from the 3 Stooges "" royal crown lamb"" bullshit again. By the end of the dinner, I'm seeing red. I stand up & tell BIL ""if you want that god damn royal crown lamb so fucking bad, you fucking fix it next year"" & stormed off to my sewing/craft room (because I can lock my door ignore everyone) 

And that's why I only have my family over for holiday meals."

It was my cake day this week. Yay me!. I've blocked Tiararist, but it still goes to voicemail. She left a whiny message wishing me a happy birthday.

So she still has my flipping number! But couldn't use it to actually keep us informed on important news. Which has pissed me off beyond belief. I'm also not thrilled that's she's intruded on my day either. I don't want her birthday wishes, I just want her to leave us alone. "
23,"JUSTNOMOM would prefer to risk my newborn getting the flu and dying, than to risk suffering flu symptoms herself.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfae4db3c8>,oxytocindosin,0,20,32,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536112797.0,9d1yrb,"I wasn’t quite sure where to post this. I posted previously on r/babybumps about the fact that my mom was refusing to get the flu shot before meeting my soon-to-be-born baby (I am currently 34 weeks pregnant). Posted on this sub about how my justnomom is insistent on being in the delivery room (SPOILER ALERT hell no she won’t be) a week or so ago. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion about everything and that includes vaccines; but this is my child who I must protect. I personally believe in vaccinating, and a flu shot is required if you are going to be spending any amount of time with my newborn (especially considering that we’ve now entered flu season).

Long story short, I reminded my mom that she needed a flu shot and tdap in order to meet the baby; she flipped. She has never believed in the flu shot or any vaccinations for that matter. When I started getting the flu shot as an adult, she accused me of being a “poser” (because I work at a healthcare facility that obviously promotes the flu shot) (my mom calls people “posers” to this day because she is apparently eternally 14 years old). But for some reason, she is convinced that the flu shot will give her an adverse reaction due to it possibly interacting with her psoriasis and thyroid medicines (I talked to a pharmacist friend about this and in many years of giving flu shots has never heard of such a thing; I also talked to my midwife about it in length, and she herself thinks my mom is being dramatic and avoiding the shot for selfish reasons.). She claims to have had an “extreme” reaction to the flu shot many years ago, and to that I call bullshit; I remember this time well, and she coincidentally got food poisoning after the shot. It was NOT from the flu shot. And even if it was, is it worth risking the health of an infant? Also, the flu shot is different every year, and if she did have a bad reaction one year, the likelihood of her having the same reaction this year is apparently slim to none. But I digress.

After much arguing (and this is all over text) over a course of days, my mom suddenly switched gears. “Okay! I’ll get it tomorrow”. I replied, “sounds good! Thank you for respecting my wishes. :) Because you were so adamant about being completely against it though, I’m gonna want to see a receipt please!!”. My last comment stemming from the fact that that was way too easy. Also, my mom has a lengthy history of compulsively lying. After I sent that text, radio silence.

The next day, I text her around 7pm asking if she had in fact got the shot. Crickets.

I’m a night owl, so I was still up the following morning at 2am. After talking to my partner, he urged me to send the text I was wanting to, saying, *“Okay, if I were to take as long as you’ve been taking to reply to your texts, I would have gotten at least one “???” text from you by now. Can you answer my question about the mandatory vaccine you need to get in order to meet your granddaughter?”.* 

**90% of the time I don’t reply to her within two hours, she will send multiple texts consisting of question marks and/or threats to call the police to do a “wellness check” on me, etc (note: I’m a grown woman in her twenties with a full time job to suck up my time and often prevent me from instantly answering every single insignificant text I receive). My mom is known to stay up at all hours, and I don’t know anyone who is more attached to their phone. She was blatantly ignoring me. Also, I had a gut feeling she wouldn’t actually get the shot. The following text shows I was right.**

The next day, I woke up to this text from her:
*”I went to sleep early last night, so I only saw your messages this morning...
I never left the house yesterday, so I’m going today. 
I actually find it disrespectful that you are trying to demand a receipt?! 
Seriously? After everything that I’ve done for you-and continue to do-I don’t deserve that kind of rudeness. 
If I tell you going that I’m going to do something,  I’m going to do it. I’ve never given you any reason to doubt that. 
The fact that I was initially apprehensive about the flu shot does not negate the fact that I agreed to get one-for my granddaughters sake. 
I would appreciate it if you would treat me with a bit more kindness and consideration.”*

My reply:
”If you are going to continue to use the things you buy for me and do for me as leverage every time we have an argument or disagreement, I think it’s healthiest that you stop. I don’t know if you notice, but quite often you will say that statement “after all I’ve done for you”, always bring up things you’ve bought or done, any time we have a disagreement. You do it constantly. It makes it clear that your motive for doing these things definitely isn’t solely based in you wanting to help me.

I grew up with you being against the flu shot, I know how against it you have always been. When I told you that getting it was a requirement in order to meet [my baby], this was your reply:

“I’ve told you already, oxytocindosin, that I don’t get the flu shot-ever. 
The only time that I did-I got extremely sick-and it has proven to be safer for me NOT to get one. 
And you know, I rarely even get a cold, let alone, the flu. 
As I said, I will get the tdap shot before [my baby] is born.”

That statement alone is enough to justify my wanting a receipt. Just the fact that you didn’t even consider that the risk to her if she gets sick is death? But you were only thinking of the time you got a flu shot and coincidentally fell ill for a few days? It shows me where your head is (or at least was at the time) and sets off alarm bells in my “new Mom” brain. 

I’m glad that the article (or whatever it was, be it that or my insistence) was enough to sway you, but the fact that you don’t believe that a flu shot is a no brainer (regardless of the fact that I am about to have an infant that you will meet) is still very shocking to me. 

Yes, I want a receipt, and that has nothing to do with disrespecting you, but it does have everything to do with protecting my baby.”

I sent that three days ago, and still no reply from her to that one.

**Whenever I disagree with her on anything (especially when it comes to life decisions for me that don’t require her input whatsoever), she brings up “everything she’s done for me”. From merely keeping me alive during childhood, to the car seat she bought for my baby recently (that I definitely did not ask for and she knew I had planned on buying myself). I DO NOT ask my mom for financial help, because it always comes with a catch. I DO NOT ask her to buy my unborn child things. EVER. EVEREVEREVER. But she continues to do so, so she feels I have a reason to owe her my time and attention. This has always been our dynamic. It is so irritating. Because of course I appreciate the help, but I don’t fucking want it if it’s to be used against me doesn’t the road. From now on, officially, I will decline every time she tries to help me financially or otherwise down the road.**


JESUSSSS. Am I being unreasonable for wanting a receipt??? Like? Really considering going NC with her, because she truly drives me crazy. I love her because she’s my mom, but the more I learn about narcissistic personalities (I’ve done some posting on r/raisedbynarcissists about her after recently realizing she has one of these personalities), the more it’s seeming like the best thing to do is cut her out. At least until she is willing to get help (if I even suggest therapy to her, she’ll say the classic “I don’t need therapy. YOU need therapy” kind of BS). We don’t ever have healthy interactions and she makes my skin crawl. It’s endlessly frustrating and heartbreaking for me, being pregnant and about to become a mom myself."
24,"FoxInLaw's Origin Story, or how I am hiding from Mocha Mix without hiding",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfae4f0748>,FoxInLaw,0,7,52,False,JUSTNOMIL,Munchausen's By Foxy,1536101378.0,9d0k32,"Howdy! My name is FoxInLaw, and I am a survivor of Munchausen's By Proxy. I have long since come to terms with the abuse I suffered under my mother, who I call Mocha Mix because that was her crap of choice to drown her coffee in, she refused to drink coffee without it nor would she use anything else.

So first up, to those who were following my Vacation Log, I am safe and sound and home with JYM again. Mr. Foxy and I got so caught up in each other during the trip I didn't have time to update the log. I'll post how the rest of the visit went later, I promise ♡

Now, looking at a few of the posts today, I decided to tell you guys why I called myself FoxInLaw here.

So, believe it or not, Foxy here isn't all that clever. I use literally two screen names wherever I go on  the Web to make it easier to find me. ~~I also wanna kinda be Internet famous but that's neither here nor there~~

Well, Mocha Mix knows one of these names. And when Foxy was younger, Mocha Mix made me an email account. A yahoo account which had a butchered spelling of the name. I hated this email and was glad to go to Gmail instead because looking at her mangled attempt at spelling it hurt.

The main reason? It wasn't actually my email.

Mocha Mix only made it to keep in contact with me, but she had some stipulations for using it:

* I was not allowed to change the password on it
* Dad was not allowed to have access to it in any way
* I could not give it to ANYONE
* I had to ask her permission to use it on ANY site
* I was not allowed to send messages to anyone except her
* Nor could I delete anything until she read it first
* Any site I signed up on with this, I had to give her access to as well, with the same rules above

As you can see, she is no different from many JustNo's who crave control. I was always scared of trying to do anything with it because she was super strict on how I browsed the web. I was living with Dad at this point (because why else would your Proxy need to be able to communicate online?) but I never thought of the logic involved. I was always afraid of making Mocha Mix mad so I never went beyond Neopets until Dad convinced me sometime later to make a gmail. To this day, I am fairly certain she doesn't know this email, mainly because it spells my name correctly since I made it myself. I had never felt so empowered as I did the day I made my gmail.

Which brings us to FoxInLaw.This subreddit is the only site I use this name, because most things searchable by my normal name are now inactive. 

I'm hiding to an extent, but I'm not living in fear that Mocha Mix will return and try to reign me back in. I'm not gonna let her ruin the one place where I can freely discuss the shit she did to me. I enjoy telling these stories in real life, but I want to be able to talk about it here where I can focus and concentrate on as many details as possible so that I can always remember, and hopefully inspire others on this sub to escape their abusers.

That said, if anyone wants, or even knows my name, I certainly don't mind. 

Vacation Tax!

[This is Figaro](https://imgur.com/qABLfJC). One of the places Mr. Foxy took me to was Kentucky Castle, and at the desk area, they had a bunch of toys on a clothing rack, but this little guy was sitting all by himself in the corner while the other toys were grouped together on the other side. BF and I LOVE dragons and he decided to get him for me. I love this thing to bits, and actually let his head stick out of my backpack the entire trip home."

He was threatening to leave and move back to his former home state and saying he'll leave Chachi for BIL to take care of. That he didn't do anything wrong, that cousins fiancée and i are lying white trash and incorrectly claiming that our fathers abused us.

After he told her off, she then tried to call me.. she then preceded to try and guilt trip him to bring the kids since his grandmother was down (someone who hasn't met  DD because her reaction to finding out I was pregnant was strong gender preference... she also wants me to go out of my way, with three kids to deliver the baby to her.. ha!) That was not happening because after DH went off on her he hasn't returned any of her communications. 

So, laugh at this voicemail with me... 

Hey <op>... its <snag hag>... 
I was just... you know... I want to talk to you... umm.. I'm so much better now, uh... (major silent pause) and I'd just like to try and repair all the messes I've made. 
I'd love to see the kids.. and ya'll.. me and <FIL> both would love to see the children... (pause) and if there is anything... (pause) I could do, or anything to try and repair it pleass let me know... I love you all, byebye

Right in that last sentence, right about the ""anything to try and repair it please let me know"" she goes from moapy the whole way through to sounding annoyed. 

She claimed to DH that FIL sent the text.. but I (and dh) doubts it. 

Kids schools have been notified and locked down. Teachers are aware, not that I even think she would know where DS2 is going, even if she figured out where DS1 is. I officially feel like she sees me as an incubator/hinderence for her grandchildren. 

Holidays are coming up, thanksgiving has been planned since Easter and its our first Christmas in our new house, so plans were to sit tight. We will see how dh's resolve holds. He has been coming out of the fog, the more he acknowledges what he has been taught and triggered the more pissed off at her he is getting. 

Edit: oh, forgot to say.. in the telling off she claims she's on meds for bipolar. I've been a patient with bipolar people before, she's not fucking bipolar. I wonder if she thinks she will garner sympathy with the mental illness thing since she knows I have serious and well medicated depression. "
27,The Weekend From Hell: in which I realize it’s neverending,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb214b940>,dyingdill,0,34,114,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536082345.0,9cxuit,"For background: my SO’s mother and I got stuck alone together for an entire weekend. She brought an endless deluge of awful stuff to decorate SO’s new place, threw out some of my belongings, and has already brought up the prospect of her future grandbabies. By this point in the weekend, i have a constant eye twitch and might just go camp in the middle of the woods instead of staying another night with this woman. 

Anyway, it was blessedly finally Sunday. SO left with his brother at 5 am so he could be home as early as possible and save me. I was calling him every five minutes for updates, and his mom knew he’d be back by four- then she could leave and go the fuck home!!! She needed something from the store before then, and I wanted peace and quiet again, so I lent her my keys. She said she’d get lunch as well. This was at 11, neither of us had breakfast. 30 minutes pass and she hadn’t left yet, and my keys weren’t anywhere I could find them.

I checked up on her, and she was just chilling in the guest room. Cue another monologue when I ask what time she was gonna head to the store, “I’ll be right there I’m just checking my phone just give me five seconds I’m going right now don’t even worry about it Dill” 

Ah, how stupid I am.

I believed her.

Another hour later- but this point it’s almost 1:00 and I’m fucking starving. I hear the shower going though, so I’m pissed but I eat the last snack in the house and figure I’ll ask about where my keys are when she’s dried off.

Finally, at 2:00, I give up and go to grab my keys back and get myself some damn food. There she is- reorganizing SO’s closet, that he arranged exactly how he wanted it before he left on Thursday. 

She sees me and instantly starts another monologue about how she swears she’s going soon she just couldn’t let SO’s closet look such a mess and I need to “keep a better eye on him”. I smile, ignore it, and say “well, I’ve been hungry for several hours now soo I’m going to get food. I don’t want to be starving when SO gets here”

It’s amazing, y’all. Her ass took my keys out of her freaking suitcase and was out of the door in five minutes- she even called me, got my exact order right, and brought the food back in less than 30 minutes. She immediately went back to the store, and was thus gone when SO got home. 

He finally got home, and we agreed she needed to go- the problem is he’s at their mercy at the moment. If he upsets his mom, his dad would stop supporting him- SO would have to stop studying for his big entrance exam, start working full time, and give up his dream of becoming [doctor/lawyer/you get it] because he can’t afford it. 
She gets home, she’s SOOOO excited to see her baaaaaaby and had suuuuuuch a great time with her baaaaaaby’s sweet girlfriend and I quietly gagged in the corner. 

By the time she got back, it was almost sunset. And oh no, she can’t drive in the dark!! Silly her, she’s run out of gas in the middle of the backwoods before and has hopped medians because it’s just too dark- she simply can’t drive at night. She literally GIGGLED and said “oh well, I guess I’ll just stay another night!” SO and I get to unpacking the kitchen together and I just start sobbing. I’ve been on the borderlines of a panic attack all weekend and it’s finally too damn much, she’s constantly talking and in my bubble and making me feel like I’m going insane. I can’t move into my new place for two more days and I just can’t relax with her in the same house as me. SO was really sweet about it and helped me calm down.

Surprise, surprise- SO tries saying we’re busy when I get back from work Monday, she cried and said he was trying to get rid of her. He panics, she stays another night. Rinse and repeat on Tuesday. Isn’t this woman’s husband missing her at this point? It’s been a whole ass week now. Finally, Wednesday during my move-in, she suddenly disappears right when we could use some help carrying boxes! Thus ends her reign of terror- until we can’t find my birth control that night.

It was in the damn bathroom trash can, I’m guessing she thought we’d assume it got lost during the move and idk??? Just risk it??? Smile through the pain when I have an unmedicated period??? 

Regardless, I told SO I would not live with him until we’re self supported and can feel more comfortable in laying down strict boundaries. I also told him that from here on out, I will not be alone with her and will leave wherever we are if she says anything I don’t like. The problem is putting that into practice though- I feel like a limp noodle and get so anxious around domineering people that I’m worried it’s going to take a lot of time and practice. SO and I plan on getting married after I graduate and I don’t want to let this be the rest of my life. 

So, any advice along that vein would be more than welcomed! Also, any nickname suggestions y’all have got... I have more stories I can tell, and I’m sure there’ll be more madness in the long run.

28,"First time mom, MIL can't handle ""no"".",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb16b7390>,GrimJelly,0,156,767,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536045574.0,9ctdh2,"This is my first post here, but I've spent hours reading all your posts! I've also read the rules about a hundred times, to make sure I don't mess anything up and get myself temp banned by accident, so if I do/say something wrong I honestly don't mean to. I'll also try to keep this as organized as I can, but a lot of this jumps around and relates to each other. 

This is also extremely long, and I'm sorry, but stick around if you want to experience my frustrations I have with my MIL. 

I'll preface this with some back story D(ear)F and I have only been together for just over 15 months. We also have a 4 month old son together (scandalous, I know). I met DF at work, we've worked together for going on 5 years, and always had kind of a ""bust your balls"" type of relationship. Keep in mind, that DF is a fairly socially anxious person, and I'm his first serious relationship. We're both in our twenties. I also used to volunteer with his mom, but didn't put two and two together until closer to us developing a romantic relationship. From the very first time I met MIL, volunteering with her, I thought she was a lovely woman. This continued for the first couple of months into our relationship. I now realize that the only reason I thought she was great was because she stayed at arm's length. 

My dad has always been very inclusive of DF. They have very similar interests, and a lot of the time when all of us are together I usually get left out of conversation (because I have no idea what they're talking about and therefore no input), and as annoying as that can get, it's really nice to see Dad being friends with the man I'm marrying. I truly feel like Dad has welcomed DF into the family with open arms. The same cannot be said for MIL. Within the first six months or so of being with DF, Dad had made every attempt to get to know him, be it having dinner with us, inviting him over for movie nights, taking us out to special events. DF even spent Christmas Eve (which is very important to my family) with us and got to partake in our Christmas Morning/day shenanigans. The only dinners I had ever had with the IL's was a birthday dinner for DF and a Christmas Eve dinner before heading to my family's get together. Keep in mind, by the time his birthday had rolled around we had been together for over 5 months. I was invited to one dinner, in a 5 month relationship.

By this point, I felt like his parents weren't being very welcoming of me. MIL was very strict on the ""no spending the night"" rule, even though he was an adult and paid them rent. She would text very late in the night ocassionally, asking when I was going home, when half the time she didn't even realize I was there to begin with. I eventually brought up to DF that I felt like they just didn't want to get to know me, and he responded by saying they just thought I was shy, and that's why I was never invited to come around. I guess that's in part DF's fault, because he could have just as easily said ""is it okay if I bring OP?"", but oh well. Up until this point I really didn't have any real issues with my MIL, other than feeling kind of alienated by her. 

That is until, we discovered I was pregnant VERY early in our relationship. DF, being the upstanding guy that he is, stepped up and immediately started filling his role of ""dad"". He was and continues to be an amazing father to our son. We told Dad fairly early on, shortly after my first sonogram, and he took it really well. I'm a young mom, I'm only 20, so I expected Dad to be disappointed or upset, especially when I had only been with DF for less than 4 months at this point. But he was excited instead! Great! DF decided that he wanted to wait a little while to tell his parents, because he feared they wouldn't take it as well as Dad did. Spoiler alert, he was right. 

Three weeks after we tell Dad, he finally works up the courage to tell his parents. He asks me if he can do it alone, because he doesn't want to subject me to a potential blow up from his mother (this should have been a BIG red flag). He spends several hours anxiously watching TV with them, texting me with promises of ""next commercial break"" when I started getting impatient. Eventually he spills the beans. His dad nervously laughed. His mom went to the sink, accidentally broke a mug, went out to have a smoke, came back in and told him I wasn't welcome around the house for a little while. THIS is where shit hits the fan. 

Over the course of the next couple weeks, MIL has taken it upon herself to try and convince DF that we shouldn't move in together. In her mind, DF should live at home with them, let me either get a place on my own or live with Dad and raise the baby pretty much by myself for the first two years, while DF ""saves money"" and goes to school. DF of course tells her no, but not in a direct enough way, leaving avenues open to try and convince him. She tells him that she would like to have a conversation with me to try and explain to me why moving in together is a bad idea. By this point pregnancy hormones are starting to take affect and I get irritable about this. I say I don't want a conversation, she needs to just accept that we're not doing it her way and comes to terms. Conveniently, a few days later she tells DF that she's changed her mind on the conversation bit, because I'm obviously stuck in my ways. 

Fast forward to October of last year, DF's birthday rolls around. And I'm finally invited to a family outing. I agree to go, as long as DF promises me that I won't be backed into a corner and reprimanded about my life decisions. I'm high stress, we've just had an ultrasound and walked back in the rain. I would like to have a relationship with his parents that don't involve me being treated like a child. He promises me that she's dropped it. We get to his parents' house, and sit down waiting for her to come in from outside. His dad comes in first, and to lighten the mood says ""don't worry, we're just going to have a good meal, no conversation!"". I breathe finally, and then enter MIL. The first thing out of her mouth is ""we need to have a conversation."". She continues to scold me, telling me that I'm not ready for this and I've made a difficult choice for myself, while I sit silently fuming. The rest of dinner goes off without a hitch. I don't see them for a prolonged period of time until Christmas. 

Between October and December, we have our anatomy scan. We find out that we're having a boy, and excitedly announce the gender and his name on our Facebook. A short while later, I find out MIL has taken my sonogram photo and posted it on her Facebook without asking. I'll admit, this bothered me. I feel like this was a very intimate thing for DF and I to share with family and close friends, and that we should have at least been asked. DF wasn't even tagged, so people were commenting asking if it was his or SIL's. I let this slide, and didn't even bring it up to DF because at least she was starting to get on board with being a grandma. 

Shortly after this we find out that there is potentially something wrong with our DS's heart. We had to see a cardiologist for another ultrasound. When DF mentioned this to her, she comforted him, never asking how I was doing, or offering me any kind of support. I truly felt like nothing but an incubator for a grandchild she didn't even want at first. Not long after we had the ultrasound and were told everything was fine she made an offhand remark about how she never had an ultrasounds with SIL and she was fine, and that unnecessary ultrasounds are bad for baby. 

Months go by, and nothing really significant happens. She does some weird things like offering to take pictures while I give birth (she's a terrible photographer and also that's super uncomfortable), getting upset when DF and I make it clear that no one is to be waiting at the hospital for us while I have him, asking to join us to a midwife appointment, and trying to plan a ""grandma shower"" for herself, but all in all the rest of my pregnancy went by without much issue. 

Fast forward to late April, DS is born, and has just been laid on my chest. DF and I spend some time getting to know him, and DF eventually asks if he can text our parents to announce his arrival. I agree as long as he lets everyone know to give us at least an hour before showing up, so we can have some bonding time. IL's show up within ten minutes. So I tell Dad he can go ahead and come see him too. This honestly doesn't bother me a whole bunch, because DS is the first and only grandchild. I understand it's very exciting. Things continue to go well until DS is four weeks old, with weekly visits to IL's. 

Up until this point MIL had made backhanded offers at babysitting, but had never worded it in a way of ""you can feel free to leave him with me if you ever need to"" and instead was always ""oh you just leave him with me. You don't need to take him to do [insert activity here]"". When we expressed that we were going to be taking him to the zoo eventually she added her two cents by saying ""you're not taking him to a zoo. They're awful."" And while I understand her views on them, don't tell me what to do with my own kid. 

When DS turns a month old, we finally let MIL have a crack at babysitting. Being a FTM I was extremely anxious and reluctant to leave my exclusively breastfed baby, so we agreed to let MIL and FIL watch him while DF and I napped upstairs. She asked us to bring our stroller for him, saying it's just to rock him if he gets fussy. I say okay, asking DF to make a note to her that I don't want him going on walks without me yet. We arrive at their house, DF reminds her as I had requested and she immediately gets CBF. 

""Oh, FIL isn't going to be happy. He just wants to take DS for a walk."" 

I reply very politely that I'm not ready yet, and I would prefer him to stay close by me. 

""I would never let anything happen to him!"" 

I meet her with a more solid ""no"". 

Later that evening, after I never ended up napping because I was anxious about her potentially ignoring my boundaries, she asks me if we can take DS to go meet her friend. Now, I'm a pretty easy going person, I like to think. But I just don't see any reason that my son would have to meet his Nana's friend at just a month old. She's a stranger to me, there are germs, and I'm not a fan of passing him around to be held by just whoever. DF agrees before I can say anything, but luckily plans fall through and he doesn't meet this woman. 

This, however, made me realize that she had most likely made plans to take DS to this woman's house while we stayed home, and when I said no and foiled her plans, she got upset and manipulative. The beginning of her second major offence. 

Fast forward another month, we've been told that we need to leave our apartment for two weeks or so while our landlord fixes a pretty major leak. MIL graciously offers us a bedroom, and we take it as Dad's house is small. Before we can leave, we need to move everything from one end of our house to the other end. DF works full-time, so I take on the job mostly by myself. Dad helps me a bit, but eventually has to leave. DS is being particularly difficult, and I'm running out of time, so I ask MIL to come watch him while I power away at it. She asks if she can take him for a walk, I reluctantly agree, as long is it doesn't stray too far out of my neighborhood, and he stays in his seat so he can hopefully nap. She takes him for a half hour walk, and when she gets back I notice his carseat straps aren't in the same spot I buckled him (I'm super anal about this). I ask if she had him out of the seat and she admits she has, claiming she needs her baby snuggles. She says she walked by aforementioned friends house just to show him off, never alluding to the fact that he had been held. She had been reminded on multiple occasions before not to pass DS off to random people, so she was well aware of this rule. Several hours later I'm tagged in a Facebook post of this woman I've never met holding my baby. I, again, let it slide after DF asks me too because I didn't explicitly warn her no visits before hand. 

Now my relationship with her has started to strain. I feel like my boundaries and rules are being thrown out the window as soon as I'm not around to enforce them, and this makes it difficult for me to trust her babysitting. DF convinces me not to bring anything up for his sake.

This is where we come to the big and current issue, and for anyone still reading, thank you very much! 

Recently, I've noticed that people are posting way too many pictures of DS on their social media, myself included. He was set as multiple people's cover and profile pictures, and being shared carelessly. I decided that I wasn't comfortable with this anymore, locked my own social media up very tightly, and asked everyone to please be mindful of their posting habits regarding DS. I shared an infographic about parents and relatives oversharing a child's life and the dangers it could pose, and just asked that everyone keep his safety in mind. I then made a promise to myself to not post him on social media nearly as often (and have mostly kept good on that). Everyone else received this request very well, I got some apologies that I didn't feel were necessary, as I wasn't really angry at anyone. MIL, the main culprit of this, however, ignored it. 

Later that week, we visited the IL's with DS, and I casually bring up over dinner the post I'd shared. I find a way to gently incorporate it into conversation so she doesn't feel like I'm attacking her. I am met with FIL saying ""if you're so scared of social media, you shouldn't be on it to begin with"". Now up until this point FIL is not the one I've had an issue with. He's been a pretty agreeable guy, so this statement throws me for a loop. I explain that I know each and every person on my social media, and that I also know that my privacy settings are very tight. MIL proceeds to throw a miniature fit, giving me attitude about how she has family that she likes to share with. DF is giving me that look, so I let the conversation fizzle out. MIL must have seen this as a surrender, as she pulls her phone out to snap some photos of DS. Fifteen minutes after we leave their house, these pictures are posted. 

At this point I'm irate. There's no other word to explain it. I have made my discomforts clear, asked that MIL be mindful, and was essentially told no, while she did the very thing I had just said no to right in front of me. I give DF a warning that I am no longer biting my tongue, and send her a message. I very politely explain that I'm not happy, that even if it seems silly to her, I am the mother to DS and my rules need to be respected. I offer to speak to her and find a compromise, but that she can't tell me no just because she doesn't agree. She leaves me on read, attempts to call DF, and when he doesn't answer her, messages me back saying along the lines of ""I'm sorry, but you're being ridiculous and I won't listen to you."" She tells me I'm being anxious for no reason and that we need to have a conversation face to face. My blood is now boiling and I can feel the silver tongue coming out, so for the betterment of everyone, I ignore her. The next morning once I've calmed down, I send her another message saying that I didn't think we needed to discuss this further, I was putting my foot down and that was that. 

She leaves me on read and again calls DF demanding he go over so she can grovel about this to him and tell him he needs to talk to me. For the next two weeks this same scenario happens again and again, with DF asking me to reach out and try to talk to her, MIL blatantly ignoring me, and then calling DF crying that I'm being unreasonable. Even SIL sent DF a text stating how disrespectful I was being by telling her no. I tried a total of three times to be polite and respectful and offer a conversation and was ignored each time. DF and I ended up fighting a lot about it, bringing us very close to a break up because he refused to also put his foot down and tell her she needed to listen to me, and instead tried to play a neutral field. In this time MIL continues taking photos from my page and posting them on her own, including works from an aspiring photographer friend of mine, which she had cropped me out of (which aside from just being petty, she had discredited the photographer's work). She tries multiple times to get DF to bring DS over without me, and otherwise just ignores my existence. 

Finally things seem to calm down, DF begs me to forget about it, saying that MIL will be nervous to go against my wishes now because I've made such a stink about this. I changed my settings so she could no longer see any of my posts and agree to go to dinner so she can see DS. A few days after this, I post DS's 4 month sticker photo (yes, I'm that mom) on Instagram.  Within half an hour she has somehow managed to get the picture and post it herself. I'm not sure how as she doesn't have instagram and DF didn't send it to her. My best bet is SIL, who was following me, screenshotted it and sent it to her. 

Now, this probably would not have bothered me IF she had not fought me so hard on the issue before. Throughout this whole thing I've realized that she takes the ""proud grandma"" thing way too far, and is really just using DS as a way to garner attention for herself. I refuse to let my child be a showboat, and obviously I have not gotten through to her, so I message her one last time, this time less than nice. I very bluntly tell her she needs to stop, she's been told multiple times, and this is non negotiable. She flat out tells me I'm being silly and controlling, that I'm too much to handle and that she won't be stopping. That I just need to trust her. I respond with ""how can I trust you if you can't even respect a simple boundary?"" And I'm left on read. She then shares a very obvious post about me on Facebook (keep in mind this is a full grown adult woman), and when I make a comment on it, I am promptly deleted all together. 

Cue more fighting with DF, feeling like I'm on my own in this whole thing, threats of leaving, and he finally sees how serious I am. Agrees to talk to her. He goes for a visit by himself, but the visit is crashed by SIL, so he arranges another visit to clear this up. That was today. 

He sends a text this morning that very clearly states that from now on she doesn't get to say no to me when it involves DS. I need to be listened to, and that is that. He says we'll be coming for a visit today like she wanted, but that there was to be no arguing her case, this was the end of it and she needed to accept that or she would not be seeing DS for a long time. She calls him fighting it. 

During this phone call she manipulates him into making the decision to uninvite me so that they can discuss this further. She tells him she'll be awkward and uncomfortable until this is sorted out and doesn't want to be in that position. No, no. She wants me to not be around so she can try to convince DF that I'm wrong. DF tells me this and says he is taking DS without me. Another fight ensues, because I feel like this is just giving her what she wants. It ends when I agree to let DS go under the pretense that DF promises me that he will be firm and tell her she needs to stop. He was only going to be gone for an hour or so to have a conversation with her. An hour turned into two and a half, with them going out for dinner. 

When DF got home, he promised me everything was done. She had said some things but eventually agreed because she realized she wouldn't get to see DS as frequently. 

I honestly really do not feel like this whole thing is over though and I'm worried about her trying to take legal action against it now. This woman very obviously cannot take no for an answer, and I wouldn't put something like that past her. And at the end of this whole thing, it isn't even about the pictures anymore. It's about the fact that I asked a very simple rule be followed, and it turned into an almost month long battle just because she didn't agree. 

To everyone who reads this whole thing, I really appreciate it! It's been an uphill battle with her and I haven't had many resources to get it off my chest so it feels really good to let all the pent up frustrations out somewhere. 

TL;DR- Crazy MIL is told she isn't allowed to do something regarding DS anymore and throws a month long shit fit about it, pretending I don't exist all while behaving like a child who's had her favorite toy taken away.

So, a little after we move out of her rental house, she fires her son, my DH, from his job at the family business.  Because she can.  She does this thinking that we will be destitute.  We will have to come crawling back!  No, Morlock, you just lost your last bit of leverage.  We were, and still are, financially fine.  Freedom is sweet, y'all.

​

Any time I read a story here that starts out with something to the effect of living under your MIL's roof, I want to shout, ""Ahh! GET OUT!"" as if I could reach the protagonist in a horror movie.  Either that or ""Molly, you in danger, girl"" like Whoopi Goldberg in Ghost."
30,I'm losing my mind,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb4a4b7f0>,antisocialprincess92,0,16,77,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536088077.0,9cypbn,"I have posted previously about my future MIL and how she recently joined Primerica. 

Since then, things have been extremely stressful between me (26/F) and my bf (27/M). From the very beginning I was skeptical and expressed my opinion to her, urging her to reconsider. She rejected everything I had to say and convinced my bf to attend a presentation, and to bring me along. We were lied multiple times by her new boss, who was so clearly a con man who figured out pretty quickly there was no way I was leaving my medical billing job with full benefits for Primerica. He did think he had a shot convincing my bf who is 3 months away from getting his degree to become an accountant that he should throw that dream away and join his mom's ""team"", though. 

Since then, my bf's mom has tried relentlessly to convince my bf that he should work with her. That Primerica is so legit and being an accountant would be a waste of time. That he'll be making 60k a year, which is nothing compared to what he could make at Primerica. That everything we've found online, proving her boss to be a complete liar who has been to court multiple times for wage garnishment, is not what it looks like. That her boss is really a millionaire. 

A week ago she called my bf, saying that he owes her 1500 for money that was gifted to him over a year ago. This was after my bf made the mistake of telling her about the scholarship he'd just received, which would cover the rest of his schooling. She originally said this 1500 was sent from his uncle in Mexico and it was never established that this was a loan before. Ever. But now it is. Supposedly she can't pay her mortgage but my bf's brother who lives with her rent-free knows nothing about that. She was just on a trip to Florida this past weekend for a Primerica conference, which she had to have financed herself, despite being broke and in debt from living off credit for nearly 2 years. 

My bf told her via text that he won't pay her the money until she quits Primerica. That he will help her as long as she is going to make good financial choices. Otherwise she is going to continue needing his financial support that he simply cannot afford to provide regularly. She texted him back, belittling his career dreams and shaming him for not supporting her. Saying she is heartbroken over his words and his skepticisim. That he is not realizing his true potential by going to school for accounting and he is making a mistake by not joining her. 

I was **livid**. I actually started crying when he was telling me what she texted to him. To think a mom could say that to her son, who has been working so hard in college and is so close to graduating....it is bewildering to me. I have a seven year old and can't imagine speaking to my son that way when he is working to achieve his goals that will give him an honest income.  I wanted to call her up and pop off at her but it took everything I had not to. I seriously don't want to see this woman again. I don't want to be around her in any capacity. What she is doing is making me so angry, I can't even fully express the anger I feel. I know that you're not supposed to alienate the person whom you're trying to help out of an MLM/cult but at this point I don't even care. I don't care what happens to her as long as she doesn't think my bf is doing a single thing for her. I feel like a bad person for thinking this way but I can't help it. She crossed the line and has no remorse. 

I can't help but worry that this will tear me and my bf apart. He still gives his mom the benefit of the doubt and says her actions are just a result of the brainwashing her MLM has done to her. As much as I can believe that has had an effect, I don't find that to be enough of an excuse for her numerous attempts to manipulate and shame my bf into allowing her to **scam** him. Family has got to mean more than some ""business opportunity"". 

I doubt this is the end of this craziness. I think she is going to break my bf down so badly that he helps her, and I'm worried. He is clearly hurt by that conversation. Even if he is sticking to his guns about the money right now, I do not doubt she will continue trying to manipulate him. I just want her to go away and stop making this our problem. "

This story has to deal with MIL, SIL, and DD. 

Alittle back story- I have bipolar disorder and have been struggling with depression and manic episodes since I was a teenager but it’s been getting worse since DD was born 2 years ago. With that being said I’m checking myself into a partial hospitalization program today. I set up this appointment on Friday and MIL knew about it. 

I am a stay at home mom who uses MIL for childcare only when I have appointments and she is ok with this. I hate having her watch my daughter because she is to put it nicely, EVIL!!  Well anywho, MIL agreed to watch DD while I go to my intake appointment. 

This morning I text MIL to ask if she wanted to come to my house or if she wanted me to bring DD to her house. She says her house and I agree that’s fine, although I like DD to stay home.  (MIL is a hoarder and her house is busting at the seems with junk) 

About an hour later she calls me. SIL needs to go to the walk in clinic so she won’t be able to watch DD because she has to go with her. I’m thinking SIL broke a limb or something is terribly wrong. Nope, she had a cold sore in her nose. And MIL has to go with? Why WHO THE F KNOWS!!!

Now my SIL is damn near 30.... and she does not go to a single drs appointment without dear MIL.  Some appts I can understand, like for upcoming surgeries or what not. SIL is a healthy and functioning adult. I just don’t get why she has to have dear MIL go with to every. Single. Appointment. She lives with her boyfriend and clams she’s an independent women. 

Anyways back to the story; I kept my mouth shut because MIL is like i said a demon. I don’t want to start a war between the family because there is enough of those. With an hour before my appointment I was scrambling to find a sitter.  Thankfully my dad is on vacation and is willing to take DD for a few hours on a day he was supposed to go boating. 

Sorry for the rant, I am just fuming. This isn’t the first time this has happened either. When I did work MIL would call me 5 mins before she  as due to arrive to watch DD and say SIL needed this or that and she couldn’t watch DD. I have looked into daycares and nanny’s for the those wondering why I didn’t do that. I live in a very rural area with no in home daycares or nannies willing to travel to my small town for the amount I was able to afford.

32,I've finally snapped and I present you all with the tale of The Filthy Hoarder,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb2cf75c0>,Mortuaryfaerie,0,36,49,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536096132.0,9czv3l,"I wrote a really long post detailing the last 4 years of my life that I've spent dealing with this demon but my dang phone crashed while I was writing it. So I'm just going to give a summary and maybe later after work I'll give the details.

To explain her nickname, The Filthy Hoarders house is absolute squaler. Her bathroom floor is rotted out so bad that it's caved in and been replaced by a 2 by 4, there's a pile of rotted food on her table that she keeps  adding to that's probably about 4 ft tall now, 5 foot tall stacks and pils of trash everywhere in her house to the point you have to walk a certain path to go through it, cans full of grease and oil all over the counter, roaches and bugs and all manner of creatures in it.  But she claims my house is disgusting solely because my dog lives inside.

Over the last 4 years she's thrown food on my apartment floor, gone through my medication and belongings, mocked me for being goth, tried for force me to eat pork (I'm Jewish and a pescetarian), belittled me for not having a job immediately upon moving cross country, then tried to force me to quit my job when I got one, mocks me for being infertile, tells me that becoming Christian will cure my infertility,  caused me to have to go to the ER by preventing me from eating for a day and causing my blood sugar to plummet,  would come into my new house and take down things like curtains that I bought and replace them with ratty smelly dirty old ones, leaves trash all over my house, etc.

So yesterday he invited her over for labor day.  It had me so stressed I thought I was having a stroke.  First of all they were supposed to be over by 2 at the latest. When it's 2:45 and they're not there yet I was already sure of the day I was about to have.

They finally show, it's TFH, his nephew B (3 yrs old) and his cousin K (12 years old).  I tell K not to approach my dog yet because my dog is very fearful and shy. TFH immediately pushes K to my dog then flips at me because my dog  growled. I also caught TFH smacking and pushing my dog a few times through the day.  BF was having to hold me back because I genuinely intended to smack the shit out of her for it.  I repeatedly had to correct B because she was letting him run wild, but then she'd tell him not to listen to the ""mean girl"".  At one point I got frustrated because he was standing on my couch with his shoes on (which ended up staining it) and I gently picked him up and removed him from my couch. She FREAKED out and said I was assaulting him. 

So then it came time for food.  We only currently have two chairs at our table so I let her and him have the chairs and told B and K to sit on the floor. TFH then sat on my couch and started eating.  And took her ENTIRE PIECE OF BBQ CHICKEN AND PUT IT ON MY COUCH CUSHION. So I got up and went into the bathroom and told BF I was taking a bath to calm down.  

About a half hour later she comes CHARGING IN TO MY BATHROOM where I'm nude in the tub, and starts lecturing me about how awful I am for about 10 minutes before finally having mercy and getting out of my house"

for background, i’m 19, nonbinary (important because egg donor exclusively calls me by my birthname/deadname), have been living on my own for nearly 6 months, and i’m currently working on trying to survive amidst the emotional/psychological pressure of recovering from abuse. my SO has been wonderful in helping me (including spending a whole night where we stayed up and tried to uncover some dark shit that happened in my past) but my job currently has us long distance which makes today’s events all the more difficult. 

my egg donor has been blocked on my previous phone since about may of this year. my dad has reached out rather inconsistently to talk to me here or there. it’s far from unusual for me to go for a couple months without talking to him, as from around may to the end of july there has been minimal responses. i recently got a new phone. i didn’t tell her or my dad. it’s been exactly three days with this phone. 

i received an email last night that i didn’t see until just now that says:

“(op’s birthname/deadname):

I hope all is well. Your father tells me you are very busy. 

We have been trying to reach you and you are not responding to calls or texts. It looks like some of the texts are not being delivered. First, it worries us when you don't respond, and it causes us to be concerned that something may have happened to you. I would like for us to be able to check on your safety and also contact you in case of an emergency. PLEASE CONTACT US TO LET US KNOW YOU ARE SAFE.  Are you willing to do this?

Also, based on what we see on our account from AT&T it looks like you are no longer using your phone. Again, this causes me to worry and wonder if you are ok. Or, it may indicate that you have your own phone plan and no longer wish to be part of the Family Plan. If this is the case, PLEASE LET US KNOW ASAP.  We will need to update our account. (younger brother) is in need of a phone now because of all the traveling he will be doing with soccer. If you are not using our plan, we will add (younger brother) in your place. 

Finally, if you have a new phone number are you willing to give it to us? Again, I would like to be able to contact you in case of emergency. 

Again, I hope you are safe and well. I am here whenever you are ready to reach out.”

ohhh boy. oh boy. oh boy. 

i don’t even have the proper mental capacity to analyze and respond to every part of this email. my brain has been absolutely fried from work (70+ hours a week/no days off), stresses of moving into a new place (my entire front room is FILLED with boxes), and adding this on top of my already fragile mental state doesn’t exactly help matters. 

i know it appears like she’s just sending a casual email worried about a child, but there’s reasons she got blocked and i packed up and left with someone i didn’t know too well to a city i had never been before in the first place. 

how do i respond? do i respond? i don’t know what to do but i do know i feel sick to my stomach right now. "
34,Previously transphobic MIL is suddenly supportive of Fiance (FtM) shortly after discovering he's pregnant. I have strong doubts.,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb40463c8>,gayapiary,0,47,34,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536101766.0,9d0ltu,"First time posting, made an account for this subreddit. 

My fiance and I are a gay couple, currently staying with MIL due to a perfect storm of inconveniences. It isn't permanent, but we've still got a way to go before moving out. Originally I had booked a hotel to stay at, but after a week, MIL asked Fiance to come stay in his old room. I still spend a large amount of time at the hotel, because I'm still working out of my laptop and working at MIL's house isn't feasible (she acts like the world's most nosy and unwanted secretary, coming in every 15-20 minutes with a brew/wanting to snoop) and all I really need to work is a room with a table, wifi and lockable door.

I don't get along with MIL. She usually flip-flops from tolerable to annoying. Two big points of contention that I'll mention here is that she constantly encourages/demands I call her 'Mum' and let her treat me like the 'son she never had' (MIL has three daughters and desperately wanted boys, according to Fiance), and her transphobic attitude towards Fiance since he came out in his teenage years (constantly deadnaming, misgendering him and making comments framing us as a straight couple). Fiance originally came out to MIL first, as her bemoaning the lack of a son led him to believe she'd be the most supportive. She wasn't. They've had a rocky relationship ever since, going between regular and low contact, largely due to Fiance's very beloved younger, teenage sibling who still lives with MIL. He really wants a normal relationship with MIL, especially as we've started talking more seriously about wedding planning. 

Fiance discovered he was pregnant in MIL's bathroom, and she discovered it more or less immediately after finding the used tests in the trash. He'd been feeling 'off' for a few days and is generally very aware of/sensitive to changes in his body. I wish I could have been there in person  when he found out, but it was during the day, and I was at the hotel, working. We use condoms as Fiance isn't comfortable with hormone-based contraception. We both want children, but any conversations in the past have been about adoption or possibly becoming foster parents, never about conceiving naturally. Fiance has always been slightly paranoid about becoming pregnant, and has never given me the impression it's something he wants to experience for obvious reasons of dysphoria. 

My issue isn't whether or not Fiance decides to keep the child. Financially, we can afford it, and I'll support whatever choice he makes. It's MIL's reaction: she's bloody DELIGHTED. It's like a switch has flipped and she's doting on Fiance constantly, waxing poetically about how younger sibling will be a cute aunt, she'll be a grandmommy, and he'll make a great dad. Yes. A great DAD. She's FINALLY begun respecting his pronouns and gender, and it's making him so fucking happy to see her so supportive and engaged. I'd be right there with him if it wasn't because the switch flipped after he became pregnant. I'm paranoid. I'm skeptical. I can't make myself trust that she's doing this because she's finally come around or because she really, really wants a grandson and Fiance is still in two minds about going through with the pregnancy. She's in his ear a lot as he's staying at her place during the day while I work, and I think it's influencing him more than he wants to admit. 

I want to be supportive. I want to see them have a good relationship. It kills me knowing that Fiance just wants his mum to be proud of her boy. I don't want him to have to bear a child and potentially go through mind-wrecking dysphoria for it to happen. I want him to make the choice for himself, for us. I want our child(ren) to be wanted because we want them, not the bridge that gaps their relationships. I feel terribly guilty and selfish for feeling this way, which is why I haven't spoken to Fiance about this yet.

Clearly, I need to talk to my Fiance one-on-one. This I plan on doing sooner rather than later. Advice on how to approach him with my doubts is welcome. I also worry this is purely me overreacting. That I'm vilifying a mother who is beginning tor realise that she DOES care about her family. If that's the case, please let me have it. 

I guess I'm looking for advice or a bit of perspective.

Thank you for reading."
35,"Guys, Malbots is coming to visit (and more BEC!)",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb6e94e80>,Carbonatite,0,44,91,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536082486.0,9cxvao,"Malbots is coming to visit.  I say this because I need advice,  and also to warn everyone in the Western United States, because while tornado season may be waning, we are about to get an EF5 level twister of sensible $200 loafers and Coach handbags up in here.  DH may need advice too, in case she can't come over the weekend he goes hunting.  He's pretty good at not getting upset by her antics because he finds it difficult to take Malbots seriously, but that doesn't mean he wants to shop for artisanal jewelry with her.

Speaking of advice, thank you all for your suggestions from the last post on addressing ingrained Malbots-induced behaviors like apologizing too much.  There was a ton of awesome advice for both DH and I and it is very, very appreciated.  As was the photoshopped image with stripes added to Malbots's MotB dress.

Things bode pretty well for the most part, Malbots would never stay with us when there are plenty of perfectly good ""economy"" hotels for her like the Hilton.  DH may be able to avoid her entirely if he goes hunting. I love that he would rather be cutting entrails from a dead elk than be around Malbots.  I am currently coming up with neutral things to do, since I doubt she will want to spend much time in our house with [these two derps](http://imgur.com/DqpNE2f).  Malbots thinks all adopted shelter dogs have behavioral problems.  To be fair, the dachshund did poop in my shoes for a few months after I got him, and both dogs have made valiant attempts at killing [this fluffer](http://imgur.com/ddsQpc8) and her ANGERY sister.  But considering Malbots's first dachshund literally sent people to the hospital with his bites, they're pretty good doggos.  As a former shelter worker, I also want to deservedly out her as a horrible human being: She repeatedly tried to make me give our other dog back to the shelter because Malbots thought she would overwhelm the weiner.  We got our dog from a rescue that adopts out dogs at risk for euthanasia.

I imagine Malbots will continue to try to convince me DH is a low class gold digger who thinks ""our family is a cash cow.""  How do I tell her that shit ain't cool without causing a fight? I am ashamed to admit I don't do much to defend my husband from her behind-the-back words.  I know DH gives less than zero fucks about what she says, but I also want to try and curb her constant shit talking.  

I guess my request for advice boils down to three things:

* How to manage her comments and behavior regarding me and DH, and actually stand up for DH for once.

* How to prepare myself for the inevitable anxiety before and during the visit.

* How to look her in the face after excoriating her on the internets and remembering things I'd repressed for years.  Basically, how do I deal with the guilt (not rational, I know) from telling people terrible stories about her on reddit?

Any advice is welcome, since your collective knowledge is gargantuan.  And now, more BEC moments, because I want to focus on ridiculous Malbots behaviors and ideas to make it all less terrifying. 

MALBOTS AND MY HEALTH

My body temperature is low.  It was 96.8 F for years as a kid and now ranges in the low 97s.  So 98.6 is a fever for me, and an actual low fever for most people is not that low for me.

Despite hearing this same thing at my pediatrician appointments for years, she insisted that I was exaggerating and trying to avoid school when the thermometer measured ostensibly-normal-but-actually-sick temperatures.  Bitch, school was an 8 hour break from you.  Anyway, I got sent to school with fevers for years.  

Overshare ahoy!!  Like seriously, I am going to talk about the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome in detail (and how Malbots ignored this until I was in grad school). Skip if you're not into descriptions of gastrointestinal distress.

So yeah, I have IBS and have had symptoms since age 14.  It started in my teens as excruciating pain after eating, generally lasting 3-4 days of hunched over misery as the pain was so bad I had trouble standing up straight.  Malbots said I was being dramatic.  Eventually the psychiatrist she hired as my ""doctor"" (because he straddled the line of HIPPA like a drunk 19 year old on a mechanical bull) was like ""dude, even I believe her, get her worked up for an ulcer.""  It was not an ulcer, ergo, Malbots was right and I was a painfully bloated fakey faker.

This was the way of things for years.  Eventually things got worse. The college health center evaluated me for an ulcer again.

Eventually I said fuck Malbots and her obsession with my malingering.  I was sick and needed a gastroenterologist.  After several cameras in several orifices, the doctor said ""Eh, probably IBS"" and I knew where to go from there.  He emphasized the need for stress control. 

Ironically, Malbots has an autoimmune condition which can cause similar symptoms.  She used to tell me I made it worse when I stressed her out.  It also causes a higher risk of certain cancers.  Let's all take a moment to savor this delectable irony. 

MALBOTS AND TIDY DOORWAYS 

Malbots made everyone remove their shoes at the door and leave them carefully aligned at the edge of the rug by the door.  I don't think this is terrible, taking shoes off at the door=less frequent cleaning.  But Malbots took it to the next level.  

Malbots also had a retainer at the time after having adult braces.  When she talked, she sounded exactly like ~~the nerdy kid who hits on Meg~~ Neil in Family Guy.  It was actually delightful, because it's hard to take verbal abuse seriously when the abuser sounds like an angry 6th grade D&D player.

Anyhoodle, one day my platform flip flops (early 2000s, obvs) had been haphazardly and sinfully left by the door.  Malbots yelled ""Carbonatite, pick up your **schews**!!""  I think there may even have been some angry spittle flying out.  I burst out laughing.  She threw the platform flip flop at my head.

MALBOTS AND *THE HELP*

Malbots ranges from tolerable to traumatizingly embarrassing in her interactions with service workers.  She does this weird wiggly finger wave thing to get servers' attention.  She sends back her wine and medium-well filet mignon about 25% of the time.  She never asks for stuff to be comped.  She doesn't care about money, she's just a dick to people.

On my 23rd birthday, my parents took me to a fancy Indian restaurant.  Malbots ordered something.  The waiter brought the something she ordered.  She claimed she ordered something else, the waiter politely showed her a menu and what she had ordered.  She claimed she ordered something else.  The confused waiter left after a gaslighting/beratement session to make the meal Malbots actually wanted.  She commented on how ""none of these people speak English well"" as he left, while still in earshot.  She made such an ass of herself that my dad added a $200 tip to a $120 bill out of pure humiliation and apology once she sauntered away from the table to the lobby.

MALBOTS AND OUTDOORSINESS

My family's attitude towards outdoor activity ranges from ""I ski occasionally in designer 1990s jackets"" to ""I literally climbed Mount Everest"".  DH and I lean towards the latter, though my current mountaineering status is ""I only lost a chunk of skin from my nose once while ice climbing"".  Malbots has no idea why we do such hazardous things as rock climbing and walking our dogs in dusty dog parks.  I still don't think she believes that my field gear for work includes hard hats, safety vests, steel toed boots, and jeans that only cost $30 covered with nitric acid stains.

Malbots's attitude towards this?  ""My idea of camping is a 3 star hotel with no hair dryer.""  Direct.  Quote.

Edited to add: DH is diligently reading your comments and is leaving his own here and there.  He actually reminded me of some wedding shenanigans I had forgotten in his last comment (previous post, see BitchBot for details). He is a cool dude.

36,Downtrodden Donna and the Big Gulp,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb6e96fd0>,horsesarecool1234,0,7,36,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536100057.0,9d0e3q,"This story is from back when my fucking idiot of an EXH let his mommy (ChickenLady) trot him down to the attorney's office and file for divorce. She accused me of a litany of felonies that I did not commit and they were some straight up ripped-from-the-headlines shit. Needless to say, defending oneself from stuff like that takes a LOT of time and sadly a lot of money. Due to having been basically held captive by ChickenLady and her brood for several years in a new town, I did not have a support system at ALL. 

Cue my JNmom Downtrodden Donna. Donna was positively drooling with excitement when she booked her ticket to come ""help me"" while I sorted through the shit show. Things got off on a typically dysfunctional foot when she arrived and was very depressed that I had not roasted her a fucking chicken, because she had been looking forward to it. I mean, why let a horrendous divorce filing I received 24 hours prior get in the way of my regular cooking schedule, right? She never even mentioned wanting chicken, so this was also another failed attempt at mental telepathy on her part. Anyway, it only got worse and Donna spent countless weeks in my home somehow hijacking the sadness and fear that I was going through and taking it on as her own, all while calling her sisters and complaining about it very loudly. I had no other option but to let her stay, as EXH had left me broke and with no childcare options whatsoever. 

Obviously the longer Donna stayed, and the more of her nauseating passive aggressive garbage I was forced to listen to, the more I had to avoid her. I couldn't afford to go apeshit on my only form of childcare while I was going to a zillion lawyer meetings and emergency coparenting sessions and all sorts of other jazz that the courts make you do when your insane MIL accuses you of full blown crimes you've never heard of before. So, the case progresses and we finally get some dates set for mediation. I had gotten idiot EXH to drop the violent accusations because they were, well, literally made up by a fucking maniac, but the custody situation was getting very contentious. Of course, ChickenLady wanted my kid and raging momma's boy EXH will stop at nothing to make that beast happy, so it was a very scary awful mess at the time. My nerves were absolutely toast.

I tell Donna the dates of the mediation in person and via email. Donna, who is the most anal person ever, has never forgotten the date of any event in the history of the world. Fast forward through several more weeks of me living with Donna's incessant PA bullshit and obnoxious Book Of Faces comments from her harpy sisters that I blow off because I can't start problems with Donna or else I am fucked. A couple of days before I need to go into this mediation to keep custody of my kid, Donna fucking springs this on me... She was leaving the next day to go fly across the country to help my GC sister pack her apartment and move a whopping 10 miles across town, and would not be returning in time to help watch DD while I go through the mediation.  What?! (For the record, GC sister is a normal person in her 30s and totally capable of packing an apartment without her mother) Donna has a laundry-list-sized record of sabotaging my life in the most hideous ways, but I stupidly thought she would never stoop so low as to jeopardize my custody of DD, since she is obsessed with DD. Nope. Donna was leaving and ""Sorry, I'm sure you'll figure SOMETHING out!"" was what her ass thought I would accept as an apology. I remember this moment of my life clear as day, because I have never felt so absolutely abandoned and for some reason it was then that I finally realized my own mom fucking hates me. Donna, as she is telling me this, is behind the wheel of her car in front of my house. Of course she tells me devastating news while in the car, so she can drive away as some sort of asshole punctuation or little bitchy flourish to accentuate how she can just abandon me when she fucking feels like it. Not this time, Donna. I was drinking a huge ass Big Gulp coke at the time, and I snapped. I threw that damn soda so hard at her head that it ERRUPTED all over her face and the inside of her car. I still smile when I think about it. She was obsessed with that car, and apparently it was never quite the same again. Sadly she does not have to deal with the coke splatter anymore because her car got stolen (the tale of Donna's car is another post in itself because she somehow dragged the entire neighborhood into it and caused a very unfortunate racial profiling debacle). This story ends somewhat anti-climactically with me texting Donna to fuck herself and taking whatever stuff she had in my house and throwing it on the porch, only to have her return hours later still soaked in coke to retrieve it while wailing and causing a commotion for the neighbors to leer at.

The next time I saw Donna's busted ass was when I stupidly went to visit \[hometown\] for a while that summer and she stole my fucking blender."
37,Comptroller and Flu Shots,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb6e96978>,razsnazz,0,44,198,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536067438.0,9cvkac,"It's been a while since I've posted here. My MIL is the one who, when left alone for 20 min, ""cleaned"" our house, found mail regarding old financial issues, and told me I needed an intervention. I've been living the life of a stay at home mom since the late spring and cooking this bun in my oven. The summer has been interesting with Comptroller and FIL, but mostly BEC and raging pregnancy hormones. This tale from the weekend, however, has me seeing red and I needed a place to vent. It'll get long because I'm too wordy haha.

Bit of background: Hubs considers himself the lost child while BIL (who is single and childfree) is most definitely the Golden Child. So much so, MIL thinks BIL can't do anything without her ""help"" and ""guidance"" and will bend over backwards to make him happy, even when he doesn't want it. BIL is a nice guy and accepts help when he needs it, but she can't let go of the fact that her nearly 40 year old son is capable of being an adult.

It's no secret here that I'm pregnant, YAY! LO2 is due early November. This means lots of newborn fun for the holiday season but also LO2 will be too little for the flu shot. We typically have huge get togethers for the holidays with friends and family (30 people for Christmas last year), so I have been telling everyone they must have their flu shots if they want to come over for any holiday celebration. Otherwise, they will have to wait until after flu season to meet LO2. We have had some pushback. Hubs' friends have made comments about the shot not working, my brother sounded extremely uncomfortable with being mandated to have a shot, and BIL flat out refused. The ILs and my mom are on board with it.


While visiting Comptroller, she asks if LO1 has had the measles shot. Yes, we are up to date on everything. She starts talking about how bad measles are and what she went through when she caught them as a child which leads to shots in general. I felt this was a good time to remind her that BIL is against the flu shot and we won't be able to do Thanksgiving with him.  FIL had said when we first told them that BIL will just have to miss out, his choice. But Comptroller...does not feel the same. Some points she made plus commentary:

This will be the first year in X years FIL is off for Thanksgiving!  (But BIL works and may not even show up the day of. We usually celebrate with him on his day off, we're not doing that this year because of his no flu shot).

I guess we'll just have to have seperate holidays like we did with Aunt and her family (Aunt is manic, super controlling, and demeaning, thanks for comparing me to her. Hubs said that was absolutely not true. They never celebrated holidays, together or seperate, because Aunt was too busy with other things due to her manic phases).

How can Hubs not see BIL for 6 months?! I don't see that happening! (Hubs responded and said *he* can visit BIL, but BIL can't see LO2. We're not cutting him out of our lives, but he is delaying his introduction to our new squish).

(Also, I would like to note that my own brother has been told he is not allowed over for holiday dinners or to meet LO2 if he does not want to get the flu shot. I made sure to mention that it's both brothers whenever she brought it up so she knows we're not unfairly picking on BIL).

I can't remember the rest, but it was basically guilt tripping us for sticking to No Flu Shot = No Holidays. When we got home, Hubs was mad. Said that this is BIL's choice, not ours, and if she wants to pressure someone, it should be him. We had a very rough first month with LO1's health and nearly ended up in ER because we weren't strict with visitors and I refuse to live that again. We agreed we'd like to host Thanksgiving at our house because we both can see MIL making BIL come over against our wishes and his (he would much rather stay home, but guuuuuilt trips galore will make him come). Plus, it would be beneficial with a few weeks old newborn since we'll have a feeding and sleeping set up whereas Comptroller will not. If we can't, then we will just show up for the eating and head back home since we'll have a newborn that really can't be away from the house too long (babies are wonderful excuses to stay home). And if BIL does show, Hubs said we will leave immediately. I'm confident in our plan to handle the situation, I'm just PISSED she is putting us in it and would rather put the health of our newborn over the comfort of BIL or her image of a Faaaaaaamily holiday dinner.

What should I do?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb2379780>,sammydawn15,0,386,2699,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536016994.0,9cq9ve,"(I posted this a couple days ago in the relationship advice page. Recieved a lot of good advice, but multiple people said I should post here too. Just had to wait until the weekend was over because I havent decided yet if I want to share this with my husband, and I would like to reply to as many comments as I can.) 

Bare with me, as this is my first post and could end up being very long to provide all the info.. now that I've finished typing out the post, it is very long, so sorry! I didnt want to leave anything out 

The incident/backstory:
Back in April of this year, my husband[23], my daughter[2], and myself[23] were visiting with his parents at their house. My in laws went against our request that they not give our daughter Slim Jim's. By the time the conflict started, she had already had 3. I was fed up with them not listening, so I picked up my daughter and demanded to my husband that we leave. He and I exchanged a few words. As I was getting my shoes on, my father-in-law picked up my daughter and walked off into the living room with her. While holding her he started yelling at me. I approached him and demanded that he give me my daughter so I could leave. He refused. I reached out for her and he turned away. Again refusing to give me my child. I reached around him to try to get her. He turned his back to me and kicked me in my lower stomach, so hard it caused me to pee on myself, knowing that I was 16 weeks pregnant at this time. At this point I was completely terrified. I got up and begged them to give me my daughter so I could leave. He handed her to my mother-in-law. I tried to get her from MIL but she was squeezing her so tightly that I was afraid of hurting my daughter if I forced her out of MILs grip. She shoved me back and FIL grabbed me and slung me down into the recliner, then began choking me. My husband pushed him off of me. I got up and grabbed my cell phone, attempting to call 911. FIL hit me in the face and took my cell. I ran into the kitchen to try and use their house phone to call 911. He chased me down and took that phone, destroyed it. I ran back and pled for MIL to give me my daughter. She refused. At this point I saw FIL throw my phone outside into the yard. I went after it to try and find it so I could call the police, but I couldnt. They locked me out of the house. I waited for what felt like forever for my husband to finally come out with my daughter. We left. I called the police. DVPs were filed, and charges pressed. 

Fast forward to now, I ended up agreeing to drop dvps and charges because they had charges filed on us too and said if I dropped mine they would drop theirs. (Small town-they had every in with the justice system in their county). There were many reasons I agreed to drop everything, the expenses of legal aid, the mental toll, the endless stress it would have caused me during my already high-risk pregnancy, and my main reasoning to protect my husband from possibly having domestic battery conviction, although he did nothing, his mother had him arrested.  I agreed to drop the charges under the promise and understanding from my husband that our family was going to cut ties with my in-laws and I would not have to worry about myself or my children being around them ever again. 

It's been about four months since this happened and only about one month since all the legal processes concluded. I'm currently 36 healthy weeks pregnant with my second daughter. My 2 year old has seeming recovered from the trauma pretty well, but still has obvious anxieties over loud talking or physical contact-even play fighting. 

The problem at hand:
Recently my husband has begun speaking to his parents again and visiting them as well. They are sending gifts for my children and offering help with groceries, bills, etc. Even though it's not what we agreed on, I've tried to be as understanding as I can be because they are his parents. So we fought and fought over it, and I finally agreed that yes he could speak to them if that was what he needed to get us to a point where it wasnt going to ruin our marriage. A week or two passes and we start to fight over our children being around them. I dont think they deserve to have my children in their lives ever. He wants our girls to have a significant relationship with them. Eventually I agree that yes IN TIME, and I specified that it would not be within the next year, as I need time to heal from what happened, I would allow our daughters to spend time with them in public settings only, never in their private home, under my supervision. This was agreed upon. Another short amount of time has passed by and hes already asking to take our 2 year old to their house to visit them. Hes made comments about taking our yet to be born daughter to see them too.

What I need help/advice with:
I've given as much as I can mentally handle, any more and it would be completely unfair to what I need and what I think is best for our children and their safety.. So I've refused to budge anymore. Though things are at a cooldown phase right now, I'm afraid that this will eventually turn into another month of misery and fighting or longer because I just can not give in anymore. I dont want to lose my husband.. I dont want my marriage to fall apart because I wont give in to what he wants again. Is there anything I could do to make this work? Is there any way I can show him that I've done enough? How can I fix this? Is there a way I can protect my children from these people and save my marriage? Am I in the wrong? Have I done enough? 

Thanks to anyone who has made it through the whole post. Any and all advice or input is welcomed, rather you agree with me or not. I just want to understand what I need to do or what I could do to make this easier on my family and still keep my children safe. I dont really have anyone to talk to about this. Thanks for listening!

39,Partner fencesitting over in laws poor behaviour,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb3a55208>,sickofinlawscrap,0,19,21,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536107368.0,9d1b5m,"TL;DR: My partner told me ""I will never choose between you and my parents"", after his parents' disrepect towards me and him came to a head. How on earth do I move past this?

Preface: my partner's parents and controlling demeaning people who treat their adult children like toddlers who can't make their own decisions. It's frustrating to watch my partner be treated like a naughty schoolboy and not the man he is.

Three weeks ago, me and my partner went out for dinner on a Sunday night with his family for his brother's birthday. Over the course of the evening, his brother questioned whether or not I could get another high paying job if I got made redundant, his father started looking up jobs for me to apply to and had to ask me what my job was again (I've had the same job for 2 whole years), and his father and mother started making detailed holiday plans (down to how my partner will access the internet to study?!?!?) for the four of us to go to a wine region, after I explicitly said ""let us know the dates and we'll check"".


The single most demeaning part of the evening was when we discovered we would have to leave earlier than we thought - there was road closures meaning our bus route home was cancelled. We got different bus home, and the bus stopped running quite early (it's a Sunday). We discovered this at the dinner table after we brought up how the road closures were inconvenient. Bear in mind - everyone had finished eating by this point. When we told them we would actually need to leave in about 20 mins the mood soured. His mother told us it was fine, then when we actually left she cold shouldered us and could barely make eye contact as I thanked her for dinner. His father just told us to get an uber home (I don't use uber and he knows this) and then wouldn't talk to us after I declined to use uber. On the way half me partner bemoaned how there was never any pleasing them. It's not like we closed the road on purpose! It was out of our control!!


The next day, I told him how this and the dozens of other incidents like it over the past 5 years really hurt me. I hate being disrespected and their constant condescension and belittling of his and my choices is draining. After that conversation, he had a private telephone conversation with his parents. Whilst he says he defended me in that conversation, the key takeaways were I am too aggressive in conversation, I am too quiet in conversation (🤔🤔🤔), I am too controlling of him and boss him around, and they feel I don't like them. My partner then asked if I could commit to being less aggressive in conversation (I did get on an anti-uber rant at dinner) which I agreed too. He pleaded with me to try hard, and make it work. I said I was willing to try if they are willing to try. He said ok.


Last night, I brought the conversation back up. Upon really thinking about it, I was a bit miffed that I had committed to change a specific behaviour and they had not. I told this to him, that I don't think it's fair I have to change myself to please them and they will not change any specific behaviour, and will in all likelihood continue to be disrepectful. I also told him that I was dreading seeing them this weekend because of this. He was angry I was bringing this back up because it was already settled, said that they will get better, and to not bother coming to his grandfather's birthday this weekend if that's how I really feel. I told him ""why won't you take my side on this?"" And he said he will never choose between me and his family.

I went and had a cry by myself after that, and we haven't spoken since. I'm absolutely shattered, my trust in him to do right by me is gone. What if something more serious came up? Would he still not choose aka choose them? How on earth do I get past this. And advice appreciated. Thanks."
40,Tsarina and Seniority,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb12e3128>,partyontheobjective,0,5,19,False,JUSTNOMIL,Monkeys do her dirty work. ,1536106533.0,9d17ei,"So Sunday morning BF and I were enjoying some huevos rancheros. Suddenly Tsarina bursts out in a paranoid rant against North (BEST! j/k) Korea hackers and how badass they are. She was watching some fear mongering pseudo-science show. Now BF actually works IT. Him and me are... a bit into the scene. Needless to say, we know about the thing more than Tsarina.

Now, as I previously mentioned, Tsarina is everything-phobic, but she really dislikes Americans, declaring them all stupid morons who don't know shit. Her words not mine. Apparently, there's a caveat to this. I'm getting there.

So BF took the bait and engaged in the discussion. What happened was, we, but mostly BF, bc she just immediately tries to shoot down everything I say, which just ends with me cackling and walking away, tries to explain to her about how North Korea works, esp regarding nuclear weapons, and hacking. She just doesn't get it. She finally shuts BF up by yelling, ""Shut up, there were some American scientists on the show here and they said so, they're smarter than you!""

BF just shakes his head and decides not to engage in a conversation like this. See, when you engage with a dumdum like Tsarina, they'll drag you to your level and beat you with experience. He opts out.

A couple of minutes pass in silence and huevos rancheros, and I finally crack. In a stage whisper, I tell my BF, ""See? Those damn yanks, morons and retards, the lot of them! Except for those yank scientists on TV, those are always right!""

HO-LEEE SHIIIIIET! Another Tsarina tantrum, 9 out of 10, would defy her worldview and logic again.

She howls like a banshee. ""YOU LITTLE SHIIIIIIIIITSSSSSSS!!!!"" Oh shit, death is encroaching over the household. ""I'M OLDER THAN YOUUUUUUUU!!!!"" Ben síde sat on the roof of our house. ""YOU HAVE  NO EXPERIENCE!!!! NO SKILLS! NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD!!!!!"" 

For a moment there, we both thought she's yelling at the TV, which started to proclaim some wild ideas. BF calmly asks, 'I'm sorry, is that to us or the TV?""

""YOOOOOOUUUUU!!!!"" Fuck banshee, she's la Llorona. She slithers to the floor and proceeds to pound her fists against her stupid white leather couch. ""I KNOW MORE THAN YOUUUUUUU!!!! HOW DARE YOU QUESTION MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!"" she points to me. ""MONSTERRRR!!!! HOW DARE YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!"" she kicks the table, which topples over her coffee cup. [Reminded me of Cartman that one time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbebjUYItKw).

We were done at that point. We cleaned up after ourselves only, not minding her tantrum, and legged it to my part of the house. We're still giggling over it, reminding ourselves the times she claimed erosion, time zones, and gravity were only theories yet to be proven.

Next time on Tsarina believes Ancient Aliens: Earth is flat.

Not really. I don't *believe* she's one of those yet, but she does question the moon landing, calling the Mythbusters episode that debunked the moon landing hoax theory a hoax in on itself."
41,Step On Me's Emergency Mattress,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb6ea4a58>,kitethekite,0,26,54,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536087380.0,9cylks,"BF and I work 9-5 jobs so we typically go to sleep around 10pm, wake up around 6am. His mother knows this.

We wake up on Sunday morning to multiple missed calls from her around 11pm-midnight. Plus, a text from BF's brother saying ""kitethekite tell BF to check his phone. BF, call our mother"". Our phones are usually kept on silent, so nothing woke us up. We saw all this first thing in the morning and started to panic, thinking someone died.

We finally get in touch with her and what did she want? Who died? Whose car was totaled? What's the emergency? Oh, she just wanted her son to order a mattress online - not for her, but for her friend.

Not only is it crazy that she couldn't leave a text/voicemail saying ""hi, whenever you get a chance, call me, I need you to help me order something"", but it's INSANE that she then got mad at us. 

She was angry we were sleeping (at 11pm/12am) and not available to take her calls. She was angry we leave our phones on silent. She then slid into being angry about the fact that the two of us even HAVE phones in the first place, since, you know, the only people we ever talk to is each other... typical baby-boomer-mad-at-millennials-and-their-darn-technologies stuff.

Just needed to rant. Thanks."

Womb Landlord (WL henceforth because jesus, descriptive or no that moniker is way too long to type a bunch of times) raised me to be her emotional toilet. I had no idea this wasn't how things worked for everyone - I remember reading one of those schlocky Chicken Soup for the Soul books and seeing a story about how this woman's mother was her best friend now that she was an adult and just thinking ""how?"" Because I was seven, and my mother was telling me about how we might not make it home because she only had the pennies in the cupholder for gas.

I turned the heat in the car off, on a very cold night, for which I was completely inappropriately dressed, because I was afraid we wouldn't make it home.

I.

Was.

*Seven.*

It never got better. She told me about how she had to kick my father in the balls for... some reason. When I turned nine, after they'd broken up, I jokingly said I wanted a younger sibling.

Next morning, she told me they'd had sex because of it. And expected me to be grateful. Because I said I wanted a sibling.

I was nine.

We moved to a new place that my grandmother bought when I was eleven.

She kept me up til 4 AM wallpapering.

And then later because she was using my laptop.

Which was mine. Except when she wanted it.

At three AM.

I was eleven.

43,"MIL and abusive ex used to despise each other, now they’re besties",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb12e3710>,patheticandsad,0,13,25,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536101367.0,9d0k1k,"I recently left my abusive husband of 11 years.  I FINALLY reported the most recent incident to police and he’s since been charged with 3 counts of assault.   His mom had to bail him out and I imagine she was not happy about that.  

These two have always had a shit relationship. They were always nasty to each other.  Condescending , rude, backstabbing, grudge holding assholes.  He would complain to me that she treated him like garbage as a kid. his sister was the golden child and he was the black sheep.  

She once told him she couldn’t stand to look at his face because he reminded her of his father (who left her for another woman 20 years ago). 
I had to force my ex to visit her out of respect.   
She refused to help with our kids - my mom being the only one to offer babysitting or any support. 

Now that I’ve left, there’s a restraining order against him and we can not communicate other than through a third party. She’s taken this as a means to control the situation. She’s asked why I stayed if it was ‘that bad’ with a sarcastic smirk on her face.  She also basically prevented me from taking my things from OUR home - she stood over me while I leafed through my personal documents, stating I shouldn’t remove anything from the home “ under the circumstances “.  

I got so upset I just left without finishing - I threw my own clothes on the front lawn. Just to get the fuck out of there. Out of my OWN house that I’ve owned 5 years. I felt like a trespasser.  And the look she gave me when I was frantically trying to get my shit out as quickly as possible - is the same look he used to give me.  It’s a look that says “ you deserve this pain; I’m better than you”. It’s like there is nothing in there - no human emotion.  Two peas in a pod, yet they’ve spent most of their lives hating and resenting each other’s existence. 

I finally see it now - they are the exact same person.    Misery loves company, and they both love to be miserable!

Thanks for reading my drama

44,My MIL used to be my friend. Now she’s chosen an alcoholic creep over her family and we had to go NC.,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfac33a7f0>,SunnyTheGinger,0,18,62,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536083753.0,9cy2ir,"I’ve been lurking on this sub for a long time thinking about how my own MIL is not the greatest, but normally doesn’t even come close in comparison to some of the monsters-in-law I’ve read about here. Over the last year though, she has become a source of immense stress not only for DH and I, but DH’s whole family. And I wasn’t going to make a post on here (because I genuinely think she could be much worse), but I recently went NC with her and I think it warrants a post-if not to satisfy your llamas, then to at least allow me to vent to some internet strangers. Also, sorry about some weird formatting. I’m on mobile. 

My MIL and I used to be really close. She displayed some behavior early on that should have raised some red flags, and we can get to that another time, but nothing seemed too out of the ordinary. We had a pretty normal, friendly relationship for the first 2 of my marriage. Fast forward to this past year and things are completely different. I went NC with her about a month ago and here’s why:

MIL got with this guy about a year ago. I’ll refer to him as MIL’s bf. DH and I disliked him from the start. This guy is a total loser and quite the alcoholic. He’s also downright rude and disrespectful. And creepy. He makes my skin crawl. At first I couldn’t even pinpoint why he made me so uncomfortable. I just got super negative vibes from him. I want to highlight some of the things MIL’s bf has done to give you all a general sense of how awful this guy is:

-He is an alcoholic and would literally rather spend his last dime on beer than food. My GMIL (MIL’s mom) typically has all the family gatherings at her house and banned him from drinking there. So instead, he hides his alcohol in MIL’s truck and goes out to the truck to drink while he’s at GMIL’s house. 

-Speaking of GMIL, he once tried to trip her and claimed it was just a prank. Tripping an elderly woman on purpose is cruel, not just some dumb prank. 

-My SIL’s fiancée (I’ll call her SILf) and I were pregnant at the same time. MIL’s bf always made stupid, creepy jokes about them being lesbians and inquired how one of them was pregnant, like it’s any of his business. My SILf has a nice shiny spine and doesn’t hesitate to tell him  to mind his own business. I guess he took that as an affront and started calling her fat any time he saw her. He never dared call me fat. I think he knows DH would crush him. 

-He and MIL were babysitting my SIL’s children and he told the youngest at the time (baby wasn’t born yet), a 3 yo girl, to go kiss the neighbor boy on the lips. He photographed the whole ordeal and sent the pictures to SILf. SILf was PISSED. 

-Another babysitting story. My SIL and SILf have 4 kids total. MIL and her bf  we’re babysitting the older 3 overnight (again, before the 4th was born). He slept in the same bed as all three kids, in his underwear, and took pictures of himself lying in bed with them. The pictures made me sick. They don’t babysit anymore. 

Those are just some of the main points about him to give you a general idea of what he’s like. He’s also a total mooch, doesn’t have a job or a car, is constantly asking for money that he just spends on beer, and he’s lazy. No one likes him. He’s just a rude, creepy loser and my MIL has gone downhill fast since they got together. And MIL keeps trying to force us to accept him as part of the family! When they got engaged she told DH, “ He is going to be your step father and you need to accept that.” Like, no bitch. He’ll never be part of the family. He’ll just be your dumb, creepy, alcoholic husband. 

And I have a suspicion that he is trying to turn MIL against DH and I because she has had a really shitty attitude towards both of us. For instance, MIL bitches to GMIL about me “being meeaan to heeeerr” and she “just wants her DIL baaaack” and she “doesn’t understaaaand why SunnyTheGinger has chaaaanged.” Like, she for real complained about my son’s name. DS is named after my FIL, and I guess she doesn’t like that. So instead of calling him by his actual name, because it’s sooooo hard for her to say her ex husband’s name, she started calling DS by his initials. I politely told her we’re not giving DS any nicknames and I’d prefer it if she called him by his actual first name. Her response was, “Well [DH] says I can call him by his initials.” I called her out on her lie (because DH and I had literally talked about the issue not even twenty minutes beforehand and I knew he didn’t like it either) and she went and told GMIL I snapped at her and wouldn’t let her give her grandbaby a nickname. Like, bitch. You don’t want to give him a nickname. You just don’t want him to have my FIL’s name! And for the record, she’s seen her graaaandbaaaaby twice since he’s been born. She’s had other opportunities but blew them off to hang out with her bf because DH and I won’t allow him near our son. I don’t even like MIL being near DS because she’s a heavy smoker and refuses to shower or wear smoke-free clothes before seeing him. She says “oh I forgot to bring clean clothes. I’ll just put on my jacket,” which, by the way, is also saturated with cigarette smoke. And then she complains when I won’t let her hold DS. Third-hand smoke is a thing, lady! “But I don’t ever get to seeee hiiiiimm!” Too. Damn. Bad. DS doesn’t even like her. He cries around her. 

When DH showed MIL his shiny spine and told her how shitty she had been since getting together with her bf her response was a curt, cold, “Well I guess I don’t have a son anymore.” She should have been apologizing for her behavior and here she was getting defensive and trying to make DH the bad guy. DH tried to brush it off, but I could tell it hurt him. She still hasn’t apologized. 

There have been other things my MIL has done here and there that have been building up for a long time, and I might talk about them at a later time. For now I’ll stick with the series of incidents that led to me cutting her out of my life. 

I want to preface with the fact that MIL asks for money and favors A LOT. DH and I stopped giving it to her long ago, but the point I’m trying to make is that she needs help from family a lot and she always gets it one way or another, despite her being shitty to everyone. This woman literally never thanks anyone or returns the favor. But DH’s family has always supported her when she needs it because they’re all good people. If MIL didn’t look just like GMIL and GFIL I’d swear she was found abandoned in a ditch somewhere. 

About 2 months ago I got a phone call from SIL to tell me that MIL left her bf after an argument they had ended with him threatening to burn down their home. I thought “yes, finally, maybe she has seen the light and is going to leave this asshole.” And I was actually concerned so I called MIL to make sure she was okay. She explained that he was drunk and yelled at her but never hit her and it was just a one time thing blah blah blah. I gave her some tough love and said, “Look, this is how it starts. He has shown you his true colors and this is the beginning of a long string of violent outbursts that will end with you getting hurt. You have to stay away from him. Any chance of redemption between your bf and DH and I had been lost forever. There’s no coming back from this; please be done.” She responded, “I think I will be done, but part of me wants to give him another chance. He hasn’t done this before. He didn’t know what he was doing and he doesn’t even remember it. But I’d never choose him over my children if that’s what it comes down to.” I told her if she goes back to him she’s literally choosing him over her kids and hung up. They were back together the next day. 

Fast forward a couple weeks and it happens again, go figure. This time must have been worse because their neighbor actually came over to see if my MIL was in danger. GMIL spent $300 to help her move her stuff out and gave MIL her spare bedroom on the condition that MIL had to leave for real this time. I called MIL and got no answer. I guess she didn’t want another dose of my tough love. Oh well. Didn’t really want to talk to her anyway. Two days later MIL said “fuck you” to the whole family and moved back in with her bf. 

I blocked her on everything as soon as I found out. I blocked her number, Facebook, Snapchat, everything. Part of me feels bad because I’ve been in an abusive relationship and I know it’s hard to leave. I try to tell that part of me to STFU. I’m over her drama. I’m over her taking advantage of good people and then screwing them over. I’m tired of her reckless, disrespectful, entitled attitude. I don’t want her near my child. There’s a slim chance I’ll ever talk to her again. DH hasn’t talked to her either, but he’s reluctant to block her because she has some health issues (which she’s lied about in the past, so who even knows if they’re real?) He agrees with me keeping our son away from her though. At this point I’m not going to make DH block her unless she does something bad directly to us or DS. It’s been about 6 weeks and she either hasn’t noticed or doesn’t care that I blocked her on everything. It seems unlikely, but I actually think she might not know because she’d bitch about it to GMIL as soon as she figured it out and so far GMIL hasn’t inquired about it. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I needed to vent. 

Oh! Before I finish this post, I want to add that just a week ago, I found out she has been lying to me for YEARS about something pretty serious. In a nut shell, FIL went to prison for a little while. He fucked up and paid the price for it, but he’s not a bad guy. He’s one of the most genuinely good and honest people I’ve ever met and I’m glad to have him in our lives. MIL lied to me about the reason he went to prison and I’m very angry about it. She made his crime sound so much worse than it actually was. She made some very serious accusations (some of which I knew weren’t true, but I stupidly believed the rest) and I wish she had to pay for that. I want to confront her and tell her I know about her lies, but then I remember keeping NC is more important. The worst part of it is she continues to ask FIL for money. And he gives it to her because his heart is made of gold. I just wish his spine was made of silver. We’ll have to work on that lol"

46,We buried a toxic person today,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfacd081d0>,phytoarch,0,5,12,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536117721.0,9d2l4b,"Well my toxic JNgrandma finally died and we had the dog and pony show (her funeral) today.  I expected from the beginning that it would be a (excuse my language) shit show.  It seems that being dead hasn't stopped her screwing with us (Surprise surprise). 

&#x200B;

Before I get to the meat of this story I should share some family history first.  We all hate each other and have been feuding for decades.  Most of the issues each of us have with each other stems from toxic grandmas lies, triangulation and gaslighting.  She loved pitting her kids against each other to see who loved her the most.  She made up outrageous lies, was emotionally abusive and always acted the victim.  Grandma has four kids, Uncle 1 and 2, JNdad and Aunt 1.  All of them have, on occasion, been NC with her.  Uncle 1 spend most of his life being either NC or LC with her.  Aunt 1 was NC with her for over ten years and then more than a year on two later occasions.  JNdad and uncle 2 was NC with her for almost ten years. Before becoming ill Grandma was NC with Aunt 1.  After being diagnosed all her kids became full contact, although none of them were talking to each other at all.  

&#x200B;

When she died all her kids called a temporary truce to plan the funeral together and everyone acted civil throughout he ceremony.  Of course since the entire family is JN things were pretty weird.  DH and I got there early and were immediately accosted by an army of old crones (aka grandma's geriatric FM's).  Since they haven't seen me since I was a toddler they have no idea who I am and they immediately assumed that DH is the 'family'.  It was hilarious.  They got right up in his face and demanded to know how he was related to grandma and what he was doing there.  DH looked like a scared deer in the headlights and I literally had to swoop in and save him.  

&#x200B;

Then we got to got to deal with some verbal abuse (aka jokes and compliments) from my JN cousins. They are all BEC aged beauty queens and happily commented on how old I look (eyeroll cause I'm years younger than them and look it). Of course just as I thought it couldn't get worse Food Thief (my JNmom) showed up (sigh).  She swooped in and decided to 'introduce' me to family friends and relatives (most of whom I don't know thanks to feuds).  She was damn rude the entire time.  At one point she dragged me to a family friend and went: ""OP this is \[family friend\].  Do you remember her? She's the one with the retard kid.""  She said this while standing next to the poor woman and I wanted to die of shame (the woman's kid is mentally and physically disabled). 

&#x200B;

Finally everyone is told to go inside for the service and I'm told to wait outside cause I'm supposed to help carry the coffin.  There is only one problem.  Nobody knows where grandma is.  Guys the old woman showed up half an hour late to her own funeral in the heaviest coffin that money could buy.  We finally heave her inside and the fun starts.  Some verses from Mark were chosen (by grandma) for the funeral sermon.   It read "" Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing to me. The poor you will always have with you,and you can help them any time you want. But you will not always have me. She did what she could.... ""

&#x200B;

The pastor spun a happy story about how good grandma was and how she did everything she could for her family.  It was ridiculous and one last, very obvious, guilt trip.  I happily made my own version of the sermon that used the same verses ""Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing to me."" (She's the victim don't you know.  Everything she did was perfect and wonderful (sarcasm).  ""The poor you will always have with you,and you can help them any time you want. But you will not always have me. "" (Focus on me.  I'm the most important person.  How dare you have a life of your own?) ""She did what she could.... "" (...to us.  She did what she could to us. She destroyed everything she touched, including her family.)

&#x200B;

I'll admit several people got a bit misty and sad during the funeral (I blame it on the guilt trip music).  Well all sadness went away when her will was read directly after the service.  She left everything to (drum roll please) FM aunt 1.  And I mean everything.  Her other kids didn't so much as get a sentimental photo or a token item that said mommy loves you.  She left them nothing at all, which off course has sparked a whole new feud and everyone has gone back to NC. Thanks so much for the weaponized will grandma.

&#x200B;

I should note here that I wasn't there for the reading (cool brother told me what was said later), I was outside being harassed by one of Food Thiefs FM's.  Guys she got right in my face, not two minutes after we left the church, to hiss at me about how rude and disrespectful I was towards Food Thief.  My sin? A few weeks back Food Thief tried to come over uninvited.  She called me when she was almost at my place and demanded a visit.  I told her I wasn't home and reminded her that she needed to call ahead of time to organize a visit and she couldn't just show up when it pleased her. 

&#x200B;

Well Food Thief's FM went off on me about how rude it was to say that to my mother and how much I'd hurt her feelings.  She went on and on about how lonely my mom was and how she just wanted to see me.  She told me I was inconsiderate.  When I pointed out how inconsiderate Food Thief's behavior was she told me Food Thief didn't mean to be inconsiderate.  She flat out told me that Food Thief was an impulsive person and I should accept that.  ""Its just how she is."" FM kept saying.  Then she tried to guilt me into having Food Thief over to my place the next day to make up for my behavior.  I shut that down very fast and told her that I wasn't unreasonable for wanting some advanced notice before Food thief just showed up.

&#x200B;

Where was Food Thief during this convo?  She was silently standing next to her FM looking sad.  She heard everything said but was happy to let FM speak for her while she looked sad.  After the convo I dragged DH away to leave.  

&#x200B;

One good thing did come from the funeral.  I finally found out which of grandma's flying monkeys were messaging me pretending to be her.  It was FM aunt 1 who inherited everything.  I've now blocked her.  NC sweet NC.

&#x200B;

Ps.  I banned DH from telling Beelzebaby about grandma dying or the funeral.  I didn't feel like consoling a crying Beelzebaby this time (see BB for story about Beelzebaby and how she handled previous deaths in my family)."
47,Introducing ... my GMIL in “Adventures in Caretaking” Long long long,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb2b93940>,cityvengeance,0,12,68,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536080001.0,9cxh40,"As a preface, I’ve been with my husband for almost three years now. We have one child together, both of us have fairly large families. Everyone is fairly okay, some are better than others. Except for his mothers side, the controlling and incontinent matriarch is his grandmother, who is a total JustNo. She rules from her lift chair, when she isn’t busy asking everybody to live her life for her. 

This woman has pretty much always had it easy. Came from a well-off family, has no idea about money to the point of her having a double-mortgage on a house that shouldn’t have one. She will however only spend money for new items for herself. She gives out weird shit from her hoard that is obviously used or bought from a flea market. (But she expects beautiful new things herself. 🙄) She is a Good Catholic with a penchant for indoctrination. She loves to gossip about anybody and anything. 

GMIL has no concept of appropriate behavior. Upon asking her to please not be naked in front of my husband, even if she is somewhat covered, she promptly burst into tears and told me I was “cruel and strange for thinking the way I do”. “I know where I stand!” She cried out, heaving and whining. We don’t want to fucking see you naked. That’s a pretty adequate request if we are in your home helping you out. 

Which brings me to this. Almost a month ago we were asked to help caretake for her. We lasted almost three weeks. It was me, DH and toddler. I would have to actively ignore my toddler because this horrible woman would tell me her needs are more important than my child’s. She would call me at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 in the morning. All night. “I’m so *lonely*, CV,” she says as I’m running on two hours of sleep. Talking at me even after I requested to be let go from the conversation. So much shit to deal with. The toddler has far better manners than her asshole great-grandma.

Which brings me to why we left. 

One morning I am sitting with Toddler in the couch, watching Pocoyo. I can occasionally hear strains of conversation from GMIL’s room, with all her equally-hideous-inside friends. What I hear next stops me in my tracks as I carefully stand up and set toddler in the baby jail. 

*”I think CV and [husband] are drug addicts. I can tell by the way they are. Did you know she only fed me a piece of toast this morning? And then she had the audacity to go out and smoke a cigarette. The dog hid under the bed from her because she’s so awful. She neglects me and the baby! I try to be so nice to her but she is so sour and mean. I don’t understand why her and [husband] are together. It has to be the drugs. I just don’t see what he sees in her.”* And this went on for almost two and a half hours. All this insulting bullshit about me. She barely knows me, she blatantly made up crap about me. 

Hold the fuck UP. This woman had been praising me all the time (which made me incredibly uncomfortable). Always going on about what a good wife I am and this and that. I knew she was a two-faced narcissistic witch. And that’s when I decided *fuck this I am going home, fuck this 77 year old bully*. After she got off the phone, I knocked on the door after she said “Come in!” all cheerily. 

I walked into her room, stone-faced. I’m a tall woman, with a serious RBF. She looked mildly perturbed. I told her we were going home that day, and I was packing all of our belongings. At first she acted delighted we were going and then immediately got suspicious. We were leaving two days earlier, why? I stared at her, took a breath, and in a low tone I said this:

“I want you to know we are leaving because I can hear *every. Single. Word.* that you said about me and DH. I heard all the nasty lies and everything else. You should be ashamed of yourself. Good luck trying to get anyone else to take care of you.” She sputtered and squeaked out with “well I tell you that you’re a good wife and mother!!”

I stared at her in disbelief and responded with “Just because you say this to my face is not what others are hearing. You called me a drug addict. You called my husband a drug addict. I don’t want to hear from you ever again.”

Then I slammed the door and got all of our shit together. This woman won’t be teaching my child how to act like a two-faced bitch. There are so many more stories about this evil creature but it felt good to beat her at her own game a bit. "

She has been hard to deal with and criticizes me about my hair, my clothing preferences, questioning my tattoos, and what she deems genuine and from the heart ( to make a long story short). Well my mom is flying out here to come visit me as i have moved states to be here. When my bf and i went to tell his parents they both seemed cold and unwelcoming that my mom was coming to visit. The mother kept quiet (fluttering her eyes and rolling them) as my boyfriend introduced that my mother is coming Friday for a week. I smile in total excitement as i haven’t seen my mother in 5 months! But quickly seen my mother in law not so happy to hear the news.  The father in law says “well i won’t be around much because i work. “ which i found odd because we already know that. The mother in law? Said absolutely nothing and let FIL speak. Also , after that awkward convo was over MIL called BF and asked him why I didn’t introduce that my mother was coming over. Just thought it was pretty weird because we both didn’t think it was a big deal who said what. We both were present and my BF decided to take the lead.

ANYWAY DH works for a large company. Offices in multiple states, etc. We told the new location not to release ANY info about husband. Don't confirm that he works there. Nothing. 

Death Cookies called the old location and played the 'forgetful old lady' and managed to get the number of the new location DH transferred to. She then proceeded to call the new location. The receptionist didn't get the memo, apparently, and gave her DH's extention. As soon as he picked up he was treated to ear piercing wailing. Not talking or crying. Just full on banchee wails. He hung up, she called again. And again. She left 12 full voicemails of this before his mailbox was full. Then she switched back to calling the receptionist and wailing at her. 

DH was called in to a meeting with HR and had to provide copies of the RO. Legal is sending her a letter. The police in old town have been notified. IT had to set up a whole new extention for DH. I believe they've blocked her number as well but it won't stop her. 

But now Death Cookies knows where we moved. At least we already have security cameras, I guess. 

Fantastic. I feel like she's already ruined the new town."
50,The subtle criticism of The Queen of Bitchlandia,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfacd087b8>,SoVeryTired81,0,69,371,False,JUSTNOMIL,Sucks to suck Bitch!,1536043949.0,9ct7ri,"This is of course all in the past. Reflecting on the Queen lately has seen me realising that the Queen didn't approve of my parenting like ever. Like I knew there was some but it was just about everything. 

1. I swear around my kids. I always have, I taught them that there are kid words and grown up words and they shouldn't use grown up words. Now that they're older I ask that they not swear around adults out of respect. Swear with your friends all you want. If you get into trouble at school for swearing I'm going to let them punish you in an appropriate manner. 

The Queen HATED this. She frequently said ""if there's one thing I regret about raising you all its that I swore around you so much."" 

2. I do minimal policing of television. I don't let them watch Gore, I don't let them watch overly sexual stuff. We watch Futurama, Bob's Burgers, etc. If it goes too far we pause and discuss. 

The Queen forbid us from a LOT of stuff on TV. ""The Mighty Morphine Power Rangers?"" Totally about drugs. Once Aunt Becky joined the cast on full house it was banned for being overly sexual. The Simpson's was a hard no. She frequently pearl clutched about the stuff my kids watched. 

3. Growing up I was forced to eat basically everything. I have sensory issues and this was straight up hell for me. I have an autistic daughter and the Queen frequently told me to just force her to eat stuff. Even after we got a diagnosis. 

4. I don't have shit fits till my kids do as I ask. I frequently was told that if I was just more aggressive about them doing chores they would. She only had to yell sometimes! Yeah we were terrified so we usually snapped to if she wanted something done. 

Those are just a few. Anyone else have examples of their mother or MIL disagreeing with parenting choices?"
51,My bro and SIL are terrible people for not being the right religion and getting a dementia sufferer the help she needs,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfacfa5198>,CastielGalafran,0,19,35,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536092244.0,9czb58,"I posted here about a week ago venting my frustrations about having to live at home right now. Things have actually been pretty good in my house since then. I know it's not a permanent change, but I'm just enjoying the good moments before things turn bad again. If I'm going to survive in this house for the next nine months I need to find ways to not be miserable all the time and for me that means appreciating the lulls in JustNo-ness.

​

Unfortunately, it seems like my mom always has to be JustNo to either me or my brother. She can never be great to both of us at the same time. Growing up, if my brother wasn't being hit or screamed at it was me. If it wasn't me, it was my brother. Both of us took turns being GC and SG, although I ended being SG more often because, by virtue of being 5 years older than me, he achieved independence long before me.

​

I just want to rant a bit about this. I feel bad ranting because my mom has been so much better this week, but it's at the cost of my brother and SIL's emotional well being. This whole drama involving the three of them has been going on since before my brother got married, when it became clear that SIL was a permanent fixture. I love SIL. She has been there for me since we met five years ago. She's a genuinely good person: bookish but feisty, progressive and open minded for a devout Catholic, and will weather any storm for someone she loves. I was a bridesmaid at the wedding. My brother and I weren't very close growing up, but we have become very close in the last three years. They had their first child, a girl, at the start of June. This is also my parent's first grandchild and my first niece.

​

The entire issue my mom has with SIL is that she is Catholic. My mom is devoutly Orthodox. She has always dreamed of me and my brother marrying an Orthodox Greek immigrant. In fact, she arranged a marriage for me when I was a child. When that fell apart, she attempted to arrange another but I was having none of that. Because I refused another arranged marriage, I was called hateful, spiteful, and told that the devil was influencing me. When my SIL's great sin of Catholicism came to light, the wailing and moaning from my mom was great indeed. She went to multiple priests and monks, telling them that this evil Catholic girl was tempting her sweet son, tricking him into marrying her for his money (they were both teachers with the exact same salary). One priest told her that my brother is going to go to hell for marrying a Catholic. Thankfully, the others told my mom to chill the fuck out.

​

I was the one, however, that bore the brunt of the crazy regarding this. I was living at home at the time, and nearly every day I listened to my mom tell me never to have kids, because all kids abandon their parents. She told me that she failed in raising both of us and that there was no point in life anymore. I can't remember the number of times she threatened suicide during that time. My brother did not have a great spine back then, and she convinced him to have two different weddings with full receptions. One would be Catholic, but the real one, as she called it, was Orthodox. My poor brother and SIL had to shell out the money for two weddings, with the exact same guest lists, on the same weekend. And to this day my mom whines that everyone looked sullen and sulky at the Orthodox wedding (that may be because everyone was sullen and sulky because they were hungover and exhausted).

​

My brother eventually converted to Catholiscm two years ago, shortly after I ""came out"" as not Orthodox. So, of course, since both parents are Catholics, my niece was baptized as Catholic. Personally, I don't give a fuck. The kid could be baptized Pastafarian for all I care, as long as she is safe and happy. The baptism was short, there was free food, and I got to pet a dog. I was pretty happy. My mom, however, is beside herself and has been for the last two months. She is convinced that Niece hates her, that my SIL is an evil harpy, and that my brother doesn't love her. She's back to telling me that children will always be ungrateful and hateful. She says she doesn't even know who my brother is anymore and that SIL is just a ""mean spirited, vicious little girl"". My mom knows not to rely on me for emotional support anymore, which means she's started saying these things to my brother.  Every time my mom brings this stuff up to me I defend my brother and SIL. But it never changes anything.

​

She acts as if she's being a great MIL by not telling SIL any of this, but SIL knows damn well the way my mom feels. And it hurts her. SIL has only ever wanted loving in laws. She has an extremely unstable family herself, and she tries so hard to win my mom's approval. Her own mother has a severe case of dementia and doesn't even remember her own daughter. BMIL (brother's MIL) lived with them for the last two years while SIL taught full time and my brother was in law school. They tried their best to care for her but her condition only got worse. She would leave the house, forget where she lived, and wander into traffic. She'd become scared and belligerent. Eventually, her condition got so bad that, right before Niece was born, they had to put her in a nursing home. It was an extremely hard choice.

​

But my mom only talks about how selfish they are for doing this. She says they abandoned the woman and should have kept her in their home. She told me to never abandon her like that. I get that my mom doesn't want to end up like BMIL. BMIL is suffering and in a horrible condition. But, as I have told my mom time and time again, my brother and SIL dedicated every free moment they had for two years to caring for this woman. The only reason they put her in that home was because keeping her in their's would have been dangerous for BMIL and for Niece. This was the safest, most responsible thing they could do. 

&#x200B;

(ETA: Just to make how great of people/a couple my brother and SIL are, their first year of marriage was spent living with me, my cousin, and my parents all in one house. They had maybe three months of getting to live together in their own place before BMIL moved in. Then they had a week on their own between BMIL moving out and niece being born. They've always placed caring for each other and others as the priority. When she's old enough, I want to offer to babysit Niece for a week or two so they can take a vacation together. Lord knows they need one.) 

​

I just hope that my mom never says any of this to SIL. It would hurt her so much. Last night, I listened to a long phone call between my mom and brother in which they argued about all these things I've just shared. My mom kept going on about how he doesn't care about her anymore, about how everything changed since SIL came in the picture, how now she'll never have a ""good DIL"", and that Niece will never love her. After their phone call, I texted my brother and told him that I love him and SIL no matter what, and that they're good parents despite anything my mom says. I know they both feel guilty and frustrated. It sucks.

​

I'm just glad that I'll be moved out, making great income, and probably in another state by the time me and my boyfriend (assuming we end up getting engaged and all that) tie the knot. He's an Atheist Mexican guy from a long line of devout Catholics. I'm pretty much Agnostic. Neither of us would want a church wedding. I dream of having a barn wedding in a forest. I will not have two church weddings, no matter how many tantrums get thrown. If anyone has a problem with it, they'll be last in line at the taco truck and donut bar.

​

TL;DR: my mom thinks my SIL is an awful person for being Catholic, and thinks that she and my brother are bad people for putting SIL's suffering mother in a place with proper care."

Despite the title this isn't about an episode where Dr. Who meets Game of Thrones. This is about  VK's world view on asking others for help..  
Now VK doesn't really ASK for help.  She does the guilt game. And since my father passed away she has honed her guilting skills. 

Example 1: While on the phone she will say Wow, the grass really needs cut but I'm soooooo tired and in so much pain.   You are immediately expected to volunteer.  If not you will be given the silent treatment and this will be filled away in the ""reasons I'm a victim"" folder for later use. 

Example 2: You are over her house just going by to pick something up or drop it off.  She will use the 5 minutes you are there to tell you she almost died trying to carry a chair upstairs, she needs the bushes trimmed but just can't bring herself to get the energy, and she guesses she will have to hire someone to clean the gutters.  *guilt sigh*

Now if you are stupid enough to make a vague reference that you might be able to help at some point in the future,  consider yourself under a blood oath to do that thing.  It will also be done yesterday.  Now is not quick enough.  Tomorrow is out of the question. 

She assumes you will do it now and that it was promised.  You didn't say maybe, or I'll see.  You swore on the altar,  slaughtered a goat, and pledged your soul to it. You have 24-36 hours and what you have planned is irrelevant.  But these timelines are not told to you.  You swore the blood oath you should know. 

And when you forget because you have a life, work, college, children you raise etc., you  cause a tantrum.  That includes crying and screaming. She says she is a victim and no one cares about the old widow lady and how everything has to be done on thier timeline not hers.  (Even though that's the way it works in the real world if you ask a favor)

So if VK hints she needs her grass mowed, turn, run, and save yourself.  There's no sane way out of this guilt trap. "
53,MIL trying to snake her way into babysitting when my wife goes back to work,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfae407390>,TheBonusWings,0,1,10,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536119580.0,9d2sq4,"Approximately a month after my wife told her parents we were expecting twins MIL put in to have her work schedule changed to 4 days a week starting around our due date. Her reasoning behind this is because she will be watching them on Fridays while we’re at work. When she annouced this the next time we saw them it was news to me.  She spent the next 6 months telling anyone and everyone about how she can’t wait to watch our kids on Fridays. 

I appreciate family being will to help out for sure. The problem is that neither my wife or I ever asked her to do such a thing.  In a sub full of people bitching about their MIL, I think you can all understand my major objection is coming home to my MIL every Friday after work.  Thankfully my wife nicely told her that that was not necessary and we would figure out what we wanna do for childcare. 

A little back story on MIL, she needs to be needed. Her and FIL I’m sure are just devastated that we haven’t once asked them for help after the twins were born.   MIL’s other foiled plan was to basically move in with us for the first few weeks after they were born. 

Now that we are approaching time for my wife to go back to work the conversation is coming back.  All the peacocking she did for 6 months is coming back to bite her when people now ask her “well arn’t you watching the twins on fridays??” 

Well the day has come my wife is getting guilt tripped for the 10000th time by her parents and she tries to nonchalantly slide MIL into the Friday babysitting position when we discuss what we would like to do. Both in laws are master manipulators. Never mind I don’t want to start every weekend by seeing my MIL. Never mind she is guilt tripping her daughter. Never mind she drives me absolutely crazy. I honest to god do not believe she is capable of handling 3 month old twins for one day a week. 

Thats 6 bottles and 6 diapers in one 8 hr day. The woman sat and watched mtv for 3 hours the other day because she couldn’t figure out how to change the tv channel. And I’m suppose to trust this idiot with my kids?  I’m sure shes capable of keeping them alive, sure. But can she keep them in their routine? Hell no. "

I love my in laws, they're kind and warm and treat me better than my own parents. BUT they have terrible judgment and zero boundaries, and now they're raising their grandkids probably with those same exact issues. My SIL lost her kids due to neglect and is delusional about getting them back. My in laws live states away and are now raising the three little ones (ages 2-10). We send them money monthly to help with expenses because they don't have a lot of money themselves, and my SIL isn't sending enough if any (wage garnishment is likely). We do this for the children, and because we can't really help any other way through time or visits, for a few reasons.

DH and I are talking about moving across the country to warmer places in the spring, and the other day DH mentioned that we should see if his parents eventually want to join us with the kids, ""so we can help raise them too"". On paper, this sounds kind and nice, but we're childfree on purpose so I didn't put a ton of stock into the idea (especially since the court would have to ok that). 

Shortly after that theoretical conversation, we discovered that my MIL allowed a probable child molester to stay at their home for a few days. He tried something with my niece and they kicked him out, but this man had a rep for that long before he wound up at their home - and they let him in anyway. DH suffered abuse at the hands of his bio-dad and he insists his mom still doesn't know to this day, I suspect that she does know and is complete denial about it.

This situation is stressful for everyone involved for all different reasons, but now I find myself thinking about those kids being raised in a perpetual cycle of terrible judgment and few boundaries. She's trying with them, she has them in structured school and after school/weekend activities, but the saying is, ""if you don't raise your kids right, the grandparents have to"" - but she raised her kid the way she did that resulted in her raising MORE kids, because she did a bad job before.

I know that we marry the family like we marry the spouse, but this is more than I can get my head around sometimes. All the emails we exchange about money and birthday presents and them begging us to visit and me explaining why we simply can't (we're both hourly with no PTO yet, require four flights round trip, hotel, and dog sitting funds), it feels like we're ""helping"" with our money but at the end of the day, the kids are still being exposed to some potentially really bad crap."
55,MIL and the 'homemade soup',<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb6ea49b0>,Sheanar,0,19,255,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536048521.0,9ctn2t,"I recently joined this sub, and seriously you folks are the best. I've got a JNMIL (NC for 3yrs), a JNXMIL(LC), and a Nmom(NC 1yr). So really, great. Finally feeling like I'm not alone and in many cases seeing abuse for what it is. I could write so much just on what I've learned, but there is another sub for that.

For my first post I have decided to feed the llamas with a great BEC moment from JNMIL.

Backstory: I've known my BF for about a decade, but we've only been together a few years on account of her meddling. She's been spreading lies about me since she heard of me. Eventually, he grew a spine and we got him and his brother away from her.

Right before I moved in with my BF, YGMIL died of a heart attack, and right after GFIL was diagnosed with cancer. We live literally next door to him, so we took care of most of his day-to-day care (despite JNMIL's sister living next door on the other side - they shared a patio). Every so often JNMIL or JNMIL's sister would bring by leftovers and stay for a little bit, but then he'd call myself or BF (or BF's brother who lives with us) to help him clean up the mess they made. 

One time I was helping him with phone calls to doctors and making him lunch when JNMIL came over. She was oscillating between pretending to be happy I was caring for her dad and CBF. It was so awkward every time I had to deal with her. So on this one occasion she made a big show of this up-cycled yogurt tub full of ""homemade soup I *just* made last night. You can reheat it for him for dinner"". She went on about how good it was but eventually stuffed it in the fridge and left. 

Cancer is ruthless, and GFIL had no teeth in the first place and couldn't use his dentures. The guy was living on soups and mashed foods. If she cared at all she could ask him what he'd like or what he's been eating. But then she wouldn't be a JN, would she? 

The soup she was going on about was just some canned beef chunk soup she had put into a tub and made this huge story to feel good about herself. GFIL took one look and said he wouldn't eat it. When I showed it to BF and BF's bro we all agreed to just push it to the back of the fridge and wait for a good chance to toss it. She's one of those people who just don't care. She brought him soup for herself, not really for him. I knew it, she knew I knew it, but I was just smiling and nodding to make her leave faster.

Not directly related, but sort of. After she saw how much GFIL trusted me with his care she lost her shit (more) and added to the list of lies she was telling her side of the family about me. My ""favourite"" being that I wanted dead YGMIL's jewelry and such. Unfortunately it worked. By the time of GFIL's funeral none of that side of the family will talk to any of us, except for BF's 2 half-sisters (3 different dads between them) and they're on book of faces birthday card level contact.

First and foremost, wanted to give you all a heads up that all Jumble-liar stories are going to be posted from this account from here on out in order to avoid confusion. SO (u/cosmikd3bris) and I (u/nugmast3r) have both posted on here previously under our own usernames. SO has recently posted about an incident that happened recently and I wanted to make a continuation of the post. I will also be reposting previous Jumble stories here to help BB out and will be deleting them from our original accounts as they’re posted. We'll clarify which one of us is posting to avoid confusion as well. Today it's a me! u/nugmaster 


This is a long update from my SO's [post from a couple of days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/9c79z4/jumbleliar_fat_shames_me_on_facebook_and_gets/). Prepare your pants for the justice boner caused by the shiniest of spines and the inevitable rage stroke that comes right after. 


So we left off with Jumble leaving an emoji filled nasty jumble of a comment to a recipe video that SO posted on my facebook wall weeks ago. She said ""Diet and gym is more tasty!"" in reference to SO’s weight. This isn't the first time she's said some unbecoming remarks about SO or our relationship either. We usually brush it off because we're already over her shit, but this instance was the straw that broke the camel’s back. We're already pretty LC with her because of her past behavior, but she seems oblivious (not sure if this is on purpose or she's just that dense).


 (Check u/nugmast3r and u/cosmikd3bris for her past antics and context) 


My dad came over yesterday to help us with some house things, and I sat him down afterwards.
I touched upon a LOT of different things in our talk- her cruel comments, her unsupportive behavior, her manipulation, her racism, her paranoia that everyone is out to get her and is jealous of her, her materialism, her feelings of superiority for anyone different. I told him that her version of love is buying me things I don't need or want, and saying ""I loooovveee you"". Her actions never conveyed love though, they were all about dressing me up to be “perfect” in her eyes (old man clothes). She didn’t do normal parental things like attend important school functions (I was very musically active) or show interest in my hobbies. She was consumed with her work and drinking wine. She wasn’t the primary bread winner and spent her paychecks on more materialistic and unnecessary [things](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/8ses88/jumbleliar_doesnt_want_me_to_buy_lotion_for_her/). At the end, I stated that she is blocked on FB and we will be NC with her until she receives professional help (therapy) for her plethora of issues. Once she shows signs of improvement and understanding of her behavior, I will entertain a full apology detailing the damaging things that she's done, why these things are wrong, and the action she will take to ensure that these behaviors do not happen again. If she chooses not to do this, then she chooses to not be a part of my life moving forwards.  


Initially, I thought it best if I just don't see her or talk to her until she does these things. However, I reflected and thought it best if she heard these things from me directly instead of using my dad as a middle man. I love my dad, and he was a positive influence throughout my entire life. However, he was very much a rug-sweeper and enabler. I learned these behaviors from him and have worked hard to change. I’m finally at a place in my life where I’m able to call out bullshit, and not rug sweep or enable behaviors. I have a ways to go, but SO would agree that my spine has quite a shine to it nowadays. I thought things would be better coming directly from me since he has a tendency to downplay things and defend Jumbe…. Little did I know how right I was.


Anyhow, I emailed my dad and said we should have a sit down where I would tell her my feelings and where we standing with our relationship. Here was my original message:


“Hey Dad,

Upon further reflection, I think we should arrange a time for SO and I to come over to talk with mom. I'm basically going to say most of the stuff I said to you, but directed at her. I expect her to deflect and deny, but I will lay down my contingency for having a relationship with me moving forward. She needs help, and getting it is the only way I will entertain an apology and future relationship with her. Are you two available toward the end of the week?

Love, 
OP”


He responded this morning with this rug sweepy mess: 


“G'morning Son, This sounds like a great idea, any attempt at communication will enable greater understanding. I'll run it by Mom today and get back to you. I would ask to replace the expectation for deflection and denial on Mom's part with the premise that love, patience, and understanding are the greatest healing forces available to us. Also recognize that all our perceptions are influenced by our beliefs about self, others, life, etc. ultimately meaning that each one of us lives personal 'realities', schema with our own modifications, expectations, and limitations. Let's make our conversation educational and respectful, not accusatory. I would also ask that before you preformulate any contingencies for moving forward, that all of us be open to what this conversation will reveal, we need to unpack with each other our personal realities. I feel the results can have therapeutic potential for all of us.

Mom and I have talked extensively since the 'recipe' incident and I have come to gain new perspectives regarding some of the issues you and I had talked about. I have also been very clear where I think Mom has been outright wrong, judgmental, prejudicial, and inappropriate. Nevertheless, I also recognize that Mom is a person of great compassion who loves you with all her heart and in her unique(sometimes equivocal) way has always tried to act with your best interest in mind. 

Yes, over our respective lifetimes there have been glitches, mistakes, wrong turns, pains, and hurt; however, how we overcame/overcome these difficulties determines in large degree who we are. Today, SO, you, Mom and I are fortunate to have health, happiness, beautiful homes, fulfilling employment, and loving companionship. These are blessings not afforded to all. We have much to be grateful for.

Again, thank you for the gesture of getting together to talk, this is taking the 'higher path'.

Love, Dad”


I was very disappointed in his reply. We’ve been down this road before where I’ve confronted her, she’ll cry, say she’s sorry, say she loves me, and then is forgiven (and maybe feels attacked somewhere in the middle of all this). Her behaviors don’t change, it’s just a song and dance to her. It’s like Saddam’s “I can change” song in South Park The Movie. Dad’s reply makes it seem like we’ll get all the therapy that she needs by sitting down and talking to me, and that one interaction will fix everything so stuff can go back to normal. Rug-sweeping at it’s finest. I felt like we were already getting of course, so I replied with this:


“Dad, I'm not going to have a back and forth here or sugar coat the reason for this talk. This isn't going to be a conversation about understanding her personal reality. This is a conversation about how I as an individual and SO and I as a couple have been treated poorly and aren't going to ignore, enable, or tolerate this behavior further. I listed out these behaviors in great detail during our conversation and how damaging they have been to myself and my relationships. I'm not interested in having any revelations about why she acts the way she does as her toxic behavior is something I do not want to spend another minute contemplating or dealing with. Her behavior and actions are her own responsibility and it is not my duty or responsibility to be subject to or understand them. She has been nothing but unsupportive and cruel for the duration of my adult life, even before SO. Regardless of whether or not she ""loves"" me, she shows her love in a way that is dysfunctional and damaging. She does not have my best interests in mind. She has her ideas of my best interests, but there is a big disconnect about what she believes those are and what they actually are. Regardless of what therapeutic potential this talk may have, it's not a replacement for actual therapy which Mom needs. Any forgiveness or understanding on my part is enabling this behavior, and that is something I choose not to do. I've forgiven and turned the other cheek in the past, yet nothing has changed on her end. At the end of our talk, I will reiterate the same contingency that I had told you during our talk. I will no longer speak to Mom and her cell phone number and facebook account will be blocked indefinitely until she receives professional help to deal with her plethora of issues. Once she shows signs of understanding her own behavior and changing, I will be happy to resume communication once I receive an apology containing the following: a detailed account of her damaging behavior, why her behavior is wrong, and what she plans to do moving forwards so these behaviors do not occur again. There's no wiggle room here. If she chooses not to do any of the following, then she chooses not to be a part of my life moving forward. 

Love, 
OP”


Just like JustNoMIL clockwork, I started getting some minor love bombing text messages a couple of nights ago. One every night. First one on Sunday night (the night after I talked with my Dad) said “I love you son <3, mom”. One side note, she always signs her text messages with M or Mom… as if I don’t see who they’re coming from. We got another one last night saying “I love you my son <3! Our home is your home. Love Mom”.... Just ugh. She’s clearly looking for validation which will just reinforce her shit behavior. She wants me to be like “I love you mom! You’re the best! I forgive you!”... that’s not going to happen. I’m so done with her shit. 


Just got a reply that’s INFURIATING…. I don’t even know where to begin. The deflection and rug sweeping is strong with this one and it’s maddening. I had sat down with my dad and looked him in the eye and thought he was in agreement with me on this… He did a complete 180 and UGH! Here’s his reply:


“OP, Thank you for your reply. I'd like to excerpt and comment about some of your assertions.
""I as an individual and SO and I as a couple have been treated poorly."" Looking back at the times we have had contact with you and SO, they mainly are get-togethers over meals and conversation which have been cordial and pleasant. I am not aware, outside of whatever Facebook or social media comments have been made, when Mom has overtly treated you two as a couple poorly. I'd be interested in having account of these.
""her toxic behavior"" : From my perspective, to classify Mom's behavior as toxic is excessive and shows disregard for the good times Mom has been part of. 
""She has been nothing but unsupportive and cruel for the duration of my adult life, even before SO."" Again, there is ample evidence to the contrary, but not being taken into account. All of Mom's actions have been seemingly categorized as 'toxic' so any of Mom's actions that don't fit this schema are filtered out, discarded as irrelevant. If Mom were really so cruel then that means that I have been a submissive accomplice to said course of action. I don't believe you could have been so successful in so many of your endeavors and at this point in your life enjoy love, home, wonderful pets, a lucrative job, friends were you to have been subject at our home by such toxic, damaging, and dysfunctional parental abuse. 
""Any forgiveness or understanding on my part is enabling this behavior, and that is something I choose not to do."" Not being open to forgiveness and understanding is essentially closing the door to understanding how each one of us has a part in this issue. Your stance here basically stipulates that you are completely right, can dictate the contingencies listed below, and deem Mom as the sole perpetrator of wrongdoing. That is an approach that is unfairly judgmental and obfuscates the merits and faults each one of us brings to the conversation.
Son, I don't think the conversation as structured below is the right path to follow. I'd say we all need more time, not to go back and forth or sugarcoat the issues, but instead to move forward and live life the way we are meant to- healthy, happy, and constantly exploring ways to realize ourselves.
Love, Dad”
 
 
Followed by this right after:
 
 
“Hi OP, I do have a couple of questions for you to ponder:
How is it that Mom's comment about SO's recipe has caused such a drastic change in our family relationship? Whereas prior to Mom's indiscreet, illogical Facebook comment, our times together were pleasant and cordial, now there are vows never to see or speak to your Mom again, now there is a litany of reasons why Mom should seek counselling, now Mom's motherhood for you was and is toxic, dysfunctional and damaging.
How is it that Mom's comment about SO's recipe has culminated in SO venting to Mom with the F bomb* and you Son, to my face, called Mom an asshole? I would never refer to or address a family member with such vile language, ever, and I'm disappointed hearing it from both of you.
Love, Dad”
 

*SO replied to Jumble’s comment saying “that’s pretty fucking rude”.. The HUMANITY! A bad word!


This is where things currently stand. I had a gut feeling that I would be met with denial and deflection followed by some sort of compromise, but didn’t expect it this early. I feel like the burden of understanding and forgiveness will be placed on myself and SO…. and that’s wrong. We are not in the wrong for expecting change and action on their end, and should not feel as such.


I need advice. I don’t know what to do…. I feel like I’ve lost my dad in the process of this and that he drank the kool-aid hard. There’s not two sides to this. He’s trying to give a “both sides made mistakes and we should forgive eachother” type of argument. I don’t think us using bad words (we’re fucking 30) is equivalent to half a lifetime of treating me like shit. Looking for help on how to proceed. Our end goal is to be able to have a discussion with both my dad and Jumble about how her actions have affected my and SO’s lives and to (hopefully) retain the same quality of relationship I’d previously had with my dad. We aren’t looking on advice on how to fortify our home or personal information. We don’t see Jumble and dad as those type of people. Lastly, we’ve received a lot of supportive comments from you all, and I appreciate every single one. Thanks for reading my stories, and thanks for providing support and advice during all of this shite.

I’m currently pregnant with SO’s son. We are not married, however we are now living together. Boyfriend and I were together for over year, however boyfriends mom made no effort to get to know me until after the pregnancy was announced. At first it was great, and then once he moved out she totally changed. She has been not so nice to me this entire pregnancy. I have had feelings she did not like me at all, but bf continues to deny it and says it’s just me being sensitive until recently when we argued. After this I had enough, I texted her saying if she had an issue with me that I would like a conversation about it. Instead of texting me, she texts SO about it. Saying “I think a conversation needs to be done over face” exactly what I had said. Now I get the feeling she was only trying to stir the pot because she texting him saying “I didn’t mean to cause problems between y’all, I figured you knew about her texting me, however I think we need to have a face to face discussion”. It didn’t cause problems, and she never brought it up to me, or at all. Fast forward a month of me staying out of her way, she texts SO asking if he would like a baby shower. He responded that I would like one so she begins planning one and inviting all of her friends and family “to celebrate the upcoming birth of her first grandson”. However, I recently found out she has invited SO’s ex girlfriend to the baby shower. She was the only non-friend and non-family member she invited. His ex is not friends with him, and through the guest list there wasn’t a single friend of his invited. I brought this up so SO and his response was that she’s friends with his exes mom. Even so, why invite her too? Or at least ask me? "
58,General clinginess and GPS tracking,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfaf0b79b0>,arkhamdovahkiin,0,100,45,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536081307.0,9cxosi,"Hey everyone, I’ve lurked for a while and am posting for the first time about my FMIL. For the most part, we get on really well and she is (mostly) JustYes. However there is just one thing that bugs me and it’s that she is quite clingy!

Me and my SO are both 19 and at university (starting 2nd year next month) and have been together for 2 years and although she’s gotten a bit better since we got together, FMIL is very clingy. My SO is her eldest child and she doesn’t like to let him go anywhere without knowing and if possible supervising/accompanying him. 

For example, she insists she take him to his doctors appointments and any time he has even a slight cold she will act as if he is dying. This one bugs me because a few months ago I went to A&E (emergency room) from midnight til 10am for abdominal pain and she did not accompany me (we were staying with them) or ask me if I am okay (FFIL and SO took me). 

In comparison, for the 1st year of our relationship SO and I were long distance, and she forbade me from visiting on a planned trip once because SO was “very ill” (he had sniffles,  not even a cold) so she could look after him. 

When we moved to uni halls last September she did not like this change at all and insisted we come to see them every single weekend. I didn’t mind this that much, it was nice to see them and their cats, but we couldn’t go more than a week and a half without a call saying we *need* to visit. 

The problem I wanted advice on is the Life360 app, which is a family tracking app. My FSIL is 15, so it makes sense for her to be on it, but SO doesn’t need to be tracked and it notifies her every time we leave university. 

Once, she phoned in a hurry at 7PM asking where we were going because it notified her (we were just going grocery shopping...) and she acted as if we had no business being outside this “late”!

This Sunday we move into a studio flat in a different area of London and I don’t want it to be on the tracking app. I’ve tried asking my JustYes FFIL and he said it’s just how she is and I “won’t understand” until I’ve had my own children, as if this is how all mothers are. 

My own mum is very JustYes and does not track me or ask where I am going; she is much more easygoing and less overbearing.

My mum lives 3 hours away vs my FMIL living ~30 minutes away from us, so we’re hardly very far from my SO’s family (which I could maybe use as justification for tracking him if we were very far away). 

It just feels like FMIL won’t let SO grow up: I really like and get on with her 90% of the time but on the topic of my SO she will not budge on being overbearing and trying to micromanage his life. 

If anyone has any advice on how SO or I can broach the topic of asking not to be tracked with her without making her upset or feeling attacked (I don’t want to make her feel bad) I’d love to hear it. 

TL;DR - my boyfriend and I live together while at university and my FMIL insists on knowing where he is at all times via a tracking app. What can we do about this?

—————————

EDIT: My SO and I had a proper conversation about this, why he thinks it’s not a problem to be tracked, why he doesn’t think he needs his own independence etc and he’s admitted that it’s how he was raised but that he wants to get out of it because he wants to have a life with me and he knows that he needs to be an independent adult for this to happen. Tomorrow he is going to sit down and talk to his mum about the app and his decision to delete it. Upon my saying that I didn’t want this turned on me, as if I “made him” say this (as we all know MILs tend to do...) and he said that he refused to have this turned on me and will not let his parents place this blame on my shoulders. 

Fingers crossed that this doesn’t end in an explosive argument, but I’m happy that my SO is going to stand up for me and for himself. "

_______________________________________________________

**For those who don't know, my mother is a sociopath.** Yes, she was diagnosed, and I will probably bring myself to write about in the future. She's not your average selfish narc, there is something truly evil and cruel in that empty void, a void that she filled with my screams and tears. She was never phased by the idea of killing me or harming me beyond recognition and probably would have if it wouldn't get her ""toys"" taken away, she didn't have empathy or guilt, she just didn't want to be caught and prevented from doing whatever she wanted.

In the beginning, she was sloppy, mimicking emotion posed more of a challenge and she was slower to figure out what was expected and how to respond. As a result, she had more slip-ups and people ""wised up"" a lot faster. Most people would begin to realise something was ""wrong"" pretty soon after meeting, she never quite ""sat right"", breaching the uncanny valley, and left a sickly feeling in the pit of your stomach; her face would move but her eyes were dark windows into something so sinister and silent it made you want to scream and you couldn't say why. The smart ones left within a week or two, but she honed her craft over the years.

She realised that ""normal people"", even if they didn't want to know or do anything about it, would get suspicious and eventually question things. All the lies, manipulation and isolation in the world can't stop gossip. So she changed her focus to people whose capacity were reduced. It started with churches, they were already so fervent and gullible in her mind, if they could reject reality for this imaginary group experience with God, surely they would accept her and ignore how fucked up she was. **And the scary part was, she was right.** 

All she had to do was be a ""poor Christian woman seeking God and salvation"", and they would forgive her of anything and everything, embracing her as she used them as pawns in her game and provided a perfect cover for abuse. This later escalated into more outlandish and cult-like religious groups that included writhing around on the floor during prayer and speaking in tongues. To an outsider, they looked crazy, so they couldn't question her without taking scrutiny themselves. This trend continued as it opened a new avenue: People in need of help. Drug addicts and mentally unwell people cycled through her life, incapacitated by illegal substances that she continued to supply to lure them in and keep them around. In an altered state, they barely had the senses to function, let alone resist and it took longer for them to realise they needed to get out. Eventually, they cycled through her life as transient nobodies, many of whom were a risk to my sibling and I, trying to physically/sexually assault us and being abusive in many ways; but to us, no one could be as scary or damaging as our mother. 

She also weaponised sex with these addicts to emotionally abuse, using it to break my sibling mentally and destroy any comfort and stability they thought they had. All my life I became a meat-shield and tried to protect them, but there was only so much I could do, and even holding my hands over their ears as tears streamed down their face was futile against the fake and exaggerated noises coming from the bedroom designed to break them. I wasn't bothered by it, but the image of that scared and broken child is burned into my heart and fills me with angry tears every time.

From the outside, she came off as charitable and kind, helping desperate people. But in reality, she took advantage of their vices, vulnerability and kindness to serve her own purposes. 

**Those who got away have no clue how lucky they are, I'm sure they saw glimpses that scared them enough to save themselves... If they only knew how bad it could've turned out for them.**

**TL;DR:** *My mother is a crazy sociopath that covered her tracks by hiding amongst religious zealots and drug addicts, exposing me to some serious creeps and dangerous people, and used them to torture my sibling.*

_______________________________________________________


**For reference:** I have severe CPTSD due to abuse and neglect, this is a journey for me and I am still learning how to talk about it. My mother is a sociopath and a real risk, she has stalked and attempted to kidnap me multiple times, do not ask for personal info.

60,Living with MIL coming to an end.,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb2796400>,alienschool,0,22,27,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536091572.0,9cz7hh,"So I've lived with MIL for about 2 years and pay market rate for a room with other people's shit in it and the washer and dryer, resulting in minimal amounts of privacy. 

I have so many fond memories such as peeing in a bucket when someone decides to close the bathroom door while brushing their teeth or getting dressed resulting in my having bladder problems, having my personal items rummaged through and taken, my MIL yelling at me, MIL talking about white trash specifically while I'm in the room, and MIL having DH lie to his uncle so she could get some of DH's college money for who knows what, but WAIT! There's more! I've written and erased so many potential posts regarding living with her and my two BILs, one SIL, and DH.

Now things are finally coming to an end and we're getting our own apartment. I can finally rest easy, maybe put on some of the weight I lost due to stress, and finally get the privacy to have sex with my husband without MIL banging on the door to tell him that he left his mail on the kitchen table at 10:00 at night. Sweet, sweet memories.

One final nail in the coffin, MIL refuses to let DH take the one item he received from his GM when she was moved to assisted living. A nice wood desk. She says that she'll take it to us when it's the ""right time"". She says the crime rate is high where we're moving. It's my hometown. I've gotten more things taken and destroyed at her house than any other place from her and SIL. Needless to say, it's a bunch of horse shit and I know it has to be a final ploy for power over him. I don't want her to visit, neither does he. I don't want to ever give her our new address. Don't think he cares if she ever gets it. But fuck, I'm fuming over the desk thing. She always has to take everything good and turn it against us. DH says fuck it, he doesn't want it anymore, which yeah, it cuts off her way in to his life. But I just can't fucking let this go. Like, it's his decision to take the desk or not and I tell him that his grandma and uncle want him to have it and she got all of GM's other furniture. Why can't she let him have one goddamn thing? She takes and takes. Money and favors and dignity and everything she can get her greedy idiot hands on, but nothing good comes from it because she's just a miserable person and is never satisfied.

I just feel so angry. I fucking hate it. I want so desperately to make a giant stink in the end and just school her on how awful she is. So far, the best I can think to say without having flying monkeys is just to tell her how happy our lives will be without her. I just hope NC will be enough for me at this point. I know she's trying to be manipulative with the desk but FUCK. I hate that she always feels like she wins and everybody bends over backwards to please her.

Advice is appreciated. I'm just so damn done with this bitch."
61,Small Update and Advice Needed,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb7315160>,AllegraO,0,9,38,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536084665.0,9cy7kf,"So in my last post, I told you all how FMIL thinks FH and I should push our wedding out until June 2020 so FH has time to get a job and whatnot after finishing grad school.  That idea literally made me feel nauseous.  We’ve already pushed it out once; we were originally going to get married THIS June, aka three months ago.  I am *not* about to wait **another goddamn year**.  One of FH’s oldest friends, who we want to officiate our ceremony, suggested moving it to the fall of 2019, so postpone it by 3-4 months instead of 12.  That I can live with, and it’ll also make it a bit easier to find vendors who are still available.  Another bonus is that our honeymoon somewhere warm won’t have insufferable heat, because it’ll be in the beginning of fall instead of the beginning of summer.

Now, the advice I need is twofold:
•How should I tell my mom we want to pay for the wedding ourselves?
•What should I write to the people we’re uninviting?  “We’ve had to push the wedding back and move the venue, and the new venue can only accommodate 100 people”?"

My grandparents raised me. My father wasn't in the picture & I spent about half the week or more with my grandparents. When I was at home with my mother I was the target when she was coming down off something. She didn't cook or clean I did. I woke the other kids for school made sure they got baths and ate when we were home. Some of her favorite punishments included locking me in the basement and not allowing me to go to the bathroom. Sometimes I'd be forced to not take a shower and wear the same clothes to school. Once a school friend came over and didn't finish a glass of ice tea I woke up to it being dumped on me and the glass thrown at me after. Christmas presents we're always clothes in her size or books she wanted. She loved making me clean just to destroy what I cleaned like making me fold the same pile of blankets after she kicked it over and over. I have food allergies that cause me to get migraines and she'd purposely serve me my trigger food and tell me to eat it or starve. As an adult she tried to hit and choke me but I finally stood up for myself and hit her back for the first time ever. We didn't see each other for a long time.after that but once I was married with children she came back into my life she is actually a much better grandmother than mother. Shes mostly mellowed twards me but once in a while she can get pretty nasty with me. I have never stopped wondering why she doesn't like me but has a great relationship with my younger brother. Every single time I think things are going well she does something to show me that I'm just not that important to her. My grandmother just recently passed away and my mother has my name wrong not just spelled wrong but the wrong name completely in the obituary. I'm so hurt by this! My grandparent's and I are/were so close. She told me I'm being petty and I don't know maybe I am but I feel like this shows me exactly where I stand with her. I feel like is the last straw for me and wish to be done speaking to her. Who gets their child's name wrong ? It's not like she is grieving so hard she can't function she's doing fine with my grandmother's death. They were also not very close. I don't know where I'm going with this except to rant I guess.

My JYDad and I came up with some together and ended up with Your Song by Elton John. We both are fans of Elton and both love the song so it was perfect. I kind of figured MIL would do something similar with DH.

Nope. She ended up picking some song she has seen someone else share on Facebook. It was a song DH had never heard in full until the mother/son dance. It had zero meaning to them and didn't create a special moment for DH. I should have figured this would happen since DH is not the GC. Here some the lyrics to the song she picked. They make me vomit.

""The day has come to let you go. Only happiness I will show"" Poor, poor MIL can't show how sad she is that DH married and is happy with me

""Nothing takes away my love and it shows. Yeah nothing takes away my love when I let you go"" Ugh, all this talk about ""letting go"". DH was 28 when we got married. We had lived 5 hours way from her for like 6 years at this point

""Cause you’re my baby, always will be"" Blehhhhh. DH might be the youngest but you definitely don't treat him like your baby.

""Some years down the long long road if you need help with your load I’ll always be here for you, you know"" Vomit. MIL will be there for him because obviously me as his wife won't be there for him. Let's not even get into the fact how unsupportive she is of DH now.

SO and I are solid, he has a great spine. I live with SO and fMIL part-time so I don't rock the boat too much and have no immediate plans to move in full-time.*

So yesterday, let's talk about yesterday.

My day job is set hours at a computer - a virtual job.  I also freelance so I'm BFFs with my computer.  Glum Gabby has been told many times in the past by SO to leave me alone when I am working.  Now, I'm not heartless - some small tasks are totally fine.  But the unspoken rule is that (1) it has to be something she has tried to do and (2) if it can wait until I'm off the clock it waits.

Pretty simple stuff.

Even though the household now includes SO's niece (Glum's granddaughter) and niece's young daughter - many days when I'm here it is just Glum and I until they get off work.

So yesterday... It all started with a pair of shoes.  Neice's daughter's birthday is around the corner and she loves shoes that have sparkles.  Glum wants to get her a pair.

Glum comes in the bedroom, telling me the plan and asking if I can help her order the right size.  That's okay-ish.  Glum has ordered crap gifts off the internet before including this [ugly thing](https://www.google.com/search?q=monkey+shirt&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwixxd_726HdAhUQlKwKHb6ZARsQ_AUICygC&biw=1600&bih=794#imgrc=VXswtv03ctzrJM) and PJ's that are beyond too small.  So, confirming the right size should only take a quick glance at her phone.

Only, this is Glum Gabby.

She hands me her phone, and it's on an EBay search screen.  I know this is somewhat petty on my part, but it's obvious that she hasn't tried or picked out the shoes yet - and she is trying to get me to pick them out for her.  I tell her, ""You handed me a screen with lots of shoes, pick out the ones you want and I'll be happy to confirm the size.""  She gets pissy, clicks on a pair without paying attention and hands me the phone back.  

""Those are adult sizes only.  You have to find the ones you want first.""

A flood 'can't's came rolling out.  And when I basically repeated myself she shot back, ""You always have an attitude with me.""

""Well, you have interrupted me when I am working to do something for you when you haven't even picked out the shoes.  I will be happy to confirm the size for you - but you have to pick out the shoes.  And you coming in here is the same thing as coming into my office.  This is my work time.  I agreed to help, but I won't order them for you.""

Thinking she was being slick, ""I just won't come in here and bother you anymore then."" 

""Okay.  Thank you.""  Being polite with her is always a fun tool.  She hates that she can't run to SO and say I've called her a name.  She always has this look on her face like she accidentally walked into fresh dog poop barefooted when I 'thank' her instead of chasing her down and consoling her. 

And that was the end for a few hours.  But in JustNo fashion Glum Gabby was stewing.  I did shoot off a simple text to SO to let him know that ""I was a horrible person who told his mom 'no'.  I'm the meanest ever.""  Followed by a juvenile gif war so he would know he was coming home to potential drama.

I cooked a quick pasta dinner.  Enough for everyone.

Everyone was home, but SO was in a back room.  Niece was fixing a plate for her and her daughter and offered to fix Glum some.  At first, Glum wanted it - and then Niece said the unthinkable.  ""OP made it.""  

Glum changed her tune, she didn't want it.  Niece looked at me confused and I whisper that Glum was mad at me for something small.  Quickly said how Glum doesn't really like me in general and she loves picking silly stuff with me.  Niece didn't quite know what to do with this info - beyond being a bit surprised.  Niece drops it and sits at the table.

But war was brewing.  

SO came out from the back.  He also offered to fix Glum a plate.  She said 'no'.  I told him what he had missed with Niece.  

To color this - Glum never says no to food.  She has eaten my cooking and pasta more times than I can count.  If you bring her a plate of something she will always say yes or take it because it means she is waited on gets to be lazy.

SO went Hulk-mode.  It was sexy as hell. He must of asked ""Why aren't you eating"" 15 odd times.  

And I hear you... That gave her attention etc.  Glum only thrives on attention when she is the victim.  So instead of ""she was so sad, and hurt, and blah blah blah"" SO flipped it to ""What is YOUR problem Mom?""  To which she already lost.  She wasn't being allowed to sulk.  Niece wasn't coming to her rescue.  No one felt bad for her or was rushing to her side.  Instead, it was ""What is YOUR problem?""

The best part?  After Glum Gabby got her plate dinner rolled on.  SO, Niece and I had a conversation about vegetarian food (something Glum always tries to make me feel bad about) and Niece's other grandma who she is really really close to.

Suck it Glum Gabby.  

P.S.  I'm writing this because it helps me keep the incidents in order and I believe things are about to get more interesting.  I also think it is important to show how a SO can completely have your back and how that can zap a lot of the JustNo's 'power'.  

And if you are only commenting to tell us to look into other living arrangments.  That will happen with time - but right now it isn't possible. Glum has no savings and doesn't receive enough assistance to fund it.  It is in the pipelines but some other benchmarks have to be met first."
65,Life of lies,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb35fbbe0>,mamabear410,0,3,8,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536109473.0,9d1kd2,"So yeah just an update. I believe my whole life with my mom has been a lie. She has tried my whole life to get rid of or limit my contact with strong people. She has convinced my sister that she(my mom) is always right about everything and both my sister and my dad are now making excuses for her behavior. I have completely cut the three of them out of my life. 
I talked to my grandma( dad’s Mom) about it and she said she knows my mom is controlling but didn’t realize how bad it was. It recently obviously got bad because now my mom has convinced my sister to be against me and that once again, everything is my fault when it is not. My grandma backs me 100% and says they are behind me as far as having no contact with the three of them and my kids and husband will not be around it at all. 
Heads up to anyone dealing with emotional abuse. Know the warning signs and know that there is nothing wrong with you and it is not your fault. No more being the scapegoat and I hope no one else settles for being the scapegoat either. You can’t fix crazy. "

Anyway, if the title didn't clue you in, my JNmom and I don't have the best relationship. Actually, we haven't talked in almost half a year.  I might post the story later, but basically she took me to people I love and screamed at me in front of them saying I was infested with evil spirits...and that that's why I have health issues. I should also add that I was extremely sheltered growing up (username should check out) and this plays a huge part in my life even now.

Now I really love my D(earest in the world)F and his family is great. I've never had any problems with them. But I'm having an extremely hard time opening up to them after ""the attack"" from my JNmom. 

For example, last weekend DF gets a call from FMIL saying she wants to talk. DF thought she sounded a bit serious on the phone and that something had happened. (As in they needed a serious talk). Y'all, I went into a freaking anxiety attack for him! My heart was pounding, I felt like I was gonna puke and cry.
When he called her back to talk, she literally just wanted to chat. Poor FMIL is sick and sounds a little weird on the phone. But that little incident was enough to physically affect me. She did nothing wrong at all, but my brain jumped to thinking DF was gonna have a fallout like I did with JNmom.

I don't really know what I should be asking for, maybe some kind of advice to keep my feelings for my JNmom separate from my FMIL? I can't go to therapy right now (and I'm afraid to) but I don't know what else to do. I'm even afraid JNmom will somehow find out about this post.

This got long. Let me finish by saying ever since the incident with JNmom, I have been reading nearly every post on here. Y'all will never know how much you've helped me. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart.

TL;DR Terrible relationship with JNmom is affecting my relationship with FMIL when it shouldn't. Please help.

67,"Not the most egregious, but just have to vent (MIL figuratively shits on own daughter, expects me (DIL) to be ok with it)",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb16a36d8>,keakealani,0,10,7,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536111619.0,9d1tqr,"Minimal backstory, but In-Laws are conservative, we're ""crazy liberals"" (Actually socialist but whatevs). So is DH's sister and her husband. We're all pretty low-contact due to toxic behavior from ILs and the fact that they're socially inept and we all gave up trying to have a good time with them.

So a few weeks ago, apparently SIL and MIL had a big fight about politics. MIL's standard MO is to post bullshit conservative articles that are insulting and unfounded attacks against strawman liberals, get defensive, and then claim she was ""joking"" if anyone calls her out on the bullshit. SIL has a bit of a temper (but it's justified) and called her out, MIL passive-aggressively posted more articles calling democratic socialism stupid (If you knew basic math you would know socialism doesn't work, except the only ""math"" we provide is super skewed statistics about Venezuela). SIL snapped and told MIL off for being a cunt, and messaged us about it to warn us in case we talked to her and made a fuss about it. Also for solidarity bc DH and I had already spent the evening before complaining about the idiotic article.

Aaaaanyway. Fast forward a couple weeks, we have a scheduled dinner for FIL's birthday (big decade milestone). Family from out-of-state is going to be here (I've never met even though we've been married for 5 years), so kinda obligated. After suffering through banal conversations about TV shows I don't watch and never will watch (and have made clear I'm not interested in), MIL can't help but make repeated jabs about how DH was the ""easy"" child, and his sister was ""difficult"" growing up. Literally every non-TV-related conversation is not-subtle shade and I'm over it.

But then! The big kicker comment? ""You guys don't take me too seriously, right? You know I'm only joking when I post those articles"". I could not have head-desked louder (mentally). She is so passive aggressive and takes exactly ZERO responsibility for anything she does or says, and claims all her insults are just ""jokes"". I can't, folks. I just can't any more."
68,HTF do I negotiate the holidays with JNMIL...,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb678cb70>,TenaciousTapir,0,26,24,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536087679.0,9cyn89,"My (24F) SO (29M) and I have been dating for a year and a half and living together for just over a year now. We’re not in a rush to get married but know we will someday. 

My SO and I are generally on the same page when it comes to our families. Mine is great to be around and we spent 10 days last Christmas break living at my parents and would do it again no problem. His family is boring, we don’t share any common interests with them (and our attempts to do things we think his mom would enjoy usually fall flat/are under appreciated), they are not warm or expressive and conversations rarely go beyond small talk. 

So last year, we were living an airplane ride away and my sister and mom came to visit us for thanksgiving and we had a fantastic time. For Christmas break, we drove 14hrs home (our families live 45 miles apart), stayed 10ish nights with my family and 3 days total but only 1 night with his. We spent Christmas Eve and morning with his family and headed over to my family’s around 1pm to do Christmas “morning” with them and then dinner. We enjoy the time with my family much more and both feel like we are doing what we’re obligated to do around his fam. I encouraged him to plan a few more nights we could spend at his parents so they didn’t feel like we were spending all our time at my fam’s but he didn’t, which was fine until when we came over for a day before we were making the long drive back, JNMIL made a comment about how we didn’t split time very equally. Gahhhh! SO did nothing to make it clear that that wasn’t my fault, but I think he knows to next time. 

Anyways, that brings me to the advice part. We’ve recently started talking about how we’re going to break up the holidays this year. SO and I now live 2-3 hr drive away from our parents and my sister and some of my extended fam live in the same city we’re in. We will likely have thanksgiving with my family, but I think JNMIL will be offended by this because it’s my BILs year to be at her place with his wife + daughters. 
I have no idea what we’re doing about Christmas this year yet. We just have so much more fun with my family. 

I’m just looking for stories and advice from people who split holidays (50/50 or a less even split) and how to do this without pissing off in laws who refuse to talk about what they want and prefer to be passive aggressive. "
69,Drizella got a dress,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb167afd0>,redlaffite,0,1,5,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536119959.0,9d2u1k,"After my post I realized I should probably more charitable to Drizella 

As annoying as her constantly contacting me (not fiancé ) about her dress I don’t care about at least she wanted to make us happy . I thought I was being to harsh as she might honestly just be confused about the formality level.  Lots of places mean different things by formal semi formal etc .  For us Basically the idea is formal but appropriate for a morning wedding. Maybe my numerous examples (and fiancé straight up just telling men what to wear : slacks / dress shirt / tie if they don’t want to wear the jacket because of the heat) wasn’t enough and she is just a little insecure .  

She had sent a message to fiancé and I in a group chat saying how she is asking because she wants to make sure she wears something that works and doesn’t make her look over or under dressed . 

I figured parents will be dressed closer to formal than not so i guess maybe my examples just weren’t clear 

So I reached out . Called her and described dresses similar to the women in my family are wearing (all full length dresses but no rhinestones or poofy or really formal details. Most are in more breathable materials with thin straps etc because it’s in a tropical destination ) It’s a little hard to describe but it was essentially a sea of full length formal to (rather dressy) semi formal dresses . Sent her a Pinterest link 

I tried to be as nice as possible and even sent her some examples of the sort of dark green I meant .  

Drizella was really nice on the phone and told  me she was super appreciative and thanked me, assured me when she found something she would send me a picture before buying it to make sure it worked and how excited she was because she had a few beautiful green dresses in mind 

I thought “wow I’m such a jerk for being so annoyed with this “

....... 

She came back with: 

One short burgundy dress with a super bold bohemian type pattern

A paisley pattern muumuu that was all black and looked almost like a beach cover up 

And [this?](https://m.jcpenney.com/p/perceptions-short-sleeve-floral-sheath-dress/ppr5007733063?pTmplType=regular&catId=cat100210008&deptId=dept20000013&urlState=/amp/g/perceptions-womens-dresses/N-bwo3xD1nnujcZ5ix&badge=new)

Notice literally none are any type of green. And none are even sort of formal . 

And of course despite literally sending every and all questions to me she didn’t send those options to me. Nope. She sent them to fiancé after buying them saying how she was so thankful how helpful I was. Even some about how much she loves all of her options and was so glad to have something. 

Then she asked “which of these dresses do you want me in on the wedding day “

First of all weird phrasing .

Second I can’t tell if 

- she is seriously this socially incompetent / color blind (honestly it is a possibility this is what she thinks formal is ?)

- she really like those types of dresses so is ignoring what we said 

- or she is trying to make fiancé think I intentionally misled her on formality level

Luckily there is a 4th dress she ordered offline so cross your fingers ?

Fiancé said “hmm I’ll just wait to see the 4th dress first “

How do you even respond???"

•Peed on the floor because her boyfriend wouldn't let her in the bathroom

•Got a hammer and was going to bust down their bedroom door because her boyfriend locked her out.

•Busted into the bathroom while I was trying to pee with her pants down yelling ""Look at it! Look at it if you think I'm cheating!"" And simply said ""Oh, you aren't boyfriend. Sorry."" When she noticed it was me. Apparently she wanted to show him her perfectly intact vagina as proof she wasn't having sex with other guys.

•Came outside where DW and her ex-bff (is there a subreddit for shitty friend stories? Because oh man there's a lot to unpack with that one.) And drunkenly started teaching them self defense in case a man tried to attack them. She ended the lesson by screaming girl power before going back inside.

•Always trying to tell you what to do and how to live your life. 

•Found her hunkered down on the floor in our room giving our cats extra food even though they were on a diet. She thinks open feeding is best and even tried to say she knew our cats were starving because of how excited they got when she opened the food bag. We were like ""No, they didn't get excited because they're starving. They got excited because they're fat and don't stop eating when we open feed."""
71,I think my own mom will be (is?) a JUSTNOMIL,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb871ad68>,readyrosie,0,24,92,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536058393.0,9cuj6n,"Let me set the stage: I (24f) have been dating my partner (30m) for over a year. Shortly after our anniversary, we moved in together and it’s been really lovely. I could go into a novel about all the ways we are compatible, but I don’t think that adds to the story, so just believe me - he’s great! Another important tidbit- I was raised Southern Baptist but I accidentally became a feminist instead. 

So here we go:
My SO has always followed my lead with my family because we are a weird bunch. When we decided to move in together, I decided that we would wait until about a month before our move-in date, take my parents out to a nice dinner, and break the news. Unexpectedly, my mom went out of town so we were only able to tell my dad. He was great, congratulated us, and wished us well. Since I wanted my mom to hear it from me first, I had to settle for a phone call to her.  Here’s the gist of that phone call:
“If he loved you, he wouldn’t live with you before marriage” (Mom, I love and respect you, but this is my choice.) “I raised you better than this!” (Mom, you raised me to be an independent and free-thinking woman, which I am so thankful for!) “You are DENYING ME the chance to pay for your wedding one day” (Well Mom, one day we are going to have a wonderful wedding and I want you to be involved, but that will have to be your choice.) “GOD WON’T LET THIS HAPPEN! I’m going to pray for you and WATCH, it won’t happen!” (At this point, I reiterated that I loved her, but I also wasn’t going to argue with her. I told her that if she wanted to have a conversation about our reasons for moving in together, that’s fine... but I wasn’t going to get in a religious debate.) 

End phone call. 
Cue the prayer chain. 

Over the next few days, I received calls, texts and emails from family and church members letting me know that my mom had contacted them, and that they would be praying for me. I also received many weepy texts from my mom telling me that I’ve broken her heart, worried about my safety(?) and lots of other emotional dialogues. One time I called home, and she hung up on me saying that she couldn’t hear my voice without crying. 

So move-in day comes and goes without a hitch. Thankfully for us, we did not get struck down or break up from my mom’s prayers. Woohoo! 

More recently, my mom has uninvited us from one family event and refused to speak to us at another. When we were uninvited, I let it roll off my back because I hadn’t wanted to go anyways. However, the refusing to speak got undeeer my skin. We went over to their home for a family lunch, and she said 2 words (hi, bye) to me and 0 words to my SO. We left as soon as lunch was over because I was so embarrassed about that way my SO had been treated. In the car on the way home, we reflected on the day, on our feelings, and made a game plan for future encounters. (yes, he’s willing to try again!!!? He’s been so forgiving and understanding through this whole thing!)

This morning I woke up to another text from my mom saying that she was so concerned about me and I should MOVE HOME. This was the last straw and I sent her a very firm response telling her she needs to stop, calling out her behavior, and telling her that nothing she does will change my mind. No response yet, will update if it’s anything worthy of an update. 

Also, if you’ve made it this far, my SO is planning on proposing sometime later this year, we want to elope to Mexico next summer, and his family is wonderful! 

Phew. That was therapeutic to type it all out. "
72,JNM: Abandoning Puppies as a Hobby edition,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb678c2b0>,byacolate,0,10,80,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536061014.0,9cusrc,"TW: Animal neglect

&#x200B;

To round out the trifecta of living beings rottenly treated by my JNM, we move on now to: Household Pets.

&#x200B;

A little background: Growing up, we had several animals. Not in the animal hoarder capacity - no, we staggered our pets. Over a period of 18 years we kept approximately eight pets, and none of them remained in our home for longer than two years, and even that was a stretch. You see, my mother LIKED pets; just not the responsibility of them. She didn’t like that she had to pay for food. Or clean up after them (fur, poop, or pee - how fortunate that she’d given birth to human pooper scoopers). Or treat them for ailments. Or exercise them. Or keep them contained.

&#x200B;

The notion that someone could grow up with a pet into adulthood was a myth to me. Surely pets only lasted as long as your mother was entertained by them! People having deep long bonds with animals was some real *Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover’s Soul* propaganda.

&#x200B;

There is a particular breed of dog that my mother has always loved (chow-chows. They're wonderful, majestic creatures, so it's understandable). She had one when I was born that she never got over (but strangely did not keep) and when I was about 16, she decided it was time to adopt one again. Well, the puppy was perfect in every way, and just a month or so after, we go back to the breeder (yes, I know) and adopt another. 

&#x200B;

(Allow me a moment of BEC: This second puppy bonds with me immediately. Even sleeps with me like all those lucky kids in the picture shows. So it should come as no surprise to anyone that he is the one ousted a short few months later when mother dear is tired of having two big dogs around.) 

&#x200B;

We keep this large, wonderful dog for about half a year when JNM decides one day: “We should get a tiny dog for BB so he can learn responsibility.”

&#x200B;

So she seeks out another breeder (yes, I *know*) and we bring home a tiny white puppy. Very energetic. Very sweet. Really loves people.

&#x200B;

Fast forward a year and a half. Now she was **too** energetic, **too** sweet, and loved people **too** much.

&#x200B;

This takes place about half a year before I make the decision to go NC. I had been abroad for three months for work, and returned home for a week-long visit. (My very charming mother was crowing on the drive back from the airport about how she’d told eeeveryone at work that her daughter was coming home and so she had to get the house cleaned up - and then she simply hadn’t done it! She’d spent the day doing other things! Just didn’t do a damn thing with the house! Can you believe one person can be SO quirky and yet SO classy all at once?)

&#x200B;

It’s nighttime. We get in the house, and everything is a mess. Shed dog hair all over the floor, the furniture, everything. The dogs are very happy to see me, especially little sweet Lizzie. It becomes clear very quickly that I am the only one still charmed by her.

&#x200B;

She is *starved* for affection. At best everyone ignores her, and at worst they shove her away and shout at her. So I make a point to give her some affection. 

&#x200B;

And that’s when I notice the fleas. 

&#x200B;

And the ticks, some as big as my pinkie nail, so they've clearly been there a while. 

&#x200B;

They are *all* over her tiny body. When I confront my JNM about this, she breezily answers something to the effect of “oh, that’s probably because she hasn’t been bathed since you left”. 

&#x200B;

I was the last to bathe this dog, who spends several hours a day outdoors, over three months ago. 

&#x200B;

I’d been awake for over 24 hours, traveled over the ocean, been through multiple long connecting flights, but I knew that if I didn’t do something, Lizzie was going to spend another night as a feast for parasites. So I corral her into the tub - something she’s always been terrified of - and spend my first night back home carefully pulling ticks and fleas out of a screaming dog. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward a year or so. I was close with my mother’s then-boyfriend (the only decent man she’s ever been with), even after I went NC with her. He was from the country that I’d moved to to work in, and visited often, and so we saw each other frequently enough. When they’d broken up (he had a spine and used it, and she hated that), it took her quite some time to move out of his house. Since he traveled back and forth between his home country and mine, he was not present the day she finally left with my brothers. 

&#x200B;

When he returned from his business trip back to his home about a week later, the house was not empty.

&#x200B;

He found both dogs barricaded into his office room with two giant bowls of old dog food, and a week’s worth of poop and pee all over the floor. Yes, my mother had decided that there was one very simple way to both punish her ex and unburden herself of the responsibility of animal care with no effort whatsoever on her part. Who cares how it might affect the animals’ well-being? Who cares if something might have happened to her ex that delayed his return and left them starving, living in their own shit? Certainly not her!

&#x200B;

(TW: Animal death. I just remembered something as I was writing all of this up. Decent Boyfriend had had a dog from the time I met him to the day I left. He’d had her since she was a puppy ((and her sister as well, who had died years previously and whose ashes were kept in a very nice urn on the mantelpiece)). She was elderly, had trouble walking too long or quickly. Several months after I left, my mother in her classic slovenly fashion just let her wander outside because she couldn’t be assed to walk her. Decent Boyfriend gets a call from JNM to tell him that his very beloved elderly dog had been hit by a car. She died alone on the road, probably in a lot of pain given the nature of her wounds. The way she delivered this news to him was incredibly callous.

&#x200B;

Now what I’m about to say is all entirely speculation: while my mother is cruel in many ways, she has never been given to PHYSICALLY harming a creature apart from the occasional spanking. But I always found it odd that this could happen on a very straight, flat road in the middle of nowhere, where there is no visual cover around to hide an animal, nor could the dog physically “dart out” anywhere and surprise a driver. It was a two lane country road with a moderate speed limit - maybe 45-50 - that was never very busy, and she was a slow walking dog. For anyone to hit her - especially to the degree of the wounds they inflicted -  they would have had to had their eyes off of the road driving really fast for a very long time…..or it was intentional.)

&#x200B;

I want to leave you with a happy note. When Decent Boyfriend met with me after this fiasco, I was devastated and furious. He’d been able to rehome little Lizzie, but it was not so simple with the bigger dog. She was put into the local animal shelter, which was a kill shelter. I spent a long time looking over the shelter for her, and I was terrified when I couldn’t find her listed anywhere. I was afraid that they’d put her down since chow-chows are one of the “scary” breeds, and at the time were one of the top five breeds statistically likely to get put down first. 

&#x200B;

After emailing the director, I learned that she herself personally rehomed the big girl with a friend of hers who were enthusiasts of the same breed of dog, and had plenty of space to run on a giant farm. 

&#x200B;

Lizzie was rehomed with a retired couple who had another small dog, so she could finally get all the attention she deserved. 

&#x200B;

They’re both in the best places they could be, and completely out of my mother’s hands. 

&#x200B;

Little snotty PS from yours truly: Last year I finally got to know my mother’s only sibling, her sister, who she’s always hated. My aunt is very similar to my mother, but my mother is the dark mirror Just No to my aunt's Just Yes in many ways (including but not limited to their treatment of their gay daughters). Being with her was like stepping into an alternate dimension where my mother wasn’t a garbage fire in human clothes. One thing my aunt is well known for is her love of dogs. She has very, very many of them that she takes care of exceptionally well, and she keeps them for life. Their mother, my grandmother, never keeps multiple dogs, but she has a lifetime history of taking in one dog as a very close companion and spoiling it for its entire life. Spending time around these two women from my JNM’s past who are very successful at treating animals well makes my mother look even more incompetent and pathetic by comparison. If the shoe fits!"

How could you be so selfish? Shouldn’t your children’s happiness be most important? Your son is the one who’s gonna get married not you. I was willing to learn more about the culture and the language just so I can communicate better and yet you haven’t even met me but you prejudged me and asked him to stay away from me. How could you be so close minded, what age are we living in? All you care about is how you will look in the eyes of others but who cares, only a small percentage of people is that traditional anyway. You even threatened him if he chose me. All I ever did is to love him. Why do you have to hate me so much because of that one difference. "
74,We didn’t tell JNMIL we were in town visiting (purposefully).... obviously she found out....,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb38070f0>,littlebritney,0,97,206,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536037206.0,9csl2n,"So this weekend we went back home (we moved away 2 years ago same with other siblings) and we didn’t tell her because in the last two years, we always have to see her when we make a trip back. It’s been very taxing on us because she monopolizes our time and cries. 

So DH and I have made it a point to make trips for specific reasons, like family functions or to see specific ppl, so we don’t get caught in JNMIL monopolizing trap. This time, we were back for friends.

She found out we were in town. She texted and said “had no idea you were here let’s meet up if you can.... but if you’re busy I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND :) “.

So naturally we dodged that bullet and told her we’d see what we could do but we didn’t think we’d make it to her place this visit (which is cool cause we literally saw her last weekend we rented a cottage with her and spent all our time with her). 

Anyways I’m sure you can guess what happened. She texted me the day we were leaving and was super bitchy that we didn’t see her. I tried to no JADE but apparently I’m bad at actually knowing how to do that... told her “you said you understood so I don’t know where this is coming from” and “if it makes you feel better we didn’t stop in to see my own mother either!”

Needless to say. She lost her shit.

This all stemmed because my SIL’s mom asked us to go for coffee over fbook, which is how JNMIL found out about us being there in the first place and she was mad we made time for SILs mom but not her ... but as I mentioned we just spent an entire weekend with JNMIL.

My SIL said we should cancel with her mom and go see JNMIL.... I said absolutely not.!!! That’s what she wants. And if she thinks I’m going to completely change my plans for her because she pitches a fit (old behaviours) well she’s wrong.

I’m so tired of her. If we tell her we are in town she expects a visit. If we lie, we always get caught and she freaks. If we are 100% honest and say “we are here but we aren’t seeing you” she’s pissed that we isolated her. ....In two years I’ve been to see her EVERY SINGLE VISIT. It would be different if she just let us pop in, but nooooooooooo!!! She always has to monopolize our time when we are there. If we make plans to spend 2 days with her and 1 day with others she cries and is like you never make time for me, which prevents us from seeing my family and our friends.

I know the approach could have been better. But there is literally no winning with her. NO MATTER WHAT we do, if we don’t devote all our attention to her when we visit, she’s mad."
75,Intro to Giggles: light Boundary Pusher has stepped up to her first full CBF,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb3f6f588>,Agile_Strawberry,0,8,23,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536079469.0,9cxdvr,"Obligatory on mobile disclaimer. Have posted before, but with a different account. Going to keep this one for all related things, and start diving into the stories.

I was going to originally start with stories of my JNM, but this weekend, my FMIL decided to step up. She's been a boundary pusher previously, but more in the asking if you want a glass of water, you say no, and she brings you one anyways. The harmless kind that you make note of, but it's not worth fighting at all. She's got a bad case of babies rabies, and I'll share a store about shutting that down (which clearly only worked for a while) later. But onto the story. Due to her normal behaviour when boundary pushing, I shall give her the name of Giggles.

Quick background: FH (he doesn't get to be called dear for this story) and I have been together for 8+ years, engaged for 2.5 years. We had some paperwork problems (JNM caused - story for another day), so we haven't been able to do the thing yet, but just got it sorted so can officially start planning. We do want kids, but aren't in any rush. I also have a family history of having a hard time conceiving, and just went through an early miscarriage just over a month ago, on my birthday to boot. So I'm extra sensitive to baby things, and FH knows this… FH is also deep in the FOG.

The scene: we're at JNMIL’s place. I'm on the couch beside her, FH is sitting in a chair across from us and FSFIL (future step father in law) is sitting in his recliner. Convo is small talk things, and I'm more or less a grey rock of answers (also because life is rather quiet, so there really isn't much to say). 

Giggles (leaning over to me): so when do I get grandbabies? (With an accompanying giggle)
Me: You know we want to get married first. (And then I turned back to the main conversation because I am not dealing with this right now. We haven't shared with people about the miscarriage mainly because I don't want Giggles to think we are trying.)

Giggles asks if we've found a venue for our wedding yet. I say that it's really hard to find a venue for a small wedding. Her recommendation? We should get married  where she did, and have our reception at the same place too, and we should also do it in the fall like she did. Y'all, the way she said it, with a giggle, it gave me serious Jocasta vibes.

Of course it's at this time that FH decides to make an announcement. He's been on and off about getting a tattoo for years, and he's back to the on of it. He decides he wants to tell his mom, because her reaction will “be funny”. His sister has many small tattoos, so in theory there should be no reaction.

FH: so mom, I wanted to tell you something… (big dramatic pause). I'm…

Giggles grabs my arm. This is it. I know what she's thinking. I know I just said no, but she's ready. I look at FH, shooting thoughts of “say it and don't play with your mom's emotions"". He doesn't. He done gone and messed up big time.

FH: (he's dragging it out for as long as possible). I'm pregnant.

Giggles doesn't hear the I'm, she just heard pregnant and turns to me. I'm blank faced and simply say absolutely not, while shooting daggers at FH. He catches a dagger and says we aren't. He follows it up with saying he's planning on getting a tattoo, specifically a sleeve. 

Giggles starts getting a little bit of a CBF. She does a “but we're faaaaammillyyyy” type of response that he can't get a tattoo. Giggles turns to me, thinking I will talk him out of it, because I'm supposed to be loyal to her wants, and enforce what she thinks is best for her full grown in his 30s son.

Me: FSIL has many. I have one. If he wants one, he can have one. And I'll probably get more too. 

The CBF increases. Suddenly FSFIL asks a question (I think to move it into a more productive direction), and I start answering it. Giggles is not having it, and starts interrupting. She playfully hits my arm and says I'm supposed to be on her side. I keep answering the question (something about motorbikes and tattoos) so she adds that everyone is against her and it's not fair, in the full whinny voice (we all know the voice). I stop my response just long enough for us all the hear that, and then, before continuing, said “I'm just going to ignore that”. Full CBF. 

She tries again to guilt FH into not wanting a tattoo. FSFIL, just keeping the convo going, asks if FH has ridden his bike a lot this summer. Giggles hates that he has a bike. She thinks I shouldn't let him have a bike. And she thinks that even if he has one, I shouldn't let him ride it. I should guilt him whenever he goes for a ride, because she doesn't want him to. 

FH and I spoke about it all on the way home. He apologized for how he did it, but he's deep in the fog still. The amount of times he said “it's just how she is” was ridiculous. He's been officially warned by me to get her under control, especially about babies, because I will not keep having the same conversation. I have even gone so far as to tell him that her obsession with us having kids makes me not excited to get married, because I know the moment we get married she'll start asking again (she's been asking since before we got engaged, so it's been 3+ years of giving her the same answer). He's been warned as well that if she keeps asking, my default answer will be “why are you so obsessed with us having sex”. The good (?) thing is that this was the push I needed to truly look into pre-marital counseling, because he needs to get on my page about boundaries (he's made a few comments that if me and Giggles have problems, it'll be a problem for him, so I want to sort that out before we do the thing to make sure he understands who's side he needs to be on. I'm not asking him to turn on her, just to be an adult, say no, and back me up or buffer.)

We're pretty broke until tomorrow (pay day) so I was persistent in asking THAT IF I DECIDE (IF HE AGREED) THAT WE'D HAVE A NIGHT IN AND HE COULD TELL HIS MOM THAT IT'S JUST AN US KIND OF DEAL. Well, home boy decides at the last minute that ""it would be rude"" to ask his mom to not join us. Background info, I had told him, ""It's fine we can eat dinner together, but maybe when we start our  movie, we can just watch it, me and you."" 

And then, after an hour of doing my hair and make up, he starts getting defensive. ""Well that's just rude if we tell her she can't enjoy this part of her house bs"". (His dad passed away 10+ years ago, he said he would look out for her). Which i totally understand.

But almost 10 years (in feb) of being the third wheel in my own God damn relationship, and I'm starting to get fed up. I'm almost to the point that i want to break up. Like, if we were on our own by now, this wouldn't be a fuckin problem. But I don't know what to do. She, like I, am am alcoholic. And I don't know what to do. I really want to change things, but i know my bf will get butt hurt and manipulate things like it's my fault. Because it seems like it's always my God damn fault. Always. Im just so over this. 

The passive aggressive-ness (she's signing some bitter ass song as we speak). Im just so done with this fucked up relationship. I just want someone who will man the fuck up and tell his mom that we need some of our own time for each other. If not, I don't see us celebrating our 10th anniversary. I refuse."

DH was napping, and she was watching one of those baking contest shows (one that had already run, and the channel was just running the whole series again).  I was sitting there, playing on my Kindle (Fairway Solitaire).   We're talking a little about this and that, and the baking show...and somehow, we got on the subject of mother in laws.    


She started talking about how her MIL would come over and wax her hardwood floors, and then the kids would put on socks, and slide around to buff it.  (Spoiler:  DH says that didn't happen, that MIL did her own waxing but they did sock buff it after.)   She was also going on about how her MIL would come cook for them and if she didn't like it, she'd still eat it to be polite.    


I say 'well, I haven't ever had a MIL that would come over and clean up or cook.  Besides, I don't need anyone to keep up on my house, I do just fine on my own...as long as I don't have to wait on people to get up so I don't have to worry about noise waking them up.'  (small dig at her, as she got her ass out of bed at 12:30 yesterday...yes, while we were eating lunch.  Waiting to come out until after we had already cooked and were eating.  I did get up to throw a hot dog on her, and I did warm her bun like I did DS's, but I did not make it for her.  I don't make them for my 14 year old son, I'm not making her food for her.)   \[side note:  Johnsonville makes these sweet and spicy sausages...OMG.  DH and I will eat the hell out of those.  Some garlic aoili mustard from Walmart, dill pickles and a good crusty roll...mmmmmmmmmmm\]    


Then she starts 'I would never disrespect my MIL. I always talked to her with respect and about her with respect.  I would never say anything bad about her to nobody.  I was raised to respect my elders.'  


I looked her right in the eye, and said 'well, my former MIL is a cunt who deserves nothing but my loathing...and in my world, you earn your respect.  Age has nothing to do with it.'   And I went back to my game.    


She said nothing else to me until DH got up from his nap thirty minutes later.

78,"Introducing Hagda, or, Be Gentle with the Piñata",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfaea41358>,LikeItSounds,0,35,332,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536024509.0,9cr79b,"Hi there! I'm really glad I found this forum. This is my first post.

I have a jnmil. She is the worst. Right now I'm calling her Hagda, bc it works w/her name and she's a total hag, but I'm open to suggestions if we find something better. 

I'm sure at some point I'll be able to regale everyone with lots of flashback stories about Hagda, but today I'm going to introduce us with a story about YS's bday party. Also I have a serious case of sailor mouth, so, there's that.
The YS-bday-specific drama started six weeks ago, which isn't unusual for Hagda. Every year she has somewhere better to be than her 2nd gson's bday party, and every year I say in somewhat nicer terms, ""Go to your fucking lake house if that's really where you need to be while everyone else in your gene pool plus spouses is busy enjoying chocolate cake and not being an asshole."" Yeah, I know--YS's bday is always Labor Day weekend, but Hagda never misses OS's Memorial Day weekend bday, plus she's spent the last ten years boo-hooing out her vagina bc YS wasn't a girl, so she can eat a bag of dicks--I'm not accommodating her bullshit Labor Day weekend lake house desires. 

The story of what she had planned for this weekend instead of being a not-shitty grandmother deserves its own post, so I'll just say that DH put things to rights, secured Hagda's presence at the party (bc her not coming wouldn't be an option, we would have to reschedule hahahahaibustedasphincter), and we enjoyed about five weeks of relative peace and quiet, which came to a screeching but predictable halt about a week before the party.

There was lots of fuckery during this week, the prizewinner involving a piñata taller than YS himself which I feel she bought so as to be the center of attention at my mom's house (we did two parties bc my mom is in the advanced stages of cardiomyopathy, her heart functions at less than 20%, she tires easily, and my niece is also turning 1 so my sis and I decided to combine and take the party to mom, and Hagda insisted we take this gigantic piece of crepe-paper fuck-you trash to my mom's. We didn't.). There's plenty backstory about Hagda needing to be Important and Revered At a Gathering, and the gift of a large Pikachu piñata was suspicious in the extreme (her gifts are often Trojan Horses--stuffed to the gills with hidden agendas and self-serving motives).

Then there was today.

At our house today, there were thirteen adults, one teenager, one ten-year-old, two toddlers, and an infant. Hagda displayed less self-control than either one of the toddlers. That is not an exaggeration. During the three-hour affair, I did not once hear anyone call the toddlers down for the following: yelling; interrupting; shout-talking; being rude; meddling; ignoring repeated requests/commands to stop doing something; not keeping hands to self; taking something away from another kid and breaking it. I heard multiple people getting after Hagda for all these things at least once, and also witnessed each one of them myself. It is so very sad when a grown-ass woman does not have the self-control of a two year old.

The crowning moment was when the kids were outside for piñata time, a second small one she bought just for this party. She's micromanaging every aspect: where the kids should stand, who should go in what order, why the younger toddler should get over it and hit the piñata even though he didn't want to, blindfold--no wait, no blindfold--oh do you have the blindfold I told you to get? She's pissing off people left and right; the mom of the scared toddler is speechless with anger, DH is telling her to get her shit under control, no one is having fun. She's berating YS bc he's hitting his own piñata too hard, but while she's ranting about him being ""gentle with the piñata,"" she yanks the rope so hard that the piñata goes flying up, hits the wooden beam it was hanging from, detaches from the rope and falls to the ground. So YS sees his opportunity and starts whacking the piñata while it's laying there, everyone is cheering, finally we're doing what you're supposed to do with a fucking piñata, and that's when Hagda charges right in as YS is swinging the huge wooden sword we were using for a stick, pushes him aside, grabs the piñata, tears it open with her bare hands, and spills the candy all over the ground. SHE COULDN'T EVEN LET A TEN-YEAR-OLD BREAK A FUCKING PINATA HIMSELF. No. SHE had to do it. Everyone was aghast. The kids had to be encouraged to go pick up the candy bc no one knew what the hell was going on.

And that is my jnmil. Hagda. You haven't heard the last of her, llamas and bastards.

79,FMIL and the car - an uneventful update.,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb36413c8>,NoddyBowWow,0,12,79,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536053159.0,9cu19c,"So FDH and I timed it perfectly to where they would not be home when we went to pick it up. So that being said, let's get down to this bitch and her JustNo status.

My first encounter with her was when me and FDH were first dating, and I was being insecure about something and walked outside to have a cigarette. FMIL comes out, unbeknownst to FDH and tells me ""He is NOT cheating on you. My boy does not do that!"" (Arguement wasnt even about that, and I'm also FDH's first relationship. So, um, what?) I just said ""Okay."" and took another drag of my cigarette. Nothing too justno, but a little weird.

Enter FBIL and his (at the time) soon to be wife. I probably owe them my life, because while FBIL is MIL's minion, I got to witness from the start what type of person she was. 

FBIL's wife is a fucking bitch. She is only with FBIL because she is from Cambodia and wants her citizenship. She cheated on FBIL and their child isn't even his. She has told FBIL that she is leaving the moment their child doesn't need to be breastfed. She takes all his money and demands he works three jobs. The bitch needs to be deported.

.......according to FMIL. 

These two are literally the cutest, his wife is the sweetest, and it is obvious just by looking at them how much they love eachother.

I'll admit, I was on the ""just wants her green card"" train for a bit; until I met her and them together. So, I had the heads up that FMIL does NOT like her sons to be taken from her.

She pretty much adored me, up until the moment FDH said we were moving in together. I wasn't privy to it at the time, but she was slowly taking jabs to manipulate FDH to come home. 

-side note- I have never met somebody so preoccupied with other people's finances. She would bring my family up, almost innocently, and then segue into their/our financial situation. For example: my dad has had both knees replaced, multiple back surgeries, and is pretty immobile. So my parents have been looking at new houses. Houses that are not 6 bedroom, 4 bath, and three stories like their current home. FMIL: ""Ha. Yeah, that's what happens when you think you have more money than you do. Guess it's better than foreclosure"" This was relayed to be from FDH, otherwise I would have pointed out the fact that they are currently living in a trailer that they purchased for $2,000 and is being held together by duct tape, while my parents are about to close on a $600k home in a gated community that just so happens to be one-story so my dad can easily move around the house. - but I digress.

So, this all came to a head recently and I probably went nuclear way too quickly.
The financing company was willing to settle with us for a lesser amount, but FDH isnt the greatest at remembering dates. So he couldn't remember the date the payment was due. Well, I taught him a year or so ago to always record his phone calls. The call to the bank was made at work- no recording. But he did call his mom right after to tell her. So he said to just figure out what he told her.

Well, I guess FDH has a terrible memory in general, because he apparently didn't remember his mother saying that I was the reason for their financial troubles, and if he would have listened to her then they wouldn't be in this situation.

Say what? So, I go into my crazy girlfriend mode and listen to more calls. Every single one included some sort of jab at me, my family, or decisions I've made. And I can't even explain how covert they were, it was obviously her trying to subtly turn him.away from me.

The moment I heard that, coupled with the knowledge about FBIL and wife, I told FDH he had a choice. Either put that bitch in her place or leave. He apparently made his own option and just went NC until the car thing yesterday.

The entire time of NC, he was starting to open up about her treatment of him. He was having trouble with wondering if maybe it wasn't true. I just provided him with as many resources I could and cuddles and love. He is livid now, I'm going to beg my therapist to have his colleague make his appointment sooner.

Oh, and because this just blows my mind the most: we don't know where his dad stands about any of this. Because he is deaf. And FMIL refused to allow FDH to learn ASL. 

Chew on that one."
80,CleanFreak: NO PDAs! And why do you never kiss us goodnight?,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb673f668>,TheFilthyDIL,0,34,782,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536005970.0,9coucf,"​ETA: This was more than 40 years ago, and CleanFreak is long dead. 

CleanFreak was . . . weird when it came to Public Displays of Affection.  On our first visit there we were still in the newlywed phase, as our second anniversary was still on the horizon.  So we were (and still are) physically demonstrative.  I’m not talking about lap dances and tonsil cleaning, but loving pats and touches and quick kisses.

I was sitting on the couch at the PIL’s house when DH walked past.  I patted him on the butt and he leaned down for a kiss.

CleanFreak hit the ceiling.  “WHY DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BE PAWING AT HIM?!?  **DECENT** PEOPLE DON’T DO THAT IN PUBLIC!!”

Me: “Because we love each other.  My parents still kiss and touch each other all the time.  Don’t you?”  (Incidentally, my parents still affectionately kissed and touched after 70 years of marriage.)

​CleanFreak: “WHERE THE H-E-DOUBLE HOCKEYSTICKS DO YOU COME OFF CLAIMING THAT BECAUSE WE DON’T GROPE EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME, THAT MEANS WE DON’T LOVE EACH OTHER?!?!  THAT WE HATE EACH OTHER?!?”

​I JADEed.  DH JADEed.  I don’t remember any resolution to the “discussion,” if any.  CleanFreak was adamant that I said they must hate each other.

​But the next night, ah, the next night – bedtime came (thank Goddess!) I said goodnight and started to go up the stairs.

​CleanFreak: “Aren’t you forgetting something?”

​Me: “Did I only think that I said goodnight?  Because if I didn’t say it out loud, I apologize. Goodnight.”

​CF: “YOU DIDN’T KISS US GOODNIGHT!!  YOU NEVER DO!! **IS THAT ANY WAY TO TREAT YOUR PARENTS?”**

​Me: ""You aren't MY parents.  And I stopped kissing MY parents goodnight when I was about 10.  I don’t intend to kiss you and Dad, not after that fit you threw yesterday.  GOOD. NIGHT.”  And I went upstairs to bed.  IIRC, she complained loudly about it, but what could she do, other than add to her increasing catalog of Butt-Hurt Reasons to Hate Her Awful DIL?"
81,My car accident and fall semester of senior year,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb11c8470>,drowninginhighlight,0,2,18,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536079274.0,9cxcpd,"Not much recent updates on the QGR front. She’s actually been pretty tame/quiet. Actually not being unhelpful about the whole new job stressing me out thing. Still not telling her shit about the “bile/stomach bug” being a panic attack. Maybe once I’ve quit and found a new job. Anyways, I’m here to post about the time I totaled a car and how she treated me for the first six months after.

Now, I’m not here to play the victim or justify anything. I’ll give credit where it’s due, and I do commend QGR for at least not raising me to be a snowflake. As well as being one of those moms that would Bitch slap me inside out if I ever so much as rolled my eyes at her, or spoke to her like a ton of other kids spoke to their parents. But there has to be a line.

So summer 2015, I wanted to be a dentist, and was taking a summer class, while shadowing at a dentist’s office. This one particular day, I was shadowing, after a tumultuous all nighter studying for a test. Now, maybe I shouldn’t have been wearing wedges. Nor should I have used my phone at a red light. Long story short, I made an improper left and this resulted in a head on collision. A week before my 21st.

Initially, QGR and her consort were cool about it, and more relieved that me and the other guy weren’t massively injured. Just some bruises. And they didn’t really want me to regress and lose confidence driving, so they got a rental for a week. But alas, this isn’t a happy story.

The day of my 21st birthday, I had class. Shadowing in the morning, quick lunch, then off to school. Right before shadowing, QGR told me that I totaled the car to get attention on Facebook. Um. I didn’t post shit on Facebook or any social media platform. And if I wanted attention on social media so bad, I’d probably get a super expensive makeover and post some selfies. Not total a car.

Her consort was also joining in the fun too. They’d constantly be up my ass about being on my phone, and he had this new rule in place. All phones in the hall at night. Bitch I use that shit for alarms. The other actual alarm clocks don’t work for shit anymore. And he wanted to fucking walk from the enterprise office back home. Something I was scared to dispute because he often snapped at me about needing to exercise more. OF COURSE I TELL QGR THIS AND SHE SNITCHES AND GETS ME YELLED AT.

Around this time, I also found out that my “friends” couldn’t have given even a marble turd. This after constantly calling and texting about my accident. The mutual friend who informed me was supposed to be my best friend. And she was making excuses for her college crushes, that “they may not want to be friends but they want you to be happy with your other friends!” And “you have all these other friends idk why you think it’s embarrassing.” 

This was also around the time I got an iPhone and decided to share dad’s iCloud. YES I KNOW ROOKIE MISTAKE I DIDNT KNOW HOW IPHONE WORKS. So of course QGR snoops on my texts via his MacBook Pro. And throws them in my face, accusing me of sexual harassment (IT WAS MUTUAL FLIRTING. THANK GOD NO NUDES), and clearly knew about the friends thing. She belittled it indirectly. And called me emotionally unstable, along with a tirade of other things wrong with me. WHYYYYYY WONT YOU TALK TO MEEEEEEEEEE?!

Around the time the semester started, I was defeated. You llamas know the whole all science academic probation junk. This is just the prologue/behind the scenes. I had a new car after Labor Day, and was taking a defensive drivers course to get the two points off my license. But that semester was plagued by untreated depression.

At one point early on, she wanted to take me to a yoga therapist. She wanted to “get to the root of the problem,” and the school counseling center was taking advantage of me (PLEASE ENLIGHTEN ME). She then screams that I’m close-minded. Nah, I just don’t want to do yoga and meditation because you were up my ass about it. So we go to the yoga therapist, and I still hate her for reasons I’m going to detail in this next paragraph.

I told that bitch I didn’t appreciate QGR ending my high school relationship (I’m actually over it now, not sure if I’ll ever make a post about it), because two horny teens were sexting. And how she caused my ex bf to be bitter at me. SHE TOLD QGR. I didn’t find this out till finals, when I spent all night up studying and making a cheat sheet (sanctioned for the exam), and she screamed at me about it when I tiredly told her I guess we’d find out how the final went.

I didn’t know HOW QGR knew until we saw a psychiatrist and she simpered to her about it, and then admitted that she may have spoken to his parents. Or implied it. I know, it’s been 9 years at this point. But it was the principle of the matter. I’m a firm believer that people should fuck up their own relationships. 

It was also around finals week that she was snapping at me for running my mouth and apparently telling people she ruined my life. I mean. I didn’t use those words but sure whatever you wanna believe. She then proceeds to justify her marriage (tainted by her own JNMIL), saying that at least he was only an alcoholic and she stayed because her parents wouldn’t “let” her divorce, and he said he loves his wife and kids. Lol.

That’s pretty much it. At this point, maybe I’ll be posting some stories about my childhood. Not sure how many of those there are, but you llamas will get the scoop as more recent stuff goes down! "
82,How do you handle knowing there's an 80-99% chance there's going to be a confrontation with your JNM?,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb873ccf8>,second_glance,0,11,14,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536084714.0,9cy7u0,"Most of the time I feel like I don't belong here because my JN is my step mother, but I love reading your stories and try to apply the same concepts you use on your inlaws. 

I still attend family events knowing my JNSM will be there because I still very much want to be a part of my family. It seems as though if the event is small enough and she's comfortable with letting her mask slip, there without a doubt will be some form of confrontation. In my ideal world we can attend the same events without interacting and both enjoy our family. For some reason my presence brings out the absolute worst in her.

 This weird dynamic has been going on for well over a year. Sometimes she's okay with us being near eachother, she just ignores me or makes faces while I talk or rolls her eyes, but other times she tries to make other people believe I want to kick her out of her home and refuse to be places if she's there, to me she plays the victim hardcore and makes up lies before events, but then when we're around eachother she gets super aggressive. 

This last time was my own fault. She was pouting off by herself shaking her leg and head and I walked up to her and asked her to come hangout with the family. My intentions were to extend an olive branch and even though the group is small we can still be around others. 

Idk what I do that triggers her so bad, but when I'm not physically present she puts on a show (especially on facebook) like there is nothing going on between us. But behind the scenes she is bashing me and playing victim, it's gotten so bad one of my sisters kids, I repeat, kids, wrote her a letter about her behaviors including how she bad mouths me. 

So I know that this cycle is just life for now until either she accepts that we can both enjoy our family or I stop attending small events with her present (which causes even more drama with others). 

So JNMil, any and all advice is greatly appreciated. How do you handle going into an event that you know will more than likely involve a confrontation or drama? Most of the time I break out in hives from the stress of it. "
83,PlantageNOT: the BEC files,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb3807588>,NotFuckingWarren,0,25,159,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536035221.0,9csdw1,"Hey Llamas!  This is mainly some weird & BEC stuff, all leading up to the big blowout.  Standard disclaimers apply.  We are super NC.  See BB for previous crazy.

So when we last left off, PlantageNOT tried to be all Gollum about FIL's dress clothes and acted like the nasty, spiteful person she is and we had a baby shower in the midst of a family tragedy.  These moments take place in the month that followed: 

-The dueling phone calls continued, with a twist:  now PlantageNOT wanted to make DH the beneficiary of her life insurance policy.  All she needed was his SSN.  

Um, NOOOO.

-FIL gets wind of this (don't know how) and ups the ante: he wants to make the baby his beneficiary.  That is still inside me.  Then he couldn't understand why this wasn't possible. (Not that we would have gone for it anyway).

-Conversations start about holidays.  We tell both that we will split them.  FIL gets Thanksgiving,  PlantageNOT can come on Christmas Day afternoon  (cause you aren't fucking up my Doctor Who Christmas episode, I don't care who you are).   Both were pissy because we should leave the other out and give them allll the holidays because the other sucks.  

Seriously?  How about you both suck and we just dip the fuck out?  Yeah, thought so.

- Then we get to the main event:  who gets to come to the hospital after DD is born (at what time).  Now again, I will give PlantageNOT this.  She never tried to be there while I was in labor in any capacity.  (Small favors to your deity of choice, right?)  But we did have their RO to consider when it came to visiting, and she was insistent that she be there before FIL.  

Luckily, FIL was respectful of us from jump and had suggested he come the day after.  He did act like an ass that day...but that's a mention for the comments should anyone care to hear.

Summer turned into fall and the big day arrived.  After a fashion, DD made her appearance.  Now, I had made a special card for DH to keep in his wallet for the big day.  It was a list of which friends to call, which friends to text, and when for when we went to the hospital (we have a good sized circle of friends that have become our family, both in and out of state).  At the bottom of this card, it said: 

""Call your family at your discretion.""

Note:  Just so everyone understands, (and because it is about to come into play) my choice of wording is simply how I speak, and it was a wallet sized card.  So I kept it simple. DH and I had previously discussed what I wanted and he was in total agreement.  The card was a reminder because 1st baby and shit gets hectic.

No big deal, right?  Ha!  Sure, keep dreaming.  

I do my thing, DH does his thing (and is fucking amazing), the doc does his thing.  DD checks out and we are having cuddle time while I finish my bag of pitocin and get some feeling back in my legs (thank Glob for epidurals, ya'll, 46 hours from start to finish is a BITCH).  My best friend is there, and DH asks if PlantageNOT,  Sibling and Sibling's SO can come in.  I say sure, everyone is cool and DD is passed around (with my consent).  It really was ok!  Then, DH gets the card out to make the last round of calls/texts and Sibling and SSO offer to help.  DH hands over the card, it gets done.  Again, everything seems fine. 

Fast forward to a few days later.  PlantageNOT comes to visit us at the house.  And that's when the other shoe drops.  Turns out they were hurt by me writing 'at your discretion' on the fucking card.  Why?  No idea to this day.  Just didn't like the word choice. 

Now, I couldn't believe that Sibling and SSO would give a flying fuck about something so trivial, nor would they take issue with the notion that it was DH's prerogative when he called his family. 

 Time would tell on that issue."
84,CryBaby is...Done?,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb181a668>,BlueBee773,0,42,533,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536010583.0,9cph24,"Good news, llamas! DD’s first birthday (end of August) has officially come and gone with no real, direct drama from CryBaby. I know it’s not the nom-filled update it could have been, but I’ve never been so content to have nothing major to report. 

DH and I had canvassed possible contact attempts beforehand, having decided after CryBaby tried badmouthing us to my GM that we would not be offering an olive branch in the name of DD’s birthday, and discussed how we would respond to each if they happened, but nothing. Not a card, not a call, not an attempted visit/party crash. We were left alone. DD’s party was beautiful, DD was happy, and we were both able to just enjoy the day with her. 

Now, that’s not to say that CryBaby’s presence (or lack thereof) wasn’t noticeable; it’s just that it was there in ways that didn’t matter to us anymore. YBIL never responded to DH’s text inviting him down for the party, and AIL/CILs never responded to my invitation on Facebook (didn’t really want AIL there anyway, but couldn’t invite CILs without her). With YBIL, we’ve pretty much accepted that he’s taken his mother’s side, even though there is no need for sides, and that we probably will be/have been cut out by him. As far as the AIL/CILs go, we didn’t figure they’d make the trip anyway, as they live a state over, but we didn’t want to hurt CILs’ feelings or feed the “They’ve cut us all out!” narrative by not at least inviting them. 

So anyway, none of them came, but we weren’t really surprised and honestly probably were able to enjoy the party more because of it. The party started, they don’t show, and we didn’t really think about it again, figuring it was reasons stated above. 

But. Then we got home, I put the girl (who is now one, holy crap!) down for a nap, and we found out what had really happened via our Facebook FMs. CryBaby only posted one thing out of the ordinary on DD’s actual birthday, just a quick, “My beautiful granddaughter is turning one today. Happy birthday, DD!” Nothing life shattering, just standard run of the mill attention seeking/pretending for her public that she still sees her GD. The next day (the day of the party she wasn’t invited to), however, she posted a ton of pictures of a birthday party (cake at home, dinner out) for YBIL, featuring herself, GMIL, AIL, and the CILs and the following caption:

>>Celebrating [BIL’s childhood nickname] early. [BIL’s mid-September birthdate] is right around the corner. 

Hm. So the real reason none of them could come to our DD’s first birthday party wasn’t because of distance, but because they were too busy making that same distance to celebrate YBIL’s birthday instead...half a month early and just coincidentally on the same day as the party for DD? Okay. Good to know where we stand, I guess. 

Honestly, we’re not even mad, but I will own to being surprised. Of all the scenarios we had planned for, her throwing a petty revenge party wasn’t one of them, especially since this woman hasn’t done anything for a birthday for either of her sons—cake, party, dinner, etc.—since DH was 16 and even that one he planned for himself. I mean, she’d send money for a gift, but a party, with dinner, cake, and other people? No. Everything nice that was done for DH’s birthdays since we started college was done by me, and she usually didn’t even show up. Which makes us both believe this was just a case of “They’re throwing a party and not inviting me?! Fine! I’ll throw a party and not invite them, plus steal people from their party to come to mine! That’ll show them!” The cake was even themed for our alma mater’s rival school. And really? The whole thing is just...sad. Because this didn’t effect us at all, if that’s what she was hoping for. 

I’m beginning to wonder if it’s finally over, though. The morning of DD’s birthday, CryBaby apparently changed her profile picture from DD (the pic meant to look like DD eating birthday cake, see bot) to one of herself where she’s trying to look younger (think a different style of makeup, Vogue glasses...oddly enough she looks like DH’s last ex in this pic). Then the day of YBIL’s party, she changed her cover picture from one of DD (the one of her in a “party” dress, see bot) to one of YBIL wearing a birthday hat at the restaurant they ate at for his party. 

So she’s officially scrubbed her page of our DD, which is just not normal considering how much she loves using DD for attention fodder. We haven’t heard from her in over a month, and if there was going to be an extinction burst, I was sure it would have been DD’s birthday. I mean, I know her throwing YBIL a party the same day was definitely spiteful, but it wasn’t something that had any direct or real impact on us at all. Could this be it? Is she really giving up and cutting us out? Because, seriously, DH and I can’t come up with a single downside to her “cutting us out,” only things we no longer have to worry about or deal with. Or do you thinking I’m counting my peaceful, drama-free chicks too early?

85,Learning what love feels like.,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfe4244828>,loreike,0,3,11,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536087593.0,9cymrn,"Spinning off a ""what narcs say"" thread, yes:
Learning what love feels like is hard especially when your loved one has N-parents and is only halfway done working on his spine.  

He's so conditioned to stand up for family, oir no matter what they do or say to others, or how inconsiderate etc. they are.  I said for example your mom is out of line expecting us to cancel our friends visit we are expecting to come for the weekend, because she wants us to attend an improptu dinner.  Then - I get screamed at ""DON""T YOU BAD MOUTH MY MOM!!!!!"".  
Same thing from SIL1 SIL2, if I say something like, ""that thing your mom is putting together is not going to work"". then I get something like ""NO ONE ASKED YOU!!!!"". And DH jumps on their side gnashing his teeth along with the two sisters he refers to as ""the wolves"" and will start in on the ""and DON""T YOU BAD MOUTH MY MOM!!!!!

I told them all once, you know what, common law DH and I have been together 20 years she's my mom my too.  

But DH at least was trying to teach me to grey-rocking for years.  He'd say,""When we're there for dinner - can't you just be quiet and not say anything?""  

I always thought that was absurd, why would I go somewhere and then act like I'm in high-school detention?  Because JUSTnomil /  family oey.

But now I can grey-rock the shit out of MIL's the shenanigans and I don't even have to go - to the concert for tribute to artist I've never listen too.

Oh, even though concert is 3 days after DH's upcoming birthday there  was no mention of, ""we'll get your ticket for you since it's your birthday and this is my idea."" Nope. And we live out of town and the ticket office is 10 min from their place but not only is the birthday not mentioned she made it DH's responsibility to buy all the tickets, for them, their 4 friends, and throws in as we walk out the door, ""and remember to buy tickets for your sisters!!!

DH was so ticked off because the sisters never have money to apy back anything, even outright small loans. So he didn't buy them for 3 weeks, would not respond to the calls and messages of  ,""remember to get those tickets..."","" it's getting late, the good seats will be gone."" So eventually because the on-line system is such a pain we go to the actual venue and buy the tix on my credit card. Mom leaves message , ""rememeber I only want 6 tickets"". As in, not your sisters, you sort that out.  Total slow burn.
Lately, when we're in the city he'll take a short cut through his old neighbourhood, drive right past their street and says nothing.  I also stay silent.  
Fortunately, (for MIL) she coughed up the money for all the tickets except his.  Oh, and she was really SAD to hear I wqsn't oming.  That's right, I won't expose myself to her or ""the wolves"", unnecessarily, and the concert is on a Monday night and we live 1 1/2 hours away so - I have to get to bed on time for work. At least DH didn't in the least try to get me to go.  Whew.

86,Update to: 13 days out and over it.,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb1688be0>,modernjaneausten,0,63,183,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536031496.0,9crzzj,"So I dropped the rope for the catering choices and told FH to deal with it, and my mom and I have a game plan together for food for myself and my bridesmaids. But trying to talk to FH about how his mom and brother have made me feel during the planning process was a disaster. It's starting to feel like the 3 of them against the world, and like somehow I'm creating issues where there are none. How do I approach this without either one of us getting defensive? We can never agree on the fact that his mom is kind of controlling. His dad has straight up said to my dad that she always controlled the boys. How does he not see it? I'm tired of getting the ""mommy knows best"" routine just because she and the other people he grew up with all have this formula for weddings and bridal/baby showers. I told him I was willing to drop things if it was just about cost, but she wanted us to change the veggies and fruits to something else entirely. 

Updated to add: FH and I had a long talk about a lot of the things contributing to this blowup, and he gets why I'm stressed but I think he's frustrated feeling like I'm always ready for a fight with her. You guys won't like this but he was kinda right about that. But I did thoroughly explain how it feels like me vs them and that I get frustrated with being told she knows more. She does but I also had done a ton of research and brainstorming and consulting with others for what I wanted, and I pointed out the only details that have changed have involved his mom or brother. We both agreed we need to be team us and I told him I will happily askfor her or my mom's guidance in life if we have kids but I'm not having any until we have been married awhile and can get him out of the fog. I will be taking the suggestions for counseling for us because I love him dearly and I think he's worth it. And since I only post about negative situations with his mom, I haven't been able to give background on all the times he does stand up for us. I'm also taking someone's suggestion to get his dad involved. I'm hopeful he can help. "
87,Cutting ties with step-grandmother after grandfather’s death,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb4466860>,mrsnosythecat,0,6,3,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536118507.0,9d2ohk,"I originally posted this to r/justnofamily and was told I would be able to post this here. 

Background: My SGM is a typical rug sweeping, finger pointing, lying, perpetual victim of a person. She is never wrong, nothing is ever her fault, she cannot apologize to save her life, anything that happens is always someone’s fault (spoiler alert: except her), everyone is out to “get” her, and she thinks she is perfect and innocent in all situations.

I haven’t spoken to my SGM since my paternal grandfather’s death from cancer at the end of July. I was civil at the funeral home but took great care to avoid her. During his final few months, SGM alienated his family and friends, preferring her fellow Pentecostal cult members to visit him instead, literally shutting out family members to herd in giant groups of church people that had never met him before.  

She robbed my mother of her final time with my grandfather by purposely giving him medicine to make him go to sleep when she found out my mother was coming to spend her (final) time with him.

She gossips freely about my husband and I. My husband was raised in the Pentecostal holiness cult she is a part of, and most of his family is of that denomination. She has lectured me about making sure he stays true to that church, lest he be condemned, and scolded me for DH and I not following their church’s “rules”. I’m talking she straight up degraded DH as a Christian and a person. Her religion also serves as a way to further her “I’m sinless and always the victim” mentality. Any time she has been around my husband, she asks him about other holiness people or ministers, and calls him “Brother FirstName”. My husband has since left that denomination. 

On different occasions, she has:
made a racist comment about my husband (called him a “foreigner”; he’s half Mexican, born and raised in the US), made nasty comments about, and in front of, every member of my family, and told my great grandmother (her MIL) that if my grandfather (GGM’s son and SGM’s husband) didn’t start going to church with her, she “wished he would just go ahead and die so she could find someone who would go to church with her” (this was years before my grandfather was actually diagnosed and later passed away from cancer. He was converted to her cult a couple months before his death and only then did she consider him “saved”).

I actually used to be really close to her, and now I can’t see how I ever was. She was actually the grandparent I was closest to. Either she knew I would always get over it all and forgive her or she honestly believes nothing she does is wrong. So this has been a long time coming. Over the course of the past month or so, I have ignored every attempt she has made to get in touch with me. Everything from asking if I wanted a wreath from my grandfather’s funeral, to saying she had an air fryer if I wanted to use it, to sending me one of my own pins from Pinterest with the caption “love it”. She has also left small gifts on my car as an attempt to get me to communicate with her. Unfortunately we live on the same dead end road, as do my parents and an uncle, so as long as she lives there, she will be driving by my house, seeing if I’m home or not, and seeing my husband and I outside. 

She recently told my father, who still has to speak to her because of business they are in as a result of my grandfather passing, that my husband and I have told her we were never stepping foot in her house again. This is a bold faced lie. Neither of us have ever said anything like that to her, though we indeed do not plan to ever be in her house again. Whenever she is caught in a lie like this, she tries to back up and say she “worded it wrong”. 

I could write countless posts on all of the horrible things she has done. This isn’t even a tip of the iceberg, just some of the more notable offenses. As far as cutting contact with her, should I keep ignoring her, or should I formally put stop to her contacting me and confront her (through text) for talking about DH and I to other people? The rest of my family is also cutting ties with her as far as holidays and things go. I have also now blocked her on Pinterest. 

Part of me hates to cut contact because of the relationship we used to have. However, I have to do what is best for me and my family. She has proved, time and time again, that she does not deserve a place in our lives. 

This is long, so thank you for reading. I appreciate any advice you all may have to offer."
88,Because 2am is an excellent time to ask your child a question,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb664fda0>,crazyspottedcatlady,0,4,32,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536059906.0,9cuopp,"A bit of context is required for this one, because it involves the cousin of my mother's first sister. Said sister was a little shit as a kid and forever telling lies and setting her siblings up to get them in trouble with their parents. My grandma caught her one day inflicting injuries on herself (not major - think something like a rug burn) which she claimed her brothers had inflicted, not knowing grandma had seen her doing it to herself.  This was in the day where Feet Didn't Touch if you misbehaved so you can imagine how that worked out for her. My grandma never did believe a word that came out of her mouth afterwards.

Now my mom is well established as being nocturnal. She's never out of bed before 12pm and even that's pushing it. This results in her being up all night, which is also important.

My aunt had three children but her youngest was the only girl. My mom occasionally babysat the girl for her (this was also the only *socialisation* I received as a child) and she would ""play"" with me (read: be a little shit until she got her own way). This occasion was one of those times.  At the time, she was sitting on the floor in front of the desk I was sitting at colouring, watching the TV. As they tend to do when put down carelessly by a young child, one of my crayons rolled off the edge of the desk and bonked her on the head.  She wasn't upset at the time, and handed me my crayon back, and that was it as far as I was concerned.

Until 2am that morning, when my mother dragged me out of bed. I'm confused, tired and scared because if looks could kill, she'd be childless.  She demands to know if I had bullied my cousin.

Yes, my auntie called her later that evening and apparently my cousin had told a tale about how I kept hitting her in the head with my crayons on purpose.

My mother waited until 2am so she could drag me out of bed and scare the crap out of me to accuse me of bullying my cousin.  Who was very much her mother's double and well known for telling tall tales just like her mother.

In fairness, I wouldn't be angry about this looking back if she hadn't *waited until 2am* to ask me about it, thus disturbing my sleep. She had a damn good idea that these accusations were false anyway, and when she went back to my auntie to tell her my cousin was a lying little shit, she even pointed out the hundreds of times my auntie had *told lies to get her in trouble with their parents* before now as to why her precious little angel would lie about me throwing crayons at her!

The upside was said cousin wasn't allowed to come over any more, which as you can imagine was no great loss to me.  As far as I'm aware, she's grown up considerably and has a family of her own now, but we're NC because of this incident.

An update on the health stuff also touched upon on the last post: I know full well that I have FM's in the family.  I'm not too concerned because I simply don't share anything I'm not okay with eventually making its way back to my mom.  In any case, I have been diagnosed recently with a condition that can either be a standalone ailment, or a symptom of two or three other, more severe ailments, so the current plan is to treat it as if it were the standalone ailment for now and see if it improves - if not, then we dig deeper.  This means I've currently got a splint on the affected limb.

My mom's input, on learning that I had this condition, which is absolutely NOTHING to do with genetics: ""The wrists in this family have always been weak!"" The only history of anything remotely similar in my family is a case of repetitive strain injury, which is not even close to what I have been assessed with.  NC and I still can't be ill, apparently."

I'm not sure if her behavior is what you would call BEC or not but here it goes. . . .


When my oldest turned 12 I started letting her wear crop tops. Nothing too short or provocative, but yes, her belly button showed. My mom would make little remarks/jokes about my daughter leaving half of her shirt at home or say she needs a refund because the store didn't give her the whole shirt. Que eye roll. When it really started to bug me was when my mom would ""jokingly"" pull on my daughters shirt to make it longer then complain that the top was now too low cut. . . *Um, duh. you just pulled on it!*
 I personally find nothing wrong with a cute crop top and am of the mindset that if you see something wrong with one on a child then you are the problem, not the child.


Now my daughter is 13 and has taken to big hoop earrings. My mom has a problem with this as well and told me that I need to put a stop to ""All of that"". Um, what the hell does that mean? I feel like she is implying that my child is going to wind up being a slut or something and it will be my fault because I let the girl wear some damn earrings and a short shirt!!! Ugh, maybe I'm wrong. (this may open a whole other can of worms but, while I obviously don't approve of my young daughter being sexually active, we have had age appropriate talks and I am very open with her. I don't believe a female should be shamed if she happens to enjoy sex)


Now to talk about my youngest daughter, she 2 &1/2 and I still breastfeed. My mom will scold her every time she asks to nurse. She tells my daughter that she is too big for that and that she need to eat food like a big girl. My daughter will then start crying and apologize for not being a big girl. WTF? Just leave my baby alone. She will quit when she is ready. And no I will NOT starve her until she is forced to eat ""real food"", why would you even suggest that???

Why are men so blind to their mommies?,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfe42360f0>,kerryap,0,30,82,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536038593.0,9csq1f,"As I’m posting on JustNoMIL safe guess I’m not a fan of mine and she’s racked up some very bad behavior in the 4 years I’ve been married to my husband. Had she lived in the country while we’d been dating I’m convinced we would never have gotten engaged let alone married. The last four years have been a roller coaster of stress and frustration at both her behavior and my husband’s short memory and increasingly creative ways to dismiss her behavior as less than it is. 

Finally two years ago things escalated and I finally refused to be in the same room with her. She’s insulted me to my face, tried to slam my hand in the dishwasher, meddled in my marriage (including snooping in our bedroom and even IN our BED) and all around made life miserable. 

The no contact was short lived. DH insisted he wanted “family” to be together for Christmas. I relented with the condition that it would be on neutral territory. I was not going to her home (seat of power) nor letting her in my home. The idea of trying to prevent her from snooping again or worse getting her out of my house when I’d reached my max was a firm No Go. Christmas 2017 was spent at Whistler. The location had something for everyone adult or toddler. Everyone stayed several days, Christmas was bearable. 

I did not however like planning last minute, nor paying last minute prices and insisted we book with more notice for 2018. Upon departing I suggested to all parties Hawaii, any thoughts. To my face MIL was agreeable. My husband has observed me plan, list build, research and all but book this even for 9 months. Now I’m insisting we book. Upon sharing the plan with MIL husband comes back with following text “Mom would rather spend her birthday (Jan 25th) in Hawaii. How about we go to Boston instead.” 

We have a 3year old and my last recollection of Boston was a very adult town. But the suggested alternative location is beside the point. DH was shocked when I didn’t really think this was a swell idea. **Why are men so stupid about their mommies**. If this had come from anyone else he would have caught it a mile off. “I have decided on Hawaii for my birthday so you can’t go for Christmas.” Come on dude this is rude!!!! "
91,Advice on rude remarks?,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb34a5eb8>,OrdinaryMouse2,0,10,12,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536076350.0,9cwvk7,"JNMom constantly talks shit about people behind their backs. It doesn't matter who they are - she does this with literally everyone. It's generally really gross, uncomfortable triangulation. 

(Actual examples: A classmate's mom is on disability because she's so fat and lazy, how gross and lazy! Your cousin's parents think she's smart but she's really, well, *average at best*. I can't believe anyone would give their kid Ritalin, they obviously just want to make medicated zombies. Your father is so irresponsible and leaves me alone all the time, because he visits friends once or twice a week. Your cousins obviously only went to college to get their ""MRS"" degree.)

Obviously, JNMom tries to sabotage all relationships that aren't with her, and she also demonstrates her behavioral expectations for her children by shit-talking anyone who doesn't meet those (ridiculous) standards.

(And yes, she shit-talks me too, both to my face and behind my back. She's fond of """"honest"""" things like telling me I smell bad, that I'm too fat for a swimsuit, that my hair makes me look like a dyke, etc. I'm not sure what she says behind my back, but I'm sure it's not good.)

I generally grey-rock her, along the lines of ""I'm sure they're fine, Mom -\_\_\_-"". She's a narcissist, so trying to convince her of anything is a pointless endeavor, including ""you're being a dick and need to stop."" (Believe me, I've tried.)

We're already LC, going VLC as I move across the country.

This being said... folks, do you have any thoughts on the best line between information and discretion? 

I don't want to hurt people, especially my significant others, by passing on her toxic bullshit. But I also don't want to keep my mother's secrets or be complicit in her gross secret triangulation. My inclination has usually been to tell people what she's saying about them if they have any ongoing relationship with her, because... I guess I'd rather know if it were me. But... I don't know if that's necessarily the best course of action."
92,The Wedding Outfits,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb1688fd0>,likeursoperfect,0,16,107,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536031178.0,9crytc,"This is just a tiny blurb. DH and I have been reading a lot of the worst of the worst sagas. Wearing white to the wedding is a running theme here, as you know. 

Neither of us could remember for sure what our moms wore to our wedding, so we pulled out our wedding album. My mother wore ivory, MIL wore champagne. Not like a little bit, but their dresses were solid colored, my mother’s had beading, and neither of them ever wore their dresses again. (My mother also wore white to my sister’s wedding, and MIL wore off-white to BIL’s wedding, but not to SIL’s.) 

My mom and MIL compete over absolutely everything and are passive aggressive AF. It’s like a constant duel between them. MIL takes great joy in the fact that she beats my mom solidly whenever cost is involved, and my mom spends a lot of money trying to outdo her, anyway. I really didn’t think anything of it at the time, and I didn’t remember what they wore, but of course it was shades of white. "
93,T-Rex in the now (current situation),<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb73da6d8>,commentspanda,0,1,1,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536120587.0,9d2wjf,"At the moment, I am totally NC with T-Rex. I don’t reply to any texts or calls, I don’t listen to voicemails, I don’t actively open anything in the mail from her and if she does send me something it goes in the bin. I sometimes check in with DF on if she’s contacted, or to remind him of any upcoming significant events she will be triggered by, but I don’t respond to anything directed at me. I have been clear with DF I have needed significant time to consider my ongoing relationship with her. 

As Christmas approaches for 2018 we will be visiting hometown. Our last contact was at beautiful Nanna’s gathering about 9 months ago where I had minimal interaction with her and the younger members of his family worked hard to run interference and avoid any uncomfortable interactions for either of us. He has had sporadic contact with her since then (some texts, a lot of grey rock on requests for info) and has decided he will go to see her for an agreed time period of time on Christmas Eve this year as per the previous arrangement that was in place. He feels strongly that if I refuse to go and maintain NC, it is rewarding her behaviour by giving her what she wants - him on his own. There is also the added complexity of her brain injury and the lack of control it causes and there is absolutely no doubt she is getting worse. After much internal emotional wrestling, I’ve made the decision that I will go with him but have made it clear I’ll be politely grey rocking on anything personal the whole time and if she makes me uncomfortable, there will be one redirection, then one clear warning and that’s it. I have no shame in using my trauma teaching techniques on her crazy ass. The plan is: 

T-Rex “blah blah blah topic commentspanda doesn’t like such as babies, her salary, her weight, the wedding blah blah”

OP: politely attempts to change subject 

T-Rex: returns to subject 

OP: “I have attempted to politely end this topic of conversation once already T-Rex. I’m not comfortable discussing this topic and would like you to change the subject. I am being direct with you as you may not have noticed when I tried to subtly change the subject earlier. Please change it now”

If she won’t, I’ll simply be leaving. He can come if he wants to. DF expressed he felt this still rewarded the behaviour and that she would just do it every time to get rid of me. I have made it clear that if it comes to this point and he doesn’t leave with me, that will be full NC from me permanently. No take backs. I’ve tried to explain it’s not a judgment on him - if he truly feels I’m overreacting by leaving then he needs to make his own decision and I won’t be upset with him if that decision is to stay - but that will be the end for me. I’ve reached as far as I can go in terms of civil contact. She’s his mother and he loves her and she’s unwell - I get it, and I fully support any decision he makes and he can manage her with his own strategies from that point onwards. DF has come around to this approach as he feels if we get to the point where I do give the verbal back-the-fuck-off warning, one of two things will happen:

- She will freak out that things are going badly and rapidly back track to save face and make sure her baaaaaby doesn’t leave early
- She will lose her shit at the statement and he will leave with me at that point anyway because crazy a T-Rex is not a rational T-Rex

Personally, I am far more confident in my ability to handle her these days. For the last year I’ve worked in a high stress environment and am regularly dealing with escalated or traumatised young individuals....she has nothing on them. She’s no threat to me and she can’t cause any emotional damage with words if I don’t let her. 

I do still worry about her sometimes, but only because I worry about DF and the impact all this has on him. I find myself playing out possible interactions in my head (not healthy, I know) and my anxiety response goes through the roof when we talk about her....but I can clearly identify that’s in relation to the outcome for him, or for us, rather than specifically about my interactions. 

So, that’s the adventures of T-Rex to date. Writing it out has been really beneficial, it’s helped me see both the clear degeneration in her behaviour and how that had impacted on their relationship....but it’s also clear how hard I worked over the last 10 years to try and keep it civil. Thank you all for reading the background adventures of T-Rex! I assume I’ll be updating again soon as Christmas edges closer and closer. "

95,Darth Potter has returned,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb16ad710>,Peppermint_Panda88,0,24,430,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536001743.0,9co989,"It's been just over one very blissful, quiet, drama-free month since we went NC with Darth Potter. Maybe she's changed, maybe she's learning to respect our boundaries. Or maybe she was just waiting for the perfect moment to crash back into our lives. And maybe, just maybe, she decided that perfect moment was yesterday, during my best friends baby shower.

That's right llamas! Darth Potter crashed a baby shower! But at least it's a shower for people she's friends with right? Wrong! She's met this couple once, and afterwards let everyone know how ""disgusting"" they were in ""the eyes of the lord"" because in Darth Potter's mind if you're gay then you're damned, unless you're on Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. 

How'd she even get in you ask? Poor shitty timing! See, I realized pretty late into setting up  that we wouldn't have enough food, and so took it upon myself to leave and get more. I knew I would be getting back after the party started, but as my bestie said, ""It's not like anything happens at the beginning of a party! "" 

Oh, how I wish the Fates had given us a sign when he spoke those words! But there was no clap of thunder, no foreboding music, the sky was clear, Hans Zimmer was on vacation, and so I left for Trader Joe's. 

SIL was supposed to be my plus one, but was also sick. Darth Potter and SIL have very similar names. Darth Potter also looks much younger than her acutal age. So when she shows up and says she's my plus one, my friends didn't question it.

And so, when I returned with food, Darth Potter was there, joyfully announcing that her ""daughter"" had finally arrived, while simultaneously apologizing to everyone for how rude I was for being late. Then she dragged me over to meet the surrogate, whom I've known for 4 years now and started yammering on about how wonderful it is to spend time together. 

Now, I could have done the polite thing, and played along so I didn't cause a scene. I also could have caused a scene, could have yelled at her to leave. I was angry enough to do that. Instead, I just turned around and walked away. I went outside, called SFIL, and told him he had 20 minutes to come collect his wife before the NC policy extends to the entire family. He sounded really surprised at where she was, and looked pretty angry when he showed up to get her. Turns out Darth Potter told him that she was covering a shift at work, even left in her uniform to sell the act before making her way over here. 

Darth Potter, being a 55 year old toddler, threw a tantrum because I ""tattled"" and had to literally be carried kicking and screaming out of the house. I ignored her. I ignored her while she was shouting about wanting to stay. I ignored her while she was unceremoniously dumped in the car. I ignored her while she was angrily insulting everyone who looked her way. I ignored her while telling SFIL to drive safe and I ignored her as they drove off. 

I said nothing to her because the moment I saw her standing in my friend's living room, I realized that everything Darth Potter does is for attention. It's what keeps her going, it's the only thing that gives her life meaning. Everything from Christmas dinner to a strangers baby shower has to be about her, because if people are focused on her then they care about her, and if that attention ever stops then she'll be alone. And while some of the stunts she pulled yesterday were beyond the pale, if I acknowledge them by speaking to her, then she wins. But if I don't acknowledge her, she doesn't win, she doesn't lose. She simply cease to exist in my world, and I get to go on living my life.

I'm having a weirdly emotional day, so I guess what I'm trying to say is thank you. Thank you for reading my stories. Thank you for showing me I'm not alone. And thank you for giving me some great advice on how to deal with the JustNo's in my life, both by actually giving advice, and by telling me your stories. I know Darth Potter will be coming back at some point with another grand scheme to reenter our lives, and I know one embarrassing moment isn't enough to make her reconsider her approach. But I also know that if I ever need help, you guys will be here for me.

I'll keep you guys updated, and tomorrow you llamas will get to hear about everything Darth Potter did before I showed up. From what i heard, it was one crazy ride. But I've rambled on long enough for now.

TL;DR: Darth Potter decides to show up to a baby shower she wasn't invited to. I kept my cool and instead of engaging called SFIL to collect her. Also feeling a lot of love for this subreddit."
96,FMIL thinks she is now my actual mother???,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb6b0b630>,FluffyOmens,0,231,2234,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1535968482.0,9ck78m,"Hello, hi, hello, I'm going absolutely wild planning my wedding because my FMIL is A LOT. Just... a LOT. I thought I was a lot and used to apologize for it, but this woman is The Most TM, and I don't know where to start.

I am not joking when I say this woman thinks becoming my MIL means she is on the same authority/ emotional/ relationship level as my own mother. Like, she seriously believes I should love her like my own mother immediately and honestly and often INSTEAD of treating my own mom that way.  


This woman literally cried because I didn't give her jobs in the wedding planning that are traditionally given to the Mother of the Bride... because I gave them to my own mother, the MOTHER OF THE BRIDE. She threw an absolute hissy because she felt like she was being excluded from the planning and she had been sooooo involved in her own daughters weddings, so why was she not being incluuuuuded.  We're talking she wants to make my bouquet, sew and fit my veil (which is a family heirloom from... you guessed it, my ACTUAL MOTHERS FAMILY), be in the room when I put on the dress...  I literally have to remind her every time we speak that the things she's mad she wasnt assigned were assigned to MY ACTUAL MOTHER. 

This isnt new, but it's becoming very clear that it's not just jealousy, but actual entitlement to my ""daughter"" behaviors (how do you even DESCRIBE this phenomena). Every holiday, she gets angry that I spend it with my own family. She lives about 1 1/2 hours from my family, so partner and I usually separate and spend our holidays separately, and just visit the other's family around that time but not ON the holiday. This I N F U R I A T E S her. Best example is when I spent MY OWN BIRTHDAY with my !!!TWIN SISTER!!! and she yelled about how selfish for not coming to see her family on my birthday-- all of this in spite of the fact that her family \*does not celebrate birthdays\*.

She also asks me really quite personal questions about things only my mother and partner need to know regarding my PTSD and gets so offended when I refuse to answer her. She whines that she's just trying to support me, but I do not need her to support me in that way? That is actually what my mother and partner are doing, and -they are doing it fine?- She hates that my mother supports me in a way very different from her own (selfish and domineering) style, and tells me that she could help me more than my own mother because she wouldn't ""coddle"" me.

Really, I'm sorry for all the weird emphasis, but I feel like I'm in some alternate universe where the rules are all different. I just don't know what is happening. 

This is the level of this woman. Meanwhile, as she is literally expecting me to respect, obey, and love her like/instead of my own mother, she actually really doesn't like me??? I have PTSD and Bipolar Disorder, and she's literally called me childish for having flashbacks/crying episodes, won't allow me to bring my service animal around her, and constantly tells my partner that they should leave me if I ""become too much"". FMIL doesnt like my job, doesn't like my appearance, hates that I'm not religious, doesn't like my personality, and HATES that I'm pretty forward about what I need from my family/partner regarding my PTSD. AND YET?????  


TLDR; FMIL hates me, bit is also WEIRDLY obsessed with me, and it is MAKING ME BONKERS"
97,In-laws just decided to “pop in”...,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb7324a90>,Darwinian_10,0,56,559,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1535994852.0,9cn9fc,"So, this is happening as we speak. I’ve been lurking on this sub because I’m not married yet, but my DSO and I are technically common law now. His mother is a narcissist and he is the scapegoat. His brother (BIL) and sister (SIL) are both alternating golden children. (When it suits MIL). SIL basically abandoned her son (4yo), and he has been living with MIL and FIL for about 2 1/2 years, but was there a lot before that too, but that’s another story for another day. BIL (28yo) also moved back in with MIL and FIL last year, and he’s a flying monkey. They live an hour away from us. 

Anyway, on to today...DSO and I had made plans as today is a holiday, and the last long weekend of the summer. We were going to go to the beach, go for a bike ride, etc. That is, until MIL and family decided they were coming in for a visit today. DSO said to me: “you know they won’t stay long, they never do.” But he was WRONG. They showed up a couple of hours ago and brought in an uncooked casserole to put in the oven for dinner, so they’re obviously planning on being here for a few hours longer. Great. I’m already finding it hard to be around them without snapping. They brought the 4 year old with them, as well as BIL, so it’s a full house. 4yo is also a menace. He destroys everything, thinks he’s entitled to storm around our house (we don’t have kids yet, so it’s not kid friendly). MIL and FIL don’t do anything about it. 

As we speak, DSO has taken them out of the house to go play at a playground, because I told him that I couldn’t handle them being in my space and inviting themselves over to spend the whole goddamn day. 

About DSO...he is in the process of growing a spine, and MIL resents me because of that. He still has the scapegoat mentality that if he just pleases her, she’ll love him and give him praise. He says he wants to be LC, but then she pulls shit like this. We’re working on it, but it’s been hard. Every time he visits them, he comes home angry because of how much he doesn’t like being around them. 

Anyway, I just needed a place to vent my frustrations about this, and y’all seem really supportive as a community. Sorry if I got any of the acronyms or terms wrong.  :/

I’m actually thinking of putting the casserole in the oven now so that it’s done quicker and they’re outta here faster...

EDIT: I super love all the devious “BURN THE CASSEROLE” posts from
y’all haha. Amazing. However, I didn’t burn it or drop it. I let it cook. She makes terrible food anyhow. SO calls her meals “congealed slop”, because they’re always greasy and covered in cheese. He’s told her on multiple occasions that I’m a better cook than she is, which pleases me to no end. 

They just left. I hope they felt like I was pushing them out the door, because I practically was. I made it clear to SO that this is to NEVER happen again. I have told him how I feel about it. Next time it happens, I am either locking the door, or I’m leaving for the day. 

I hope they felt like I was being cold to them and ignoring them, because they were not welcome. 

Full disclosure: they technically did tell us they were coming in for the day, but it was an hour before they arrived. My SO said yes without checking in with me first, which I told him wasn’t okay. I felt bad though, because he never gets to see his nephew and wanted to spend time with the kid. I felt bad getting angry with my SO for this, because I get to see my niece a lot more often than he does his nephew. I also feel that MIL guilt trips SO about not seeing the kid though, so it’s a complicated situation. :/ "
98,So I think I found out Bankrupt Psycho’s issue with me,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfae67b908>,coconuts-commodities,0,7,70,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536034710.0,9csc05,"This whole thing makes me really upset. I’m a very easy going, calm, and also a emotional person, very sensitive to other people. I’ve never had to deal with anyone like her, so she gives me a lot of anxiety. And I generally have a hard time not taking her personally, if anyone can tell so far, 

My bf said he tried to talk to her and asked why she keeps acting like that to me? He said she just repeatedly screamed “no one said I didn’t like her, no one said that” “no one said anyone didn’t like her” when all he said was “mom why do you keep acting that way to (my name)? She never did anything wrong to anyone.”

He said it was a weird interaction. 

And then later she said she doesn’t feel comfortable and is embarrassed by herself when I am there. And feels she can’t talk (about her multitude of bankruptcies, work,  life, etc) issues. (She is constantly just angry, yelling, having a nasty attitude with her mom that lives there about these things, so I know what she’s talking about) 

1. I don’t think this is fair to act insane and nasty to me. But I do understand she is like that with everyone and has something wrong with her 

2. But I do think if you have a mental issue, or some other deeply rooted psych issue, it’s not anyone else’s responsibility except your own as a grown adult. 

3. She’s a grown forty something. Get your life together. 

-So, I wanted to ask if that little except where she said she doesn’t feel comfortable around me makes sense? Do these Narcissistic Personality Disorder MIL’s ever feel guilty or feel bad? 

-Now that she’s comfortable with me, I think she feels she can do that now. I also think she doesn’t like other women in general. She doesn’t really have any girl friends. And she’s always nasty. Which I’ve shared that theory before how she makes comments about money or vacations, etc.

99,"Cake Boss in ""The Social Security Card Debacle""",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb4a60c88>,tabletoppineapple,0,43,655,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1535988061.0,9cmawp,"Hi fam. It's been a minute. 

I made a post about CB reusing a gift bag that I gave her by giving it right back to me, learned that I apparently can't take one critical comment over the Internet, and have been silent since then. Well, Cake Boss has been silent too, so I haven't felt the need to share anything lately. 

Here we go. 
FH and I are 26 and 27 years old, but both of our parents still hold on to our important government documents. We are getting married in less than 6 months, and as I've learned from this sub, it is best to get all of our documents in a row early to avoid crazy FMILs from lording over birth certificates and preventing their baby boys from getting a marriage license. 

At the engagement dinner where Cake Boss earned her name I gave a brief overview of plans for wedding weekend, and what Roles and Responsibilities™ the parents and siblings have volunteered to fill. I made the not so big ask of ""we will need these documents in our own possession because we need them, and because we are adults and it's time that we own that responsibility.""

Y'all. I thought it went well. There were no objections, my mother told me exactly where mine were and told me to just call her up and we could go to the bank to get them together. Cake Boss said she knew where FHs were and that she would collect them to hand over. 

There is no way that it could ever have been that easy. 

Nearly one month after that dinner Cake Boss finally decided to do the thing. She looked through the lock box in their home and found his birth certificate but not his SS card. A week prior she had been to the bank to look in the safe deposit box for something else, and it had not immediately presented itself, therefore ""it wasn't there."" 

FH and I are hanging on the couch watching a trash movie and unaware of the tornado coming our way. She sends him a wall of text stating that 1) she didn't have his SS card, 2) that he lost it, 3) this is why she always asks for it back, since he is not responsible enough to not misplace it. 

I'm a problem solver, so I ask FH if he has looked through his locked box in our home or his desk just to be certain that it is not in our possession. Followed up with the classic ""when was the last time you remember using it?"" And uncover that the last time he had needed it was when he was hired five years ago. At that time he was living with Cake Boss and FFIL and fresh from college. If he had followed her ""rules"" he would have brought it right back home and turned it over to her at that time. 

He reaches back out to her to tell her it is not in our place and to ask if she is certain that she doesn't have it. 

Cue the phone call. It's a reiteration of the wall of text exclaiming his irresponsibility, how he can't be trusted, and this is why she still has FSILs docs ( she is 30 years old, you guys.) 

*DRAMATIC REENACTMENT OF CONVERSATION AS DESCRIBED BY FH*

CB ""Well (infantilized nickname) you need your SS card to get a new drivers license. You need to take a week day off and WE will go to the SS office to get a new one. You need to have the new one mailed to MY house, and then you can pick it up.""

FH ""Mom, I'm not going to make these plans until we know it is lost.""

CB ""It is lost. You lost it.""

FH ""I do not need you to go with me to get a new one. And I don't want to have my mail sent to your house.""

CB ""Why not? Why can't your mail be sent here?""

* me in a stage whisper ""because you're a fucking adult and your mail should come you your place of residence""*

FH ""Because I don't want to drive all over town to get my mail."" (Someone teach this boy not to JADE 🙄)


It continues for quite a while until she feels she has come up with a sufficient plan for HER to help FH get a new card. I'm still sitting on the couch convinced that she has it all along, and hasn't truly looked.

THE VERY NEXT DAY

She has gone back to the bank to ""look again"" (or look for the first time in my opinion) and SURPRISE; the card has been found. It was tucked into an envelope with deceased middle sisters SS card all along (remember when I said he was a replacement child in a previous post?)

I asked him if she had apologized about the way that she spoke to him. He said that he doesn't think she realized that she had done it. 😑 I so badly want someone to put this woman into her place, but I so badly do not want to be the person to do it.
