0,We apologize,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb781abe0>,ekjp,13,20928,0,False,announcements,,1436204196.0,3cbo4m,"We screwed up. Not just on July 2, but also over the past several years. We haven’t communicated well, and we have surprised moderators and the community with big changes. We have apologized and made promises to you, the moderators and the community, over many years, but time and again, we haven’t delivered on them. When you’ve had feedback or requests, we haven’t always been responsive. The mods and the community have lost trust in me and in us, the administrators of reddit.

Today, we acknowledge this long history of mistakes. We are grateful for all you do for reddit, and the buck stops with me. We are taking three concrete steps:

**Tools**: We will improve tools, not just promise improvements, building on work already underway.  u/deimorz and u/weffey will be working as a team with the moderators on what tools to build and then delivering them.

**Communication**: u/krispykrackers is trying out the new role of Moderator Advocate. She will be the contact for moderators with reddit and will help figure out the best way to talk more often. We’re also going to figure out the best way for more administrators, including myself, to talk more often with the whole community.

**Search**: We are providing an option for moderators to default to the old version of search to support your existing moderation workflows. Instructions for setting this default are [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/search#wiki_enabling_legacy_search).

I know these are just words, and it may be hard for you to believe us. I don't have all the answers, and it will take time for us to deliver concrete results. I mean it when I say we screwed up, and we want to have a meaningful ongoing discussion. I know we've drifted out of touch with the community as we've grown and added more people, and we want to connect more. I and the team are committed to talking more often with the community, starting now.

Thank you for listening. Please share feedback here. Our team is ready to respond to comments.

1,"Content Policy update. AMA Thursday, July 16th, 1pm pst.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb7e2f898>,spez,6,18129,0,False,announcements,,1436908016.0,3dautm,"Hey Everyone,

There has been a lot of discussion lately —on reddit, in the news, and here internally— about reddit’s policy on the more offensive and obscene content on our platform. Our top priority at reddit is to develop a comprehensive Content Policy and the tools to enforce it.

The overwhelming majority of content on reddit comes from wonderful, creative, funny, smart, and silly communities. That is what makes reddit great. There is also a dark side, communities whose purpose is reprehensible, and we don’t have any obligation to support them. And we also believe that some communities currently on the platform should not be here at all.

Neither Alexis nor I created reddit to be a bastion of free speech, but rather as a place where open and honest discussion can happen:  These are very complicated issues, and we are putting a lot of thought into it. It’s something we’ve been thinking about for quite some time.  We haven’t had the tools to enforce policy, but now we’re building those tools and reevaluating our policy.

We as a community need to decide together what our values are. To that end, I’ll be hosting an AMA on Thursday 1pm pst to present our current thinking to you, the community, and solicit your feedback.

PS - I won’t be able to hang out in comments right now. Still meeting everyone here!"

5,"I am a Priest in the Church of Satan. Nevermind the crazies, let's have fun and ask me anything!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb657ceb8>,Invisible-War,0,3369,0,False,IAmA,,1393866278.0,1zg23j,"Over the past several weeks Satanism, directly and indirectly, has caught the attention of the media. Lunatics are blaming the Devil for their deranged acts of violence, rumors of ""Satanic"" cults are spreading among the tabloids and fans of True Detective are searching for the Yellow Sign in satanic rituals. Peter H. Gilmore, the current High Priest of the Church of Satan, has been [a guest on CNN](http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/02/17/satanist-church-accused-craigslist-killer-not-one-of-us/), [interviewed by the CBC](http://www.cbc.ca/day6/popupaudio.html?clipIds=2438899671) and numerous other outlets (published and unpublished) in an effort to defuse a revival of the Satanic Panic from 80's and 90's. It's a shame that for many people the only exposure to Satanism is in reaction to such grim, pointless insanity; when by and large the Satanists I know are some the most life-loving individuals I've ever encountered. 

Due to the recent media exposure I'm not surprised to see several threads hitting the front page of Reddit mentioning Satanism, attempted AMA's from questionable sources, and a genuine interest in what Satanism and the Church of Satan is actually about. Obviously one can go to the Church of Satan's website and [check out the basic texts](http://churchofsatan.com/theory-practice.php) and [FAQ](http://churchofsatan.com/frequently-asked-questions.php), but we recognize that humans are social creatures and a certain level of interaction can help drive points home.  

That said, my name is Raul A. and I'm an officially ordained Priest in the Church of Satan, and have been an active Satanist for over 10 years. In my time with the Church of Satan, and well before that, I've interacted with Satanists with a wide range of interests, personalities, and backgrounds. I've organized concerts with Satanic folk bands to experimental electronic musicians. I am the technical director of [Radio Free Satan](http://www.radiofreesatan.com/). My wedding was officiated by a Satanic Priest, I enjoyed Tiki drinks and 50's music with High Priestess Peggy Nadramia, and watched Kaiju films and talked Pacific Rim with High Priest Gilmore. I've also known many nonpublic Satanists who, for various reasons, cannot openly proclaim their worldviews.   

Why am I doing this AMA? For one, I think the Reddit community is interested in the topic and has been mostly given a poor representation of what Satanism is about, in theory and practice. I've seen some fairly interesting questions go without responses, and mostly a lot of talk from people who ""read Crowley in high school"" (FYI, Crowley never identified himself as a Satanist, and has very little to with Satanism) or ""knew a guy once"". Responses are often such a bore and miss the point entirely.  

So here's your chance, ask me anything! And, like any decent Satanist, let's make this fun! Let's try things other than the usual ""Why call it Satanism if you don't believe in Satan"" (*), let's talk about life, experiences, and the pleasures of the material world! Let the games begin!  

Proof: http://imgur.com/a/wAPvz?gallery

* The ""Satan"" in ""Satanism"" refers to the Hebrew word for ""the adversary"", and that is the context in which we use it. We understand that the human animal has an innate need for religion, symbolism, and dogma so we Satanists willfully choose the one we most identify with.

Edit: I have a business call to attend to for an hour or so, I'll be back shortly!

Edit: Seems that many of my responses have been downvoted to Hell (ba dum). Here's a handy Q&A table http://www.reddit.com/r/tabled/comments/1zgfeg/table_i_am_a_priest_in_the_church_of_satan/  

Edit: Time to roll up the tent. Overall I had a fairly good time, answered a few good questions, made some new friends, and ran into some old ones. If you haven't seen my responses, especially in the first few hours of this AMA, it's because my comments were immediately being downvoted and hidden from the default views([I didn't realize Reddit were such big fans of the Westboro Baptist Church](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg23j/i_am_a_priest_in_the_church_of_satan_nevermind/cfte5pu)). See the table above or my comment history to see my responses, [which apparently is more than most celebrity AMA's combined](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg23j/i_am_a_priest_in_the_church_of_satan_nevermind/?sort=confidence#cftg9u9).

18,TIFU by destroying my girlfriend's family :(,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb631b1d0>,Ambinevolence,2,1434,0,False,tifu,,1415265547.0,2lgk2j,"I've been dating an amazing girl for a bit over a year now. She's pretty chill and progressive, but she comes from a VERY conservative protestant family. Frankly, it's amazing that she isn't disowned - her parents and siblings obviously love her very much, but every time we go to visit they are not shy about voicing their disapproval of her lifestyle choices. Thankfully they're all cordial and the concerns are voiced civilly so there's no raised voices or hurt feelings, but not being part of the family these lectures are quite uncomfortable for me. ESPECIALLY since I'm not spared from her family's criticism.

As you can imagine we don't visit them much. They were kind enough to extend a dinner invitation on Wednesday evening, and since we hadn't seen them in a month or so we took them up on it. Despite the occasional awkward disapproving interjection (which we're both used to by now) things were going well... that is, until I let slip that she and I were thinking about moving in together. At that point her father gave me the coldest gaze I'd ever seen. And he wouldn't stop fucking GLARING at me. From that point on he had no qualms about interrupting me every time I spoke, quoting bible passages to insult me or contradict every single thing I would say in some fashion. I may not have been on exactly the same page as her father before, but we'd gotten along okay nonetheless... it definitely seemed like he was just being rude, obnoxious, and particularly confrontational. Now I'm an extremely even-tempered guy, but he was bagging on me to the extent that I had to excuse myself four goddamn times during dinner because he was pissing me off and I needed to cool down. There were multiple instances where his daughter and wife would even comment on his mean attitude but he seemed to just totally ignore them. This guy obviously intended to goad me.

After dessert my girlfriend and her mother are washing dishes, leaving me and her father alone at the dining room table. After a brief awkward silence I decided to straight-up ask him why he was so upset with me. He revealed that he was wholeheartedly against the idea of his daughter living with an ""unscrupulous heathen"" (his literal words) as that pretty much guaranteed premarital sex. I'd had enough of his shit by this point and decided a dose of reality would straighten him out, but emotion certainly got the best of me and my delivery was incredibly crass. ""If you think it took more than a few weeks to twist your daughter into all kinds of kinky pretzels you can't even imagine and stuff various objects into every hole in her body then you're just being willfully ignorant."" In my defense, I was being honest... she's ridiculously kinky. I still feel bad for being so disrespectful, though.

I have never been punched out of anger before, so when this 64 year old man lunged across the table and struck me I was caught completely off guard. I'm a regular gym-goer and participated in martial arts in the past, but none of that mattered - the next thing I knew I was on my back with this previously-very-collected elderly fellow on top of me in a blood rage. Still dazed from smacking my head on the ground when my chair tipped over, it was all I could do to try and deflect his onslaught of wild blows. It seemed like a fucking eternity before his wife and daughter pulled him off me. I stood up and could feel the sting of blood dripping into my eye. I could taste it in my mouth. I was still dizzy and disoriented but it was obvious that I'd received some pretty solid blows. While I was slightly embarrassed that someone almost twice my age handed me my ass, I nevertheless felt like I won. Like I got him to snap even though he'd been working on me for hours.

My girlfriend ushered me into the bathroom and began to gingerly tend my wounds. Her mother and father were hollering back and forth incomprehensibly in the dining room downstairs; when I heard them say her name I assured her I was fine on my own and urged her to deal with her folks. More incomprehensible yelling ensued, though my girlfriend's voice now joined the chorus. Around the time I'd managed to staunch the bleeding from my eyebrow she returned with my coat and said simply, ""We're leaving."" She was angrier than I'd ever seen her yet managed to remain collected. Normally when we'd leave her parents' house there were fond farewells... warm handshakes, hugs, wishes for prosperity, and blessings abound. Not this time, though. This time there was only her mother crying alone at the dinner table; we didn't even stop to say good-bye. Her father was nowhere to be found. Nothing but silence while we got into the car and left the driveway. A few miles down the road I noticed tears in my girlfriend's eyes. I wanted to be there for her, to comfort her in some way, but I just didn't know how. ""Do you want to talk about it?"" I asked, feeling stupid that I couldn't come up with something more suave to break the silence. ""Not right now"" she said, her voice strained against the flood of emotion. I put one of my hands in hers and squeezed ever so slightly, letting her know without words that I was there for her when she was ready. She squeezed back, refusing to break down sobbing even as large, heavy tears rolled down her face. We rode the rest of the way without saying anything.

**TL;DR**: *SO's dad intentionally pushes my buttons HARD. I tell him I thoroughly fucked his daughter. He physically attacks me. Everyone loses.*

It's a common comment on reddit, and is fairly often followed up by someone explaining that reddit ""fuzzes"" the votes on everything by adding fake votes to posts in order to make it more difficult for bots to determine if their votes are having any effect or not. While it's always been a necessary part of our anti-cheating measures, there have also been a lot of negative effects of making the specific up/down counts visible, so we've decided to remove them from public view.

The ""false negativity"" effect from fake downvotes is especially exaggerated on very popular posts. It's been observed by quite a few people that every post near the top of the frontpage or /r/all seems to drift towards showing ""55% like it"" due to the vote-fuzzing, which gives the false impression of reddit being an extremely negative site. As part of hiding the specific up/down numbers, we've also decided to start showing much more accurate percentages here, and at the time of me writing this, the top post on the front page has gone from showing ""57% like it"" to ""96% like it"", which is much closer to reality.

(Edit: since people seem confused, the ""% like it"" is only on *submissions*, as it always has been.)

As one other change to go along with this, /u/umbrae recently rolled out a much improved version of the ""controversial"" sorting method. You should see the new algorithm in effect in threads and sorts within the past week. Older sorts (like ""all time"") may be out of date while we work to update old data. Many of you are probably accustomed to ignoring that sorting method since the previous version was almost completely useless, but please give the new version another shot. It's available for use with submissions as a tab (next to ""new"", ""hot"", ""top""), and in the ""sorted by"" dropdown on comments pages as well.

This change may also have some unexpected side-effects on third-party extensions/apps/etc. that display or otherwise use the specific up/down numbers. We've tried to take various precautions to make the transition smoother, but please let us know if you notice anything going horribly wrong due to it.

I realize that this probably feels like a very major change to the site to many of you, but since the data was actually misleading (or outright false in many cases), the usefulness of being able to see it was actually mostly an illusion. Please give it a chance for a few days and see if things ""feel"" better without being able to see the specific up/down counts."

Now we can get to the story. 

So this happened last night as I was sitting at home with my Girlfriend of a year. A comercial for Taco Bells new cheesy burrito thing came on. My girlfriend has some serious munchies because she wanted to go get one really badly. Being an amazing boyfriend I surprise her by taking her there later that night. We go and pick up 3 of them and started heading back to my place. Then I get the romantic idea to take her to the local lake to look at the stars while we eat. Everything was going amazing, it was nice and cool outside, the stars were out and bright. Then she asks for some hot sauce to go with her burrito. As I'm grabbing for it I realize that this was the same exact place we met about a year ago at a college party. I give her the packet and then reach for one for me. The next thing I hear is a lound scream and then ""Yes, yes. Oh god yes."" I turn around to see her in tears and smiling at me.  I'm fucking confused as hell at this point. Then she says ""Of course I will marry you!"" 

Ends up I had given her [this]( http://imgur.com/on3S4ch) hot sauce packet. She had never seen one that said this before, so she thought I had gotten them to write it on there for her. It was a very awkward rest of the night...."

While there are many legitimate reasons for us to be angry, upset, and for some of us just plain pissed off, we need to keep in mind both [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) and some general respect for not only the opinions of others, but for those who are just doing their job.

We should be focusing more on constructive feedback, general ideas, and discussion. Having the constant reposts of bashing, inappropriate and disrespectful posts and titles, and just complete disregard for any sort of respect has quickly turned this subreddit into something where [not only the developers](https://twitter.com/andrewwillmott/status/311950660964859905), but just general users have been pushed away from. Users who have posted legitimate questions about concerns, general fixes, or just some ideas for towns or actual discussion have quickly been buried in favor of posts which just follow the general trend of bashing. While this may be okay in other subreddits, I feel that this is not the kind of atmosphere we want in r/SimCity.

 Existing posts will not be removed based on this material, but newer posts which do not provide any sort of constructive feedback or general discussion towards SimCity (including excess foul language, abuse towards others, and personal attacks aimed at the team or specific people) has the potential to be removed by me or the other moderators on the team.

We're not looking for people to fix the game for EA or Maxis, we're looking for respectful reporting methods. Ex: ""PSA: The population feature is broken. It's given a false read to the user which can negatively impact gameplay"" is much more efficient than ""Fuck this game, everything is lying to us this piece of crap"" Posts that are pure bashing or don't offer any sensible advice will be deleted.
* Only posts that are directly related to the game, thus excluding general EA bashing, Origin bashing and other things that only attract hate.
* **Absolutely NO personal Information.** This is not only a rule of the subreddit, but of [Reddit itself](http://www.reddit.com/rules).

(These rules are holding here for the time being until we can get the subreddit back on track. These points and the general works of the subreddit will be placed up for public discussion where we can all vote and rule out things that we want/don't want to see. Until then, please follow these posting guidelines.)

We will soon be updating the sidebar with some more posting guidelines to help narrow down what we are looking to filter out. While we understand anger due to the new game and behavior that we have received from EA, Origin, and SimCity, we need to understand there are those who are just doing their job and really have no control over the outcome of your conversation with them (obviously this is not the case for all). While posting here, we are going to request some respect from you as a Subreddit. There is plenty of content offering excellent feedback and constructive criticism towards the game – which is exactly what we want.  

So we’ve all had our fun, but it’s time we get SimCity back on track. Many users have been reporting abusive posts and messaging the mods about questionable content - It’s important to understand that we take every report and message and read through it thoroughly. Thanks for taking the time to read through and feel free to comment below. "

My wife and I have just had our third wonderful child. Not wanting a fourth, we agree I should get a vasectomy. No big deal: just a little snip and removes all the worries with contraception.

My doctor didn't seem to understand why I wanted it, but I quickly dismissed him, insisting I had thought hard about what I wanted and was not going to change my mind. Same with the consultant. I sign the papers and the operation is booked.

A few weeks later, after I wake up from the operation, everything feels fine but numb. Consultant gives me some strong warnings about being careful with my penis over the next fortnight, but I don't take it too seriously.

After my wife has driven me home, we take off my trousers to take a look at the scrotum scar. The head of my penis is wrapped in a soft bandage. She removes it and screams. I look down. It is covered in blood and we can't find my foreskin. Scrotum seems normal.

After we calm down, wife fetches my papers. Turns out I had booked myself in for a circumcision, not a vasectomy. Not their fault: my wife remembered me getting the words confused a few times over the past weeks as well.

Recovery was unpleasant. For a week, woke up every few hours in the middle of the night, somewhere between screaming and crying because the stitches were being stretched. Could not walk properly. Penis looks like someone else's. Two weeks after the operation, I am only just getting anywhere near back to normal. My boss is not impressed either.

And I need to go back to pay for the vasectomy I wanted in the first place.

Tl;DR: Meant to get a vasectomy, got two words confused, didn't listen to warnings, lost my foreskin."

Tanya quickly became a popular performer in the MILF genre. When the Liverpool born beauty starred in the controversial Tanya Tate’s Sex Tour of Ireland, she found herself spotlighted in the headlines of the mainstream press. A sex scene that featured Tanya and an Irish pro-athlete became tabloid fodder across England and Ireland. Capitalizing on her skyrocketing career, Tanya ventured to the adult entertainment capital of the world; Los Angeles. There, Tanya began filming for top tier adult companies such as Digital Playground, Vivid, Wicked Pictures and Brazzers. Tanya has also been an FHM magazine cover model and seen in the theatrically released documentary, Aroused, from acclaimed photographer Deborah Anderson. She was seen across the UK in Channel 4’s nationally broadcast reality program Date My Pornstar. After firmly establishing herself as an in-demand performer, Tanya made the move to the director’s chair, specializing in lesbian-themed erotica for Filly Films.

35,Wave of Violence in Israel and the Palestinian Territories,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb77383c8>,WorldNewsMods,0,1352,0,False,worldnews,,1445909971.0,3qd2ek,"There has been a recent wave of violence in Israel and the Palestinian territories.  Treating every stabbing incident as major world news has the drawback of the topic dominating the front page, drowning out other stories and spreading out discussion across several threads. Trying to select major incidents over minor ones is bound to lead to inconsistent decisions with such rapidly developing stories. Hence we believe a collective thread for all violent incidents is the best approach.  Users are encouraged to submit posts conveying recent developments in the comments section of this sticky thread.  Moderators will periodically review the comments and update this post with recent events.  **Top level comments must be links to news.**  All other submissions about these incidents will be removed.  

As a reminder, please be mindful of the [subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/wiki/rules) when posting.  We'd like to remind you that calling other users shills, apologists, racists, islamophobes or antisemites are all considered personal attacks and thus against the rules.  Please discuss the issues and the comments made, not the persons making them.  If you find comments which violate our rules, you’re encouraged to use the report button or alert the mods via modmail so that we can investigate.

Thank you,

The World News Team.

Not just on July 2, but also over the past several years. We haven’t communicated well, and we have surprised you with big changes. We have apologized and made promises to you, the moderators and the community, over many years, but time and again, we haven’t delivered on them. When you’ve had feedback or requests, we have often failed to provide concrete results. The mods and the community have lost trust in me and in us, the administrators of reddit.

Today, we acknowledge this long history of mistakes. We are grateful for all you do for reddit, and the buck stops with me. We are taking three concrete steps:

**Tools**: We will improve tools, not just promise improvements, building on work already underway.  Recently, u/deimorz has been primarily developing tools for reddit that are largely invisible, such as anti-spam and integrating Automoderator. Effective immediately, he will be shifting to work full-time on the issues the moderators have raised. In addition, many mods are familiar with u/weffey’s work, as she previously asked for feedback on modmail and other features. She will use your past and future input to improve mod tools. Together they will be working as a team with you, the moderators, on what tools to build and then delivering them.

**Communication**: u/krispykrackers is trying out the new role of Moderator Advocate. She will be the contact for moderators with reddit. We need to figure out how to communicate better with them, and u/krispykrackers will work with you to figure out the best way to talk more often.

**Search**: The new version of search we rolled out last week broke functionality of both built-in and third-party moderation tools you rely upon. You need an easy way to get back to the old version of search, so we have provided that option. Learn how to set your preferences to default to the old version of search [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/search#wiki_enabling_legacy_search).


I know these are just words, and it may be hard for you to believe us. I don't have all the answers, and it will take time for us to deliver concrete results. I mean it when I say we screwed up, and we want to have a meaningful ongoing discussion.


Thank you for listening. Please share feedback here. Our team is ready to respond to comments."

Hey guys... So much fun answering some of your questions.. wish I had more time, wish i could type faster.. but yeah... was fuckn fun! big ups to all of you.. Thanks for the support... It was dope getting some good feedback. As an artist (im sure some of you producers can agree with this) you have to go with your gut,. you have the try new things.. you have to fuck up sometimes! Thats one of the best parts about trying something new... Sometimes it works, sometimes it does. But you ALWAYS learn. My career is still young.. i've still got so many records in me and so many different outlets and ways I want to create music. But i think my biggest inspiration for when I make music as skrillex, is always thinking about playing live, because I like playing shows and meeting cool ppl like you... hope to see ya'll this summer! BIG UP!"

Treating every stabbing incident as major world news has the drawback of the topic dominating the front page, drowning out other stories and spreading out discussion across several threads. Trying to select major incidents over minor ones is bound to lead to inconsistent decisions with such rapidly developing stories. Hence we believe a collective thread for all violent incidents is the best approach.  Users are encouraged to submit posts conveying recent developments in the comments section of this sticky thread.  Moderators will periodically review the comments and update this post with recent events.  **Top level comments must be links to news.**  All other submissions about these incidents will be removed.  

As a reminder, please be mindful of the [subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/wiki/rules) when posting.  We'd like to remind you that calling other users shills, apologists, racists, islamophobes or antisemites are all considered personal attacks and thus against the rules.

70,TIFU - Shark Touch Tank Accident -NSFW,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb58d9048>,dick_thrownaway,1,268,134,False,tifu,,1469911352.0,4vdw36,"So to start with, here's the obligatory ""this actually happened about 4 weeks ago"". Using a throwaway because some people here know me.

4 weeks ago, it was a friday night, I had just turned 19 and my friends and I were going to go spend the night partying to celebrate. One of my best friends works at the local aquarium and the plan was to meet up with him there after he got off from work.

So we get there around 8 pm after the place has closed and he says we can chill out inside while he finishes a few last things. The aquarium has one of those touch tanks where you can pet stingrays and other cool sea critters so we hung out there while we waited for him.

Now I had been to other aquariums before and seen touch tanks but this one was definitely unique. It was very large and has a ton of different species. Everything from hermit crabs to flounder to even a few small sharks. We started poking everything we could, probably giving half the creatures PTSD but once we saw the small sharks we forgot about everything else. There were two. Each was about 2 feet long. They were swimming around in slow circles like sharks do, like they were hunting for something.

Interestingly, they didn't really react when we touched them. They just kept on swimming as if nothing had happened. So since they weren't reacting that much, we started daring each other to do crazier and crazier things to see if they would react. This is where things went wrong. I should probably add that we had pregamed a little so we weren't completely sober.

It started with one of my friends tangling his hand in front of the shark, first for just a instant and then for longer and longer. Then my other friend upped the anti by sticking his tongue in the water. This guy is probably the craziest guy I know. About 5 years ago we used to be really close but we have since drifted apart. But for old times sake, I had called him up the day before and asked him if he wanted to hang out.

So what was so crazy about sticking his tongue in the water? Well he had just gotten it pierced that afternoon and it was still a little bloody.

Now, I know you probably now think you know where this is going, but I promise, you don't.

So he sticks his bloody tongue in the water and the sharks IMMEDIATELY stop their slow circles and start heading his direction. We all start yelling at him to get his tongue out, but he's just laughing maniacally like the joker and tonguing the water like its a girl. He waits till the last instant, till the sharks are about a foot away and then he stands back up. He then looks at me and said something like ""your turn!""

Well I had just been called out. Any other time, I would have laughed at the ridiculous of the situation and gone to see what was keeping my friend but like I said, we had been pregaming and I was not thinking straight.

So I did the only thing I could think of to top that. I waited till the sharks had swam a little ways off, unzipped my pants and dropped my dick in the water. Your birthday, in front of your friends, is not the time to start acting like a pussy right?
So I kind of twirl it around in the water, waiting for the sharks to circle back around and get close. My friend has waited till they were a foot away, so I felt I needed to wait till they were maybe 8 inches away.

My dick is kind of stirring of the bloody water and the sharks sense this and start heading back. They get closer and closer. Suddenly, when they're about 15 inches away, my other friend who were waiting on walks back in. In that instant, I looked up and the sharks lunged for my dick. One shark actually ended up biting into the first one, but the first one got almost its whole mouth around my dick.

I won't go into the gory details except to say that I had always heard on TV that shark's teeth are curved backwards to make it impossible for prey to escape and the TV was not lying.

At the hospital, my foreskin was so shredded that they ended up just cutting it all off.

Four weeks later, [this is what my dick looks like](http://imgur.com/a/nbESD)(3 pictures)

TL;DR: Get drunk and stick dick into shark touch tank at aquarium. Dick gets bitten by shark while distracted. "

I have developed a web-based training program targeted at college-aged men that has been found to be effective in reducing sexual assaults and increasing the potential for bystanders to intervene and prevent such attacks. I’m also working on a version aimed at college-aged women. I research the factors that lead to sexual violence on campuses and science-based efforts to address this widespread problem. I also research efforts to improve the sexual health of adolescents and adults, who are at heightened risk for sexually transmitted infections and HIV.

Godot: The Game](http://www.unburntwitch.com/godot.html), tell weird jokes on twitter, mess around with
biohacking, and write books - my memoir will be out next year and is
being turned into a movie by Pascal Pictures. I most recently worked on the expansion for [Betrayal At House On The Hill: Widows Walk](https://www.amazon.com/Betrayal-House-Hill-Widows-Board/dp/B01EOA7Y1O). I've spoken at the UN
and the House of Representatives about online abuse after I became
someone that the internet had extremely strong opinions about, but
that subject has been talked to death at this point, especially compared to the gyrating unicorn butt cops. Let's talk!

Edit: Thanks to all who participated and asked good questions (even some of the challenging ones that got downvoted that I tried to answer anyway if they seemed legit!) Be good to each other and PROVE LOVE IS REAL!! I need to go back to the Sexy Vampire Night Bus Mines and hope to create cool stuff that leaves you with even more questions. Bye for now!"

94,What is happening in this subreddit?,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb0a62c88>,tnvb,0,394,3,False,apple,,1477745038.0,5a09xt,"I am fairly used to the overbearing amount of troll negativity on this thread, but since this August 27^th event, it has been just stupid. The first day after, I scrolled down the entire first page of submissions, and not one substantive or even neutral submission could be found. I think that's pretty sad, because hate or love what they did, it certainly warrants an interesting discussion. 

Here are some of the genius points that made it to the top of the heap: 

* **I cannot plug my iPhone 7 into my new MBP:** That is as relevant as saying I cannot put my diskette into my electric shaver. That is neither mind boggling nor weird. The last phone that needed to be plugged into a computer was the iPhone 3G.

* **Apple priced me out, I am switching to Microsoft and getting a Surface Studio:** Never mind that Apple was always on the upper end of expensive, this one is truly mind numbing. First, inflation adjusted this is far from the most expensive MBP Apple has offered, but that is not even scratching the surface. The cost of ownership of Apple laptops has been shown over and over to be very competitive. Lower maintenance costs, high life expectancy and high residual values actually have made Apple laptops often cheaper than much of the competition during the time of ownership. And just as a side comment, the Surface Studio is more expensive than a MacPro, like twice as expensive than a 5K iMac and makes the new MBP look like Apple priced it to compete with the Raspberry Pi. 

* **Touch Bar is like the most gimmicky thing ever:** These must be the same people that complain about touchscreen phones. I mean it is just astounding that in 2016 people violently defend the notion of static function keys over an intelligently adaptable, multi touch screen. When I type a Zip code on my iPhone, I am glad when I get the NumPad keyboard and **NOT** the QWERTY, and on the flip side, I still get mad when I have to type in my credit card number and get the QWERTY keyboard. It's annoying. That is why digital keyboards on smartphones are genius. Smartphones can display the appropriate keyboard for the task! That makes sense and very shortly after 2007 has become the universal standard. If you want to go back to a BlackBerry Pearl (not a bad phone, by the way) you can, but I like multi-touch screens with adaptable software that uses the bottom 50% of my phone more intelligently than simply having static, plastic keys like in an old ass BlackBerry that can never change, and never adapt to anything. This is no different with TouchBar. Sure, typing is better on a physical keyboard, at least until haptic feedback is a little more advanced, but the function keys are surely an obvious place to start reclaiming a lot of real estate and making it smarter. It's not quite like reclaiming the bottom 50% of BlackBerries back in the day, but that is still a large strip of computer that is now inarguably superiorly used. You can still have the TouchBar mimic your old, static function keys, but to also make it this totally adaptable interface for the software you are using is actually really smart and the demos only showed a first attempt of what developers could do with it. This technology will absolutely make life easier and better. 

* **Nothing in Apple integrates anymore, nothing just works:** The usual example cited is that you need a dongle for something. I mean in a time when I can start writing an email on my iMac, continue on my iPad when going to the bathroom thanks to continuity, copy a relevant picture I find on my iPad, paste it back into the email on my iMac after my defecation without skipping a beat and in the meanwhile iCloud has synched every file, every contact, every Wifi password, every other password, my calendars, to-do lists, photos, videos, music, and made freakish backups of all of my devices that even restore the very website I was on to find that picture while pooping with my iPad should I have accidentally dropped the iPad into the toilette and destroyed it, requiring a new purchase, the statement that nothing works together in the Apple ecosystem anymore is just wonderful. 

There, I put into a million words what I have been thinking about this subreddit for a while now. Not sure what I tried to accomplish, but I feel better."
