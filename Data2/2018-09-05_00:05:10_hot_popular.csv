2,A good friend and neighbor recently passed away and left me 5% of his surprisingly large will. Now his adult son is suing me (Virginia).,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb37709e8>,Iron__Maiden,0,230,11799,False,legaladvice,,1536067853.0,9cvmf2,"So basically, I lived next door to my neighbor for around 5 years. He was a widower in his early 60s, and we quickly bonded. We watched football together, drank together, and all that. I even went to his church every now and then, even though it's not my bag. The point, I guess, is that even though he had 30 years on me, we were friends. I think this point is important.




He recently passed, which sucks. Then I learned he left me a little something. That little something turned out to be just over $40,000, which nearly knocked my dick off since I had no idea he had that kind of money. That 40k, though a lot of money, was ""only"" around 5% of his net worth. So it's not like I'm getting the majority of his estate. But then his son, who I'd met a couple times, sued me (as of yesterday), claiming that  I ""took advantage"" of his elderly father. 




I have three things going for me:




1. My friend was mentally acute. He had his share of health problems (pack-a-day smoker), but none of them were mental.




2. Our town's not big, and I know people who can attest to the fact that we went to the bar and church and watched football together, proving that we actually had a relationship. Hell, I even mowed his lawn, which our neighbors can attest to. These people can be witnesses I think, though I don't know how civil suits work.


3. His adult daughter is a very nice lady, and has no problems with her dad leaving me some of his estate. She came around from time to time, and knew her dad and I hung out and stuff. The first time I met her, her dad and I were watching college football in our robes while sitting on my porch and drinking beer (we live in the South so that's acceptable behavior for grown men). 





Basically, my point is he and I were friends, and does the son have a pot to piss in regarding this lawsuit? Also, what kind of lawyer should I hire? The lawyer who did his will seemed like a straight shooter, but I don't know if me hiring him is a conflict of interest or if he's even the right kind of lawyer to represent me.





Edit: You guys were right. The son's contesting the will, not suing me directly. The letter had a bunch of legal terms, so I didn't get the gist when I first read it. I'll be contacting a lawyer ASAP."

We were like, ""Cool, so much traffic, this means we're going to turn a profit for this business,"" but we didn't see the increase in business.  We learned about the hosting tools available for our site and found that there was a NYC/NJ boxing federation that was using a ton of our images and they must have been tremendously popular because the volume was amazing.  Way more than the sum of all our other traffic combined by 10x. 

their hosting theft centered on about 4-5 images - a Mills Lane image, a Deebo image from Ice Cube's Friday's movie, and a few others, but when visiting their site, Mills Lane and Deebo were on every single page.  every page.  we got charged hosting downloads for every page people viewed for this boxing business.  I signed up for a membership to their forums and saw our images all over the place - headers, avatars, etc.  The headers were sloppy web design - they didn't make a banner for their site, they used an html table that directly downloaded from other sites so they wouldn't be charged the volume for downloads from their host.  Since we were hosting, we were paying.  I saw from the hosting reports that traffic was picking up, and according to their site, it was because they were doing a big event in a week.

my partner wanted to delete the images and make their page look like crap, but i saw a bigger opportunity there.  I was like, this is a boxing site, what would be the worst things to replace their site with?  I went to the San Fran Pride Parade images and resized some of the most choice and flamboyant pics down to the pixel height and width of our photos and mocked it up.  Over the top parade floats, men embracing and kissing in downright dirty ways - ways that would be considered obscene for men and women to be doing if roles were changed, it was so ""in your face"", especially considering the intended audience of boxing fans.

we watched traffic increase and when tickets information went up and the billing was set - we changed our images on a Friday at 5:00pm EST to ensure they had no way to get the site changed over the weekend.  The best thing of all was the forum's response when mods avatars changed and the main page offended the members.  People talked about skipping the event, getting refunds on their tickets, and the crowds reported in the forums had decreasing attendance as time went on.  It was awesome.  Monday around 10am, our hosting volumes returned no normal."
