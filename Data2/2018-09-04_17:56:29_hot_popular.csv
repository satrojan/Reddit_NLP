1,A good friend and neighbor recently passed away and left me 5% of his surprisingly large will. Now his adult son is suing me (Virginia).,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb1129d30>,Iron__Maiden,0,229,8164,False,legaladvice,,1536067853.0,9cvmf2,"So basically, I lived next door to my neighbor for around 5 years. He was a widower in his early 60s, and we quickly bonded. We watched football together, drank together, and all that. I even went to his church every now and then, even though it's not my bag. The point, I guess, is that even though he had 30 years on me, we were friends. I think this point is important.




He recently passed, which sucks. Then I learned he left me a little something. That little something turned out to be just over $40,000, which nearly knocked my dick off since I had no idea he had that kind of money. That 40k, though a lot of money, was ""only"" around 5% of his net worth. So it's not like I'm getting the majority of his estate. But then his son, who I'd met a couple times, sued me (as of yesterday), claiming that  I ""took advantage"" of his elderly father. 




I have three things going for me:




1. My friend was mentally acute. He had his share of health problems (pack-a-day smoker), but none of them were mental.




2. Our town's not big, and I know people who can attest to the fact that we went to the bar and church and watched football together, proving that we actually had a relationship. Hell, I even mowed his lawn, which our neighbors can attest to. These people can be witnesses I think, though I don't know how civil suits work.


3. His adult daughter is a very nice lady, and has no problems with her dad leaving me some of his estate. She came around from time to time, and knew her dad and I hung out and stuff. The first time I met her, her dad and I were watching college football in our robes while sitting on my porch and drinking beer (we live in the South so that's acceptable behavior for grown men). 





Basically, my point is he and I were friends, and does the son have a pot to piss in regarding this lawsuit? Also, what kind of lawyer should I hire? The lawyer who did his will seemed like a straight shooter, but I don't know if me hiring him is a conflict of interest or if he's even the right kind of lawyer to represent me.





Edit: You guys were right. The son's contesting the will, not suing me directly. The letter had a bunch of legal terms, so I didn't get the gist when I first read it. I'll be contacting a lawyer ASAP."

While waiting they began to wonder; Could they possibly get married in Heaven?  
When St. Peter arrived they asked him if they could get married in Heaven.  
St. Peter said, 'I don't know. This is the first time anyone has asked. Let me go find out,' and he left.  
The couple sat and waited for an answer.... for a couple of months.  
While they waited, they discussed the pros and cons. If they were allowed to get married in Heaven, should they get married, what with the eternal aspect of it all?  
What if it doesn't work? Are we stuck in Heaven together forever?'  
Another month passed. St. Peter finally returned, looking somewhat bedraggled.  
“Yes,' he informed the couple, 'You can get married in Heaven.'  
'Great!' said the couple. 'But we were just wondering; what if things don't work out? Could we also get a divorce in Heaven?'  
St. Peter, red-faced with anger, slammed his clipboard on the ground.  
'What's wrong?' asked the frightened couple.  
'OH, COME ON!!!' St. Peter shouted. 'It took me 3 months to find a priest up here! Do you have ANY idea how long it'll take to find a lawyer?”

58,TIFU by posting on Reddit,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb52a74e0>,The-Co-Commentator,0,281,6113,False,tifu,,1536065658.0,9cvbz2,"I’ve long wanted to tell this story because Reddit is part of the story and to that end it is something of a cautionary tale, but until I retire from this industry, this could still come back to bite me. So in order to tell it, I have to be vague (the full details are really, annoyingly juicy) and use a throwaway for, as you will find out, some people are very good at scouring through Reddit comments...  
    
Back in 2014 I was working for a big company, where I had been for just shy of 12 years. My job was on the way out because of automation but I was fine with this, it was time to move on. My company, however, were treating me and my team like pieces of shit, and as the team manager, I wasn’t letting them get away with fucking my guys about. This made me unpopular with senior management. 

One day I was called into a room and told my job was being changed dramatically. I argued that they were trying to avoid paying me my severance as stipulated in my contract (would've been about $60k) by making me so bored I’d quit. I demanded to see a new job description so I knew for sure what they expected me to do in my 40 hour week (my job was now taking 3-4 hours a week to do) and made it clear I was considering legal action (another mistake, I soon realized). 

I was sitting pretty, I felt. I was keeping my nose clean and waiting for the severance offer. I even called a meeting with my team to warn them that the company would do anything to get rid of us long-termers on the cheap.  Don't give them an excuse, I said. Little did I know, I already had... 
  
Because I was so bored all the time I was spending more and more time on Reddit. On one occasion, about two months before this kicked off, I came across a big discussion about a product that I knew a fair bit about. So I joined the conversation, defending the product and explaining that, based on some meetings I’d attended with this company, the product is going to be way better than these guys realize by the time it gets released to the public. 
    
So a few days after the initial job-change meeting, I get invited to another meeting, and on this occasion my manager pulls out some print outs featuring comments from my Reddit account. It turned out that the company who were developing the product regularly searched Reddit for stuff about them, had seen what I’d said, gone through five years worth of comments and figured out where I worked.  
    
Normally, this wouldn’t have been a huge deal. My old managers would have slapped me about and then told senior management it was taken care of. But those guys were long gone, and the management I now answered to really didn't like me or my team, and wanted to save $200k a year by getting rid of us. 
  
The Reddit comment was positive and didn’t reveal any secrets, so this company were keen for me to delete it and leave it at that, but my employer saw an opportunity to avoid paying my severance, and launched a full investigation - but they sucked at investigating, and were unable to conclusively prove I’d written any comments at all. 
  
But they tried. They found all sorts of comments from several accounts that they tried to attribute to me, but none of it stuck (and most of them had nothing to do with me, the guy investigating really didn't understand Reddit at all). The investigation lasted for nearly three months and my lawyer eventually advised me to sue. So the company had to offer me a settlement or face the whole thing going to court. 
  
I wanted to go through with the legal action as we all knew it was a witch hunt by now, but I was acutely aware that if they found evidence that I used that Reddit account, I would be on shaky ground. Friends and family convinced me to take the offer, so I accepted it and moved on with life, albeit about $20k down overall. 
  
TL:DR - I fucked up by posting about work on Reddit, my employer used it to try and fire me, I lost out on severance package, recovered some of it by threatening to sue.
