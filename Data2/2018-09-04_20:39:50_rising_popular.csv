**KALTERKRIEG ~~1,000~~ 1,200 SUBS MILESTONE**

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

I’m tapping my keys incessantly, on an evening where the clouds have done nothing but rain and my window done anything other than show me the beauty, or dreariness, of the outside world. One of the keys have stuck down, the signs of ailment, but I don’t care. I press it anyway. Again and again -- 

&nbsp;

A notification.

&nbsp;

Discord’s numerous notifications and pings always got the better of me. Excitement, ecstasy at my fingertips, only to reveal the dreariness of a dead chatroom. But I clicked anyway. I always clicked. It was . . . oh, it . . . who? Who was this?

&nbsp;

Bob. I knew that name. Somehow, somewhere, I’ve heard of him before. And he was on my friends list, but I don’t recall . . . Nachkrieg. A project I had helped out with, promised to code for, but never learnt how to. Typical. He wanted to know about if I was still on the old server. It was dead long ago. But, I was looking for something new to type for and waste my time caring about, so why not find it again? I hunted, and found a link to this dead Discord.

&nbsp;

There was only one real person taking it seriously when I joined. Chroma. Another remnant of Nachkrieg, but when I joined, I felt something new come over me. The chaos of the past was over, and now, a pea rolling off a plate, we were on our own trajectory. I didn’t have to wait for someone else to do things for me. This was my opportunity.

&nbsp;

Fast forward four months later and a subreddit that didn’t even exist has now steadily grown to something that nobody could have predicted. We’ve piggybacked on something that already exists, like an annoying tick, but we’re a big tick now. Wow, that sounds uplifting when I say it like that. Imagine that. Kalterkrieg: We’re a big tick now.

&nbsp;

Everything that we have done in the past four months is build the foundations of something successful, a system and an ethos that can carry us to that far-away and fabled 0.1. We’re not the first mod set in this universe - hell, we’re not even the first Kaiserreich spinoff - but we are the first mod made by this team, and because of that, it will be unique in ways nobody can predict, even myself. And it’s been difficult, to work when nobody tells you to and when you know there’s a possibility it might all be for nothing. But the friends we make, the people we meet, and the excitement we can create is all what makes the journey so refreshing. So, as I welcome you into a biopsy of the development team and a blueprint of both the present and future, I can only hope that you, the reader, enjoy it. Or you can click off and wait for some actual content. It’s up to you. 

&nbsp;

The past four months have been hectic and painful, with many arguments but equally as many ‘Eureka!’ moments of pure genius. Maybe a bit more than other, sure. But we have persisted where nobody expected us to succeed, and believed in ourselves when nobody else did, and now, finally, people have begun to reflect that belief. We’re not alone anymore. 1,000 people have invested their time into us, and we are eternally indebted to that.

&nbsp;

And now, the future is near. I can feel the sparks flicker off onto my skin. That warm, incandescent glow that warms the belly and lightens the soul. Towards the glowing orb, that glowing future. Hand in hand. 

&nbsp;

-James

Vector:

I cannot even express how happy I am with the progress on Kalterkrieg. I know all content creators would say this, so it’s kind of cliche, but Kalterkrieg is special. It’s special because, like Kaiserreich, this is not only made by us, the dev team, but also, by you, the fans. Scrolling through the now bustling discord and reddit I can immediately see the enthusiasm surrounding our mod. It’s almost getting hard to keep track of, but keep it coming nonetheless. Because, I promise you, the development of Kalterkrieg is shaped by our fans. This is a mod that continues where Kaiserreich left off, and all of us have had amazing experiences with the mod, and we are here to best translate that experience into gameplay that is engaging and immersive.

&nbsp;

I just want to thank all those who’ve contributed to the mod, both on the dev team, and all throughout the discord and reddit. Your suggestions are invaluable, and if we want to create a memorable experience, they are absolutely necessary.

&nbsp;

I know we are far off from 0.1, but I promise, the dev team and notables alike are working very hard to deliver a mod with quality gameplay, an engaging and dynamic story, and an immersive world. Thank you all for 1000 subs!

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I joined Kalterkrieg exactly 3 months ago. Since then I have watched our team blossom into something incredibly unique and special. I’ve witnessed our community grow from a small community to an incredibly big and thriving one. Every time I see a new post on reddit, it brings a smile to my face, and gives me even more motivation to make the mod the best I can. 

So, thank you, us devs may be the ones working on the mod itself, but you all are our inspiration, our drive, the community, all 1000 of you, are the reason that Kalterkrieg is what it is, you are the reason why we work to make Kalterkrieg the best we can. So thank you, thank you so much, I can’t wait to show you more of what we have to come.

Micheal:

Quite frankly, it was a complete chance that lead me to wind up working on Kalterkrieg, but I can hardly be more grateful about things working out. I just happened to make a suggestion for *Switzerland* of all places that just happened to align with what Chroma, James, and Vector already had planned for it. From there I guess I was persistent enough.. And then bang. Soon enough I’m a developer in time to basically design most of the Kingdom of france. Funny how that works out. 

&nbsp;

Almost every moment working on this mod has been a treat, and we’ve got so much in store for you. History and politics are my bread and butter, and I’ve been going wild trying to create an interesting geo-political landscape for you all to explore. 

&nbsp;

Can’t wait for all of you to experience our march to the End of History. It’ll be a *blast*, one way or another.

*So, guys, we did it. One thousand subscribers, 1,000 subscribers and still growing. The fact that we've reached this number in such a short amount of time is just phenomenal. I-I'm just amazed. Thank you all so much for supporting this mod and helping it grow, I-I love you guys, you guys are just awesome.*

&nbsp;

In all seriousness, I am the newest dev of the team, so I haven’t had as many experiences with you all as the others have, however, I do know that I am glad to be on the team. At first, I hadn’t intended on even applying for Kalterkrieg’s team when I first heard about it. In fact, I might have even considered it to be “Meh”. However, as the PRs kept coming, that changed. I wanted to see how this mod flourished. I have to thank the phenomenal lore writings by James and the overall quality of the ideas I have seen for that change. I joined the team in hopes I could help make this mod flourish and be what it should become: a community favourite and an overall wonderful project. And now, I will be able to do that! As thanks for the support, I’ll tell you a bit of lore that I have been allowed to share about Scandinavia, specifically Norway. The man who has become synonymous with betrayal and in real life was known as the ‘Norwegian Hitler’ is dead. How he died is still TBA, however, his death pre-KRG startdate is now confirmed. Yall have a great rest of your week and thank you for your support!

StuG:

I stumbled onto this project like many others did, a meme. A simple meme was posted on the main KR subreddit, which drew me in and led me to subscribe to r/Kalterkrieg and to join the discord. While the premise piqued my interest, the torrent of new KR-esque mods popping into development and the fizzling out of many other mod projects like this led me to enter the community with a degree of scepticism. However, the progress reports drew me in with their quality and structure, one thing I’m a massive sucker for.

&nbsp;

 However, there was one part of Kalterkrieg that really ground my gears, and that was the Japan lore as outlined in one of the earlier progress reports. My interest in Japanese history since I was a grade-schooler led to me braving the suggestions channel and writing a massive, somewhat structured rant on how stupid the establishment of the shogunate was. After an hour or so of non-stop discussion, somehow, I became a dev. While it was awkward at first joining a project that I had only recently discovered and lacked any meaningful investment into, I quickly became enamored with the Kalter Krieg as presented in Kalterkrieg, and greatly appreciated the fun-loving, devoted, passionate, and strange dev team. While late 2018 is shaping up to be one of the most strenuous periods of my life, I’m beyond excited to contribute to and help shape this project.

somebodyelsedidthis:

I was browsing Reddit - as you do - when I found a post on the Kaiserreich subreddit, about a little mod named Nachkrieg. It seemed pretty cool I thought, only to find it had been cancelled. Crap.

&nbsp;

Except it hadn’t.

&nbsp;

 I then found a little subreddit for this thing called “Kalterkrieg”, which it turned out was Nachkrieg brought back to life, and this time, they were looking for devs. I tried my luck. I had very little experience coding, but I was a bit of a history buff, and I thought I had some good ideas, some ability to make flags and other things. And I somehow found myself in the midst of it all. It’s been a bit of a blur, but I’ve been hard at work developing ideas and storylines for all of you to go down (plus some flags to make it look pretty). 

&nbsp;

Living a whole 12-15 hours ahead of the rest of the team hasn’t made it easy, but the fact that we’re all able to accommodate each other is pretty impressive to me, and working with the rest of the team has been pretty damn cool. Apart from making flags, I’ve been working on quite a few things to play with in the land of spice - but I won’t say too much at this point. Personally, I can’t wait for us to release 0.1, and give our own mod a shot, and I hope you all feel the same.

&nbsp;

Here’s to a good one.

Finley:

When I first joined, it was out of a concern for this project. I was a little uneasy about the idea of a Japanese shogunate. I was pretty interested in this mod, but I worried that it was gonna be inaccurate and wanted to make sure. I got a response that made me feel a bit more comfortable, but then another future developer, StuG, got wrapped up in a discussion about some implausibilities with Japan, and I guess eventually I found himself in that and soon enough I became a dev! My experience here has been great. Since then I've expanded my countries and helped change some lore, and worked on a few focus trees. My experience here has been great, and seeing the communities reaction to things has been great, and I can't wait to show off my work. ^^ I'm glad to be apart of the team and glad to have made all the friends I have on it.

*Regretfully, a few of our Devs were a bit too busy working on things for both the mod and their IRL jobs to write anything here. This is simply our thank you to all of our fans from every stretch of the world, and they share the same feelings as all of us do.*

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

And last but not least there's me; the lead, the Kaiserin, and the one with the big red TBA emote; Chroma. I'm truly blown away that this project became anything more than just someone's little evil rat of an alternate history idea shoved off in some dank dark corner of deviantart. 

&nbsp;

It started off as a crazy little idea created by some Canadian dude over discord that was nothing more than a map with some very sharp borders called “Nachkrieg.” I was mostly in charge of working on the paths and such for North America, but there wasn’t exactly a Dev Chat and he didn’t exactly see me as a dev as much as I saw myself as one. Since his departure; me and James took it on and it very quickly became so much more than words and png files. But it wasn't just us who took us to where we are now; it's because of the team and the fans that this has become more than just “Oo Ooga; What if Germany won Weltkrieg but den Canada did too?” Because of the community, we as the Dev Team can keep ourselves going on the right path, and because of the company of each other I think we can create a truly wonderful experience. Not only a wonderful experience in game, but a wonderful experience within our community as well. 

&nbsp;

We can't thank all of you enough for all the love and support you've shown throughout the Rocky Road of development, but now that we've hit what is equal to 1/20th of Kaiserreich’s fanbase in subscribers, and what is more than most other HoI4 mods on Reddit; I think our confidence is more than confirmed to be placed correctly. We will continue to do everything in our power to get things out to you in an organized and fun fashion including Streaming Sundays, Wikibox Wednesdays, Flavor Fridays, Teaser Tuesdays and Thursdays, and of course our Progress Reports every Saturday. Thank you all for being such amazing fans and amazing people; keep doing what you're doing, cause we'll keep doing what we've been doing. Thanks a million, not just from me, but from the rest of the Dev Team and the people we've picked up along the way. We love you all, almost as much as the Germans love the Austrians in our explosive world of Kalterkrieg. We'll do an Artillery Only stream or something for 2,000 I guess...

&nbsp;

Onwards to 0.1!

“Wait, Freya designs your clothes?” I asked Lily in disbelief. We were riding in her car now on the way to Freya’s office after work. We had been riding back and forth together now for months. I knew Lily wasn’t speaking about the professional clothing she was currently wearing. She was talking about all her fire-proof latex that she wore outside of work, including her underwear.

Lily shrugged, her eyes focused on the road. Her car could actually drive itself, but she insisted that she enjoyed driving. “Yeah, we’ve known each other since I was fourteen.” She glanced over and smirked at my gawking. “I was a young model with a unique problem then. While I could certainly wear any type of clothing, it was just too easy for me to accidentally destroy it. All I’d have to do is get too excited, or angry, and…you get the idea.”

“So wait,” I began, trying to wrap my mind around the idea, “did you seek her out, or the other way around?”

“Both,” she admitted. “I had heard that she was working with the FRIL material in an attempt to make clothing, so I tried contacting her. When I couldn’t get a hold of her by phone, I instead tried showing up at her office, but the receptionist wouldn’t even tell her I was there. Freya has always had a lot of unwelcomed guests, given both her beauty and reputation for designing popular lines of clothing. After a while, I began losing hope, but then she unexpectedly showed up at one of my photoshoots. It turned out I was the reason why she had begun working with FRIL in the first place – she already knew my measurements since it was publicly available, so she hadn’t bothered trying to contact me until she was ready for her surprise.” Lily glanced at me again. “I cried when I saw her. Needless to say, she fired her receptionist even though the girl had technically been following her directions. I kind of felt bad about it, but Freya has always been hard on her employees.”

Hearing that made me recall all the stories I’d heard from Freya’s secretary the other day, as well as the fact that I was the reason why she had transformed from the most heinous to best boss overnight. I tried to focus on the conversation. “Huh…so FRIL…what does that stand for again?”

“It’s fire retardant industrial latex.” Lily replied simply. “Back then, it was only used in the industrial industry. The original material wasn’t glossy like my clothing, but Freya developed a method to give it the appearance of vinyl. That's why it took her so long to make me an outfit. She had to figure out a way to transform a somewhat crude material into what it is today."" She grinned briefly. ""No one realized they were sitting on a gold mine. Even though the clothing she designs for me isn't very useful for most people, a ton of women buy her handbags and other accessories that are guaranteed to survive a fire.” She smirked again. “Freya actually had me help advertise its usefulness before I got out of the modeling business.”

It surprised me that I had never seen Lily prior to working with her, but then I realized that the advertisements she was referring to were probably in digital magazines that I wouldn’t have touched in a thousand years. I sighed, glancing at Lily’s latex bra barely visible through the low-cut top of her navy-blue blouse. Every time I admired her body, I couldn’t believe I’d been so reluctant to try having a relationship with her. Granted, I knew I had reasons for that. Reasons I had yet to share with her, but I didn’t want to think about it at the moment.

Lily abruptly cleared her throat, more with the intention to let me know that she knew I was staring at her voluptuous chest, rather than asking me to stop. I grinned at her. “So, are you going to tell me why we’re heading to her office?”

She immediately gave me a mischievous look. “I told you it’s a secret.”

“Ah, come on Lily! I won’t tell her you snitched.”

Lily unexpectedly bit her bottom lip, before glancing down at my lap. “I’m not worried about *you* snitching,” she replied playfully. “If I tell you, then your reaction might give you away.” She then looked down at my lap again for emphasis.

I tried to swallow the sudden lump in my throat."

Alignment: Neutral (Killing)

Attack: Powerful

Defense: None (Basic if on Alert)

Sheriff Results: You were shot by the Veteran you visited!

Investigator Results: You were shot by the Veteran you visited!

Consigliere Results: Your target is a paranoid war ~~hero~~. They must be a Veteran!

**Abilities**

* Say ""TP LO on me pls"" at the end of each day.
* Decide to go on alert.

&#x200B;

**Attributes**

* While on alert, you kill any town members that visit you.
* It says you only have 3 alerts, but you lie about when you use them so that later in the game when you say you have none left, town roles will be baited directly into you.

I hope you guys like this new original role idea. I think it's a great role and adds more strategy in the game for those pesky Town Protectives and Lookouts.
