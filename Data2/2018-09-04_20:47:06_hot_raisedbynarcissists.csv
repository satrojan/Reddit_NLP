0,Do you care about this community? Would you like to help us keep it going? Apply to be a mod!,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfaf426b00>,RBNmod,0,59,494,False,raisedbynarcissists,Do not PM shared account.

Have you been an active user for a year or so, and would like to help make this sub a better place? We have an opportunity for you! We are looking for some people who would like to be trained to be an RBN mod.  Specifically, we are looking for people who care deeply about this community and the support that it offers and would like to help the team develop it and keep it safe.  We are not looking for folks who just want another badge. 

You can spend as much time as you like helping keep this community safe for abuse survivors.  If you have 20 minutes a day, that's a huge help!  If you have 2 hours a day, that's great, too!  It's all up to you!

As this is a huge subreddit, we understand that jumping right in can be stressful. That is why we are looking for people who would like to (start out or) be mini-mods. What’s a mini-mod, you may ask? Well, we are looking for mini-mods to do one or both of the following:

**Flair Control** - As a flair mod, your sole responsibility would be to go through our unmodded links, and confirm or apply the proper flairs according to guidelines. We have automoderator tag according to key words, but as it’s a robot that can’t understand context, it’s not always right. Many people do not apply flairs or do not know how to apply flairs as well (which is absolutely fine!) as this mod would help with that.

**Auto-Mod Queue** - as a queue mod, you would go through our queue and deal with only the items reported by our automoderator. The automoderator will report items based on key words, to confirm context or to alert us to possible drama or someone who needs extra support. As far as user reports go, you will not be responsible for this, as we will handle this.

Mini-mods are not given full mod permissions immediately, as with most jobs there is a probationary period to ensure that the new team member is an appropriate fit for the sub (acts appropriately, follows the mod rules/guidelines, etc.). Generally training takes one to two months for mini-mods but that depends on the individual, the time they can commit to the volunteer position, how much material is covered and how the senior mods feel about the trainee's progress.

If you'd like to be promoted to a full-mod eventually, that is something you can work towards.  If you would like to stay a mini-mod, that is just fine, too!  It's up to you.  

However, there is one bit that is no longer optional.  **Availability on Discord for text chat only (never video) is required.**  It doesn't mean that you must be on Discord all day or that you must answer any message to you on Discord instantly.  It just means that you should be able to check in with Discord periodically (at least a few times a week) to get updates from the other mods about what is going on and for training assignments, etc.  

I also want to be honest about what this job entails.  It is reading a lot of triggering content.  It is seeing the truly dark side of RBN that our general members never get to see, because we try to remove all that B.S. before our members have to read that nonsense.  It can take an emotional toll, but it is also rewarding.  The thank you notes that we occasionally get from members are nice.  The posts that thank the mods because the group saved their life... those are nice, too.  

If modding sounds like a good job for you, fill out the form linked below and it will be reviewed ASAP! Successful applicants will be contacted by a mod of /r/raisedbynarcissists some time in the future (sorry, no time line available at this point).

2,[RANT] NMom and NSis showed up to my home after I went NC with them,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfae865400>,sexyhappyunicorn,0,102,1044,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536075650.0,9cwre1,"Yesterday I hosted the family Labor Day celebration at my home. 


Usually it’s at my parent’s house but my NMom and Dad are separated so no one wanted to go to their house. My NMom and NSis live there and my Dad is staying with me until their divorce is finalized.


For the first time in a long time all of my local family showed up. Most of them refuse to come to family events (except funerals) because they don’t want to deal with my NMom. 



We were having a great time. Everything was stress free. 



Then my NMom and NSis walk in the gate to my backyard. My heart sank immediately.



Everyone goes silent. A few of my relatives run inside the house because they didn’t want to deal with her or NSis. My Aunt who records all family events turns the camera to them.



My NMom yells at me about how inconsiderate it was to exclude them, how much I must really hate her and my NSis, how jealous of them I am,  how she hates coming to my house because it’s always so “sterile” and she’s afraid to touch anything or sit anywhere. 



I cut her off at that point and tell her neither of them are welcome and they need to go before I call the police (my Dad has a restraining order against my NMom). They head to the gate but not before she had to get the final word. 



**She tells me she read the e-mail I sent to her about cutting off all contact. She says “I’m offended by you and how you say I’ve treated you. All I’ve ever done is try to love you and you’re unlovable. How is that my fault? He’s (she pointed to my Dad) unlovable too. My online therapist says you’re both social rapists and terrible people!”**



I shrugged my shoulders and responded “of course we are. Nothing is ever your fault. I abused myself all those years. And if you truly feel that way about us then leave and never come back here. I don’t want you to feel socially raped.”



**Her response was “I had to come since you changed all your phone numbers, I can’t reach you at work, your Dad got that restraining order on me and any e-mails I send to you come back with a message that you’re not taking my e-mails and not to contact you. I knew you’d be here so I came to tell you and him (she pointed at my Dad) I’m done with you both. If you two don’t want me to contact you anymore then I won’t. Let’s see how good your life is without me. You’re not welcome at my house ever again. I don’t need either of you.”**



I tell her “I’m good with that. Have a nice life.”



When they’re almost at the car my NSis comes back and yells to my Dad “you’ll never see your grandkids again.” My father points to my NSis’ ex-husband who says “they’re here with me. They’re inside the house playing video games. He’ll see them plenty.”



My NSis kicks over 2 of my potted cactus plants, gets scratched by the needles then tripped by the first pot she kicked over. She gets up then runs to the car crying.



We all  try not to laugh since it was so comically dramatic but it was very hard not to so we laughed.




I hope I don’t see or hear from either of them anytime soon. I still feel good about going NC with both of them. Best decision I’ve made ever. 



**Thanks to everyone on here who sent me encouraging PMs after going NC with them. The positive support has been overwhelmingly awesome. There’s comfort knowing that I’m not alone and I can help others not feel so alone since we’re all going through the same things.**"
3,Mentally Changing My nDad's Name in my Head is Giving Me a Newfound Boundary and Freedom.,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb3ebb3c8>,AnonymousZi,0,88,516,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536060421.0,9cuqj7,"TL;DR : Addressing my nFather by his name has really helped sever the already frayed emotional ties I have to the man. Now Jim is just the guy that Mom and I take care of. 

I'm currently reading the story of Regina Calcaterra and the severely harsh upbringing she endured with her sisters and brother. In the book, ""Etched in Sand"" (and her sister Rosie's book, ""Girl Unbroken""), they called their mother ""Cookie"" because she was their mother in blood, but not in any other sense of the term. 

Now, I'd never say my upbringing was anywhere close to what those siblings went through, and I feel guilt even adapting this emotional tool from them, but in the passed two days I've mentally changed the way I think of my father from ""Dad"" to ""Jim"" has actually worked wonders. 

No more rabbit-hole thinking for me of, ""Dad's mad, what did I do? I just got home, I thought I did everything right today, why is he taking it out on me? Why is it always like this? Why does he hate me so much? My chest is tightening already - I hop he doesn't pick up on that, then he'll really go off."" 

Now it's just, ""Jim's silently fuming at us? That's just Jim for you. Jim's got issues that I can't help or fix. Whatever. I have some laundry to fold."" 

Has anyone else adapted this? "
4,My Nparents resent me for being a successful and functioning adult,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb4947f60>,LittleSeries,0,29,171,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536080557.0,9cxkc2,"My family was very poor growing up. My Nfather is 55 and is a high school drop out. My Nmother is 59 and dropped out of college and hasn't had a job since the late 70's. Throughout my life they pushed me to go to college and get a degree because they said it was the key to success, but they really had no idea what any of it meant. Their highest aspirations for me were for me to go to community college maybe.

So basically I had 0 guidance in life on where to go. My parents were no help, they have no idea how the world works and make no effort to learn. I went through school and got a degree in CS. My first job was working help desk for $6 dollars an hour (I'm 34 so this was in the mid 2000's). I made less with a college a degree than without one stacking boxes at a grocery store.

But I fought and was driven to climb the corporate ladder. I self taught myself countless things, gained experienced, and then moved from job to job to gain more money. It took me 7 companies and well over a decade, but I finally became successful. I worked my ass off and now I make 6 figures working in my living room in a city I used to vacation in. I'm happily married to my wonderful wife and we have a great life 5 states away from the city I grew up in.

My parents should be proud of me right? Wrong. They call my wife and I ""snobs"". They guilt trip me for moving away all the time (they want me to live in their shit hole neighborhood with them). They give us backhanded remarks in a condescending tone like ""you're so fancy"" and ""you're riccchhhhh"". They don't even know what I do for a living or what my company's name is called. When they visit me they tell me ""I live in a bubble"" and other bizarre shit. I even caught my Nmother talking shit about me to my aunt because she accidentally dialed my number and left the disturbing shit on my voicemail.

Worst of all is that talk about my brother's job and how great he is constantly. He's 30 and lives at home and he's a janitor. They go on and on about how good his job is and how successful he is. They do this because they can control him because and thus he's the ""golden child"". Never mind the fact that he put a gun to my father's face and said he was going to kill him. They didn't press charges of course. After all this he is held in a higher regard than myself while they resent me for not being in their stable to mental illness.

They can resent me all they want, the best revenge is a life well lived."
5,Love Bombing HURTS,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb871ae48>,flare_of_light,0,19,314,False,raisedbynarcissists,Support,1536066938.0,9cvhxs,"So... my parents have been texting me recently. At first I got all excited because of course I love them and when dad text me to share an annecdote about his life I felt really happy and I missed them both and wanted to feel closer to them. 

But... when they do this, it usually means they either have bad news about someone I love or they've just given my sibling a massive present and they're messaging me to try and either let me know so I'll be hurt or maybe just to assuage their subconscious guilt. 

Anyway, following day I get mega love bombed, fished for information (they're on a pretty severe information diet) and get my spouse casually insulted by mum. Then I find out they've just bought my sibling (who they've been bank rolling at about $60,000 a year to study and not work - she's in her 30's and this is her third different qualification) a holiday to the west coast of America with her best friend because she got good grades. 

So I got proved right. Then I cried because I was right. 

Then I gaslit myself for the next three days that I'm being irrational and somehow this is all something wrong with my perception of the situation and that they're great. Thats still going on. I guess I still just want to be loved so much. Ugh.

Since I went v low contact I stopped getting cystic acne, stomach ulcers, depression & dissociative episodes. So clinging onto my improvement in health as evidence I'm not crazy and I'm doing the right thing by keeping the boundaries and the VLC rock solid. "
6,"Nparents tried to villainize me to a friend's sibling, but they couldn’t keep from acting crazy and awful long enough for it to work.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb673f2b0>,incasethisgetsugly,0,7,119,False,raisedbynarcissists,Mommy’s little villain ,1536077680.0,9cx3f1,"Several months ago a friend’s brother ended up doing some maintenance work at my Nparents’ house. I’m NC, and have been for over a year. The first day they did a number on him saying that they were just so hurt that I wouldn’t return their calls and that they bought me some expensive gift and they just wanted to talk to me. Friend gets a call from her brother that night about how maybe I had gone too far and that friend needs to reach out to me on their behalf. She says no, and that I have my reasons end of conversation. Her brother goes back to their house the next day, and apparently thinking that he’s now on their side, they spend the entire day ranting about how I’m an “ungrateful fucking bitch” and just really letting all of their crazy awful behavior hang out. 
He called my friend at the end of that day to say that she had been right and that they’re nuts. 

Now, of course this is all secondhand from my friend, but it matches their behavior exactly. She said, “I didn’t want to tell you because I thought it would be upsetting hearing about them saying that stuff about you” and my response was “That sounds exactly like them”.
I’m just so glad that someone else got to see it. "
7,I can't believe nmom sold it...,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfaea20dd8>,lucid_shad0w,0,33,124,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536072943.0,9cwcjs,"...Wait, yes I can, but I'm still mad.

When I was a kid, I was super into collecting Breyer horses (realistic model horses).  Knowing this, my grandfather offer to build me a custom barn to house them in.  He did an amazing job and presented it to me at Christmas.  It was awesome and got a ton of use.

Fast forward: As I'm moving out at 22, I took my Breyer horses with me but left the barn as it was large and my apartment was small.  Nmom at the time was storing all of my old toys in hopes that a grandchild would be able to play with them.  Nparents had a basement and even when I bought my first house it was in North Carolina and had no basement.  Believing that nmom was keeping all of my old toys, I didn't think much of it.

Fast forward some more: We move back up to Ohio so my daughter can be closer to all of her family.  Nmom start slowly giving out my old toys to her (of course, it's a little bit at a time as an ""excuse"" to see my daughter).  Last night, nmom gives my daughter all of the Breyer horse accessories then casually mentions that she had gotten rid of the barn because it was too big.  I sat that flabbergasted because that literally was the only thing I cared about, and she didn't keep it (i.e. she sold it, and pocketed the money).  


I'm still upset today.  I know it's just a thing, but it was the nicest thing my grandfather every gave me (he died in early 2013) and I was looking forward to seeing my daughter play with it.  If she would have said something that she didn't want to store it anymore, I would have gladly taken it off of her hands.  Rather, I'm assuming that she just wanted the money.  If I would have known this was going to happen, It would have been the first thing I'd have taken with me when I first moved out.  The hubby convinced me to email her about it, since it's apparently upsetting me this much.  We'll see how that goes...

8,Got fooled into thinking I could savor a few last memories with my Nmom. I just told her to go fuck herself for the last time and I won't even visit her when she's on her deathbed (she'd still be playing the victim anyway),<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb477a048>,arcanine911,0,11,77,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536078049.0,9cx5ho,"When my dad died a year ago, I tried to reconnect with my Nmom.  Fucking stupid, I know.  I've long accepted that she would never change and I wasn't trying to change her.  For some bizarre reason, I thought I could create some last happy memories with her as I was on the verge of becoming one of those people who loses both their parents when I'm only in my 20's.

I have this flaw where I try to see the good in people, and I have no idea where I developed this characteristic.  Maybe it was from the negative environment I grew up in?  Because of this I've been taken advantage of numerous times, and I'm telling you all now that I am DONE falling for this shit.  Some people are just plain fucking evil.

There were signs over the past year that she was hiding some shit, but I chose to ignore them as I didn't live there anymore and honestly, I didn't WANT to believe them.  She sold my brother's bike and pawned my grandmother's ring.  She and my enabling sister went to the social security office the day after my dad died to try siphoning money, and then had a wake for him without ever inviting me.

I knew it was money.  But I chose to ignore it and accept her vices.

Every Saturday she would call me and ask to hang out and we would; sometimes it would just be lunch and dinner, or sometimes we would take walks in the park and talk.  Sometimes she would laugh and actually listen to my stories and I knew deep down they were fake because all she wanted to know was if my brother had deposited money into my account to give to her.  If my brother HAD deposited money, she would hang out with me longer.  Otherwise, she would find excuses to leave such as claiming she was tired or had a dinner with a friend to attend.

Anyway, I should mention the most important part of all of this: my cousin ""John"".  John moved up here from SoCal over a year and a half ago to attend UC Berkeley and somehow he ended up living with my mom.  I do not know if he asked her to stay here or if it was the other way around.  

My mom and sister (yes, we talked again for a few weeks before I blocked her number completely because she was still a compulsive lying junkie) would constantly bitch to me about how lazy John was, how he refused to pay rent and get a part-time job, and how he would sleep in until noon on his days off.  As I said, I didn't fucking care as I didn't live there anymore.

But shit started affecting me as my mom would leave messages for me whining about how she needed groceries and had no food and other shit.  Since I wasn't giving money to her directly, it didn't bother me the first few times I drove across the city after an 8 hour fucking work shift just to deliver some water and random produce.  Finally I asked my mom why the fuck she wouldn't ask John to just walk across the street to help buy them shit and did she know how ridiculous it was that she was asking me to do this shit?  My mom isn't exactly disabled herself either.  We all live in a VERY large city where there are grocery stores and liquor stores mottled across every other block.  

My moms excuse was that it would be rude to ask John and that he was graduating in another year and to just tolerate it.

My brother and I have gotten along in life more than anyone else in the family and he told me he had a theory that my mom and sister was lying about John's antics.  She had done the **exact same thing** to me and my siblings to other people, all for the purpose of free money.  I decided to test out his theory.

I sent a text to John and asked if he could ""please try helping out more with groceries"" -- never once did I act accusatory or ask suspicious questions.  He immediately called me and said there was A LOT of misinformation about everything and he wanted to come clean about it.

1) On the second day he had moved in, my sister had told John to pretend he wasn't paying rent so that my brother and I wouldn't stop supporting my mom financially.  She told him not to trust anything I said and that I was ""crazy"".

2) John HAD been paying rent since the day he moved in.  He sent me picture messages of all the bank transactions linking the transfers directly to my mother's name.  

3) John also sent me picture messages of the texts my sister had sent him warning him not to speak to me, of her asking him for money, and bragging about how much ""she was ballin"".  These were antics my sister were well known for, so there was no way he could have just photoshopped them.

4) John had concerns about how my mom runs out of money quickly every month.  Apparently she was still disappearing for days at the casinos.  Additionally, John WAS bringing groceries him and taking my mom out to eat every other day; he had photos of them at restaurants with that fakeass witch smiling as I could see she was taking advantage of my own cousin..  All of this contradicted my moms whiny stories about how John never helped her ass out.

There was so much proof and information provided to me that I made *the final decision*: I was going to confront my mother and depending on how she reacted, I would cut her out of my life entirely.  Forever.

She picked up the phone and claimed she had told me everything John stated above and immediately became aggressive until finally telling me to ""just go kill myself"".  Yep, that was the proof I needed - my mother always acted like the victim when she was caught lying and playing people.  

I immediately called AT&T and cut off the cell phone bill I had been paying for her.  With all the money she's obtained from lying and stealing, I'm quite sure she's more than capable of paying her own bill.

I cancelled her name on the trip to NYC we were planning to take together later this month and instead worked it out with my husband to have him come instead.  NYC has always been my dream city to visit and I would rather go with the love of my life than a lying piece of shit.  The fees were nothing compared to saving my mental health.

Anyway, sorry for the long post but I wanted to let you all know that I have been much happier the past few days knowing I will never be in contact with this woman again.  Btw, on the same day I confronted her, she claimed she was having side pains and needed to go to the ER.  Magically, she called me from her house phone a few hours after I had disconnected her cell phone to try leaving me an angry voice message that I didn't even bother listening to.

We are all stronger than we think, and sadly sometimes we need we need a reminder to push ourselves to best capabilities but I am glad more than anything that I never gave up."

I can't recall how this regimen began exactly, but it got to a point where my nMom would lock the two of us in the bathroom at the end of the night (around 9/10 pm), soak a washcloth in scorching hot water, use it to scrape my face like she was trying to scratch old paint off of wood, then would push me up against a wall with her body weight, and use her thumbs/nails to start popping all of my pimples.  

&nbsp; 

The entire ordeal would last 1-2 hours. If I ever spontaneously yelped-out ""OW!"" or twitched my face/body from the pain, she would start slapping my arms and face because I ""hurt her ears from shouting"" or ""messed her up"". Her rationale was that if my acne went unchecked, I would develop pock marks when I was older, so marring my face for 2 hours every night was necessary to protect from any scaring. Naturally, I was too young and stupid to do this on my own, so my nMom would force this on me every night, never showing my how or why I should take care of my face, only that she knew best.  

&nbsp; 

I would go always go to school the next day, having my face decorated with bruises and scabs from all the picking. It got to a point where I found a bathroom at school that no one ever went into at lunch that had a mirror, and started to poke my face. I thought if I could do it myself, I could be more gentle, it would hurt less, and I could go to sleep earlier. When our cleansing ritual rolled around, nMom was infuriated that I ""*destroyed my face behind her back*"" while whipping me with a slipper. After that, when I woke up in the morning, she would take stock of all the fresh new blemishes and document them. It was indicated that if I returned home with scabs where the new pimples had formed, I would be severely punished.  

&nbsp; 

In science class, they would show us an episodes of Bill Nye and there was one where they discussed skin care and warned that breaking the skin could spread bacteria, increasing the possibility of breaking out. I remember feeling this overwhelming sense of relief thinking I would tell my nParents this and I wouldn't have to deal with my nightly abuse anymore. Nope, I ""*was lying*"", and if it actually did happen, a ""*kids shows don't know what it's talking about*"" so the abuse continued. It wasn't until I was a Freshman in High School that my skin got so bad I had to go to a Dermatologist who prescribed me Accutane, while having a sit in with me and my nMom, I asked the Doctor about poking pimples, and he was adamant that was probably one of the worst ways to achieve clear skin and I remember nMom getting visibly agitated/uncomfortable.  

&nbsp;

On the ride home I couldn't help rubbing it in her face, after having to suffer every night for 3 years and she started telling me how I was an ungrateful little ""*shet*"" (*nMom is from South America*) and how God would punish me for not honoring her. When I've brought this instance up as an adult, nMom gasps dramatically while faking crying, saying ""*Ayyyyeeeeeeeee! Senor Jesucristo! I never deed dat! You es lying!*""  

&nbsp;  

Sorry for my Magna Carta of an explanation, but I'm curious if anyone else suffered through similar self-serving abuse / sabotauge disguised as ""help""?"

It's the most hopeful, joyous feeling I've had in a long time. I'm trying to just keep things simple and as peaceful as possible in these last few days because when my N knows I'm doing well, she has to take me down a few pegs, and honestly I'm just so tired of dealing with that. 

Anyway, last night's dinner as disgusting as it was made me happy because this is one of the last times I'll ever have to eat meat that I know was questionably prepared. My N gets physically aggressive with me, so I have to eat what she prepares or face getting hit or having something like a knife drawn on me. You know, the usual. 

Dinner was just a pile of chicken. Literally only chicken. She only ever wants to cook a single item when she cooks, because she loves to put in minimal effort and then go on like a martyr for it. 

Normally, I cook so I have at least some control over what I eat, but she likes to cook at least once a week. 

There's a story about this chicken, because my N is an idiot and lazy. Great combo in the kitchen, right? So, we bought the chicken like four or five months ago. She let it sit in the fridge for five days before deciding that yes, we should freeze it, because we can never take my suggestions right away. So, this chicken ended up getting freezer burned. She takes it out last week and decides to thaw it in the windowsill because ""the air will move around it and thaw it very well because of physics"", and yes that's a direct quote. Then, the chicken sits in the fridge for another five or so days before she decides it's ready to cook. 

So, that was the dinner I was forced to choke down. I have horrid stomach cramps and other symptoms of food poisoning, but I've gotten used to living this way. I've gotten used to this. I'm excited that this will be one of the last times this will ever happen. I'm almost free. 

I just have to survive this last stretch and I'm out. "

I’m a long-time lurker, first time poster. I’m 17, moved out of my mom’s house about five months ago, and have been living with my dad. I left really suddenly because I was afraid of things escalating to physical violence, and I haven’t been in contact with her since (except for once, when she claimed I was making everything up, and told me I was even lying about being scared of her) . Until today, when she showed up at my school on the first day of the new school year, and demanded we go somewhere to talk.

I said no, to which she replied that she’d keep coming to my school every day during lunch and sitting next to me the whole time. Apparently she wants us to go out to lunch together once a week so she can show me pictures of from my childhood and talk about what I was like as a kid, covering a year each time we meet. I don’t know why she wants to do this, but the last thing I want is to be alone with her, even if it’s just in a car. I’d also strongly prefer she not show up at my school for an hour every day, though. I can’t do anything legally, because my parents still technically have shared custody, and my dad doesn’t want any sort of legal battle. She’s also charming, so the school staff doesn’t have a problem with her being there, and they don’t know what she’s saying to me most of the time as she talks to me in a second language we both speak. Unfortunately, my school is also pretty small, so physically hiding would be hard.

Is there something I could do to make her get bored/just wear herself out and leave? If not, what’s my best bet as to dealing with this?"

>Grandma: I'm not, though...

I don't think my grandmother is really that tired. She may be 80+-years-old, but she keeps herself busy with a few household chores like laundry, sweeping, and cooking. Besides that, she spends the whole day watching TV. The most physical thing she'll do is go for a neighborhood walk, and that's only a few times a week. So I don't think she's really that ""tired"" from being at home all day.

My theory is that my Nmom realized that because she gave that whole spiel about how kids *have* to listen to their parents in front of her mother, her mother will give her a harder time. Because here's the thing, my grandmother has actually been much more vocal about her displeasure about her daughter's behavior in recent years and has even grilled her a few times. Like, properly call her out and bring up all of her bad traits and misdeeds. And I think because Nmom said all that bullshit, her mother might just use that against her. Hence, she's sending her mom back early.

The only sad thing here is that she's sending her mother back during typhoon season, where things are always flooded and getting destroyed. My Nmom would rather put an 80+-year-old woman--who is her own mother, no less--in potential danger than possibly having to deal with said mother scolding her even more than she usually does. But again, I guess the good thing is that this just further reinforces how much of a monster she is."

""Oh it looks too stodgy""

""The slice is too big"" (considering id cut it into 12 when the recipe said to cut it into 8)

""I need ____ with this"" considering id just spent 2 hours on my feet without a break, and she just asks for more.

""Its not even cooked properly"" well maybe if youd not given all our baking stuff away id have been able to practice more, plus my slice was fine, she just had the very middle slice and it wasnt /entirely/ perfect.

I was goddamn proud of that cake, ive never made a blueberry cake before and honestly i think it turned out amazing.
I dont usually do this but i actually told her she'd upset me by complaining repeatedly about it before she actually said anything nice at all. She responded by giving vague and forced compliments about it, probably to keep me happy since im moving out so soon.

My dad is the classic 'i make fun of your sorrows and then act offended when you confront me' type of  narcissist. The classic move of his is to make fun of you relentlessly and taunt you, then, when you give it back to him in the smallest way, he ""crumbles"" and acts super hurt and upset and will go on for days about it. 

So my wife and I have a four month old. My dad and my stepmom came over to visit. My wife usually has to help me mentally prepare when he comes over, and this time was no different. We agreed we were not going to deal with the intentionally hurtful way he treats me, the way he treats me more like a ""thing"" as opposed to a human being. 

So, we have a 4 month old and obviously we are incredibly busy with her, and obviously when you have a new baby you have to make many personal sacrifices; hobbies, interests and sometimes friends have to temporarily take a backseat. 

I've been running a Dungeons and Dragons group for several years, we meet every other week. It's a blast, and I enjoy it immensely, and because of that fact my ndad Hates it, and constantly ridicules me. 

During his visit just now, my stepmom (who is genuinely interested in my life) said enthusiasticly ""I was just telling someone about your d&d... How is it going"" 

""I had to stop,"" I said. ""I don't have time anymore.""

My stepmom started to respond, but my ndad cut in saying ""ahhhhh hhaaaaaa.... Ahhhhh hhaaaaaa....it's overrrrrrrr it's overrrrrrrr"" .... Then he starts slowly singing in a high pitched voice ""it's ovvvvvverrrrrrrr it's ovvvvvverrrrrrrr"" 

We all three just stare at him, perplexed. He keeps going. Finally after another 5-10 seconds my wife goes ""what is wrong with you?"" 

My ndad continues 'singing' ""it's ovvvvvverrrrrrrr"" 

My wife shouts over him ""no one thinks you're funny, we just think you're a rude ass"" 

He stop immediately. ""Oh please,"" he says, ""it's all in good fun"" 

""No it's not,"" my wife snaps back, ""you taking pleasure in your son not being to do something he enjoys isn't 'funny'"" 

""Is this like ... A sensitive issue or something?"" My ndad says. ""because you're acting really ...aggressive"" 

""No,"" I say, having courage now to speak up. ""It's just hilarious how happy you are about other people' misfortunes. What are you, in Jr high school?""

""Eat more food,"" my wife says to him. ""So you can keep your mouth shut ""

""Wow,"" he muttered. ""Just another person I have to add to the list of people I can't be myself around. Just aaaaaad it to the list. Just aaaaaad it to the list"" 

For the next hour of the visit he stayed in the kitchen, pouting, sighing, and silent.

So this story is actually about a year old, but I remembered it the other day and decided to post it.

Now for a little backstory. I was 26, in-the-closet trans, depressed, and still entirely dependant on my parents for everything. I worked for my dad. I rented a room in my dad's rental house. My parents co-signed my loan on my car. I was securely under my thumb, and they used that to their advantage.

I had a bad habit of not getting out of bed when my alarm went off. Depression is a bitch. And this morning was like any other at this point. Laying in bed at 9AM, after I was supposed to be up at 7AM. Understandably, my dad is angry, and as he has a key to the rental, busts through my door. I really didn't wanna hear it, so I pretended to be asleep.

What followed was the longest, most painful 30 minutes of my life. Apparently I'm terrible at pretending to be asleep, or my dad is terrible at realizing I'm actually awake. He said he knew I was awake, but I still don't know if I believe him. I don't remember what he said, but a few things stuck out to me.

""Your friends are fake, they don't care about you.""

""You are not a transvestite."" (Of course I'm not, that's something different entirely. Validation, yay.)

""I declare death and destruction on those who would misled you."" (Did I mention my parents were religious?)

***""You need to cut these toxic people out of your life.""***

Oh boy, did I take that last bit to heart. I contacted all of my gaming friends to see if any of them had a place I could stay, saved up, bought a bus ticket, and three months later, at midnight, February 1st, I was on a bus travelling ten hours to Houston, with nothing but three suitcases containing my essentials.

Apparently when my dad told me to cut the toxic people out of my life, he didn't realize that was him and my mom. According to my sister, they are not doing as good.

Careful what you preach, I guess.

EDIT: I did not expect this to have the type of response it has. I should probably clarify a few things.

I left because I was being controlled by the things my parents had provided for me. They were holding them over my head. My dad is less to blame for this than my mom is, she was the one that held them over my head.

My dad is not nearly as bad as my mom, and is doing much better. They've both accepted me now, but back then, my entire family was emotionally abusive without realizing it, with the exception of my dad.

They aren't doing much better now, and I am. I don't know the specifics, except my mom cheated on my dad (for the third time, twice within the year). They're supposedly in divorce proceedings now and she's trying to get everything.

My dad had closed down his business that I was working at a few months before I left, and I was helping him flip houses, which he was trying to get into doing. He had taken out a lot of loans, and is most surely in a lot of debt now.

To be honest, if anyone is at fault here, it's my mom. She's narcissistic, controlling, and was basically using my dad, and still is, AFAIK."

So essentially I helped word, get signed and certified a recommendation for my Nsis's child, plus an offer of assistance to get employed - and that makes me the Devil! 

Two weeks ago I travelled with her to another city and took her around to an organisation where she was applying for work - but I'm the Devil!

And when, upset and emotional, I complain that Nsis daughter herself could at least speak up to defend me, seeing that I'm actually trying to help her - she haughtily responds ""I don't get involved in your issues"" and walks off.

And when, emotional and upset, I accuse my Nsis of treating me badly and being fucking ungrateful after all the years I have loved her child like my own - she spat at me twice.

What the fuck am I doing dealing with these people? What the fuck is my life about? Why does everything I sacrificed to build over the years mean nothing? Why am I falling apart?"
28,I ranted about my mentally abusive mother around a week ago. Now her ignorant self wants to homeschool me? What should I do?,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb664f518>,flocktothenews,0,1,6,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536100467.0,9d0fyx,"Let me preface this by saying that I have some form undiagnosed learning disorder, and that I struggle to pay attention in school constantly. It's extremely painful for me to even remotely pay attention for long periods of time (to the point were I'll start crying) so ever since third grade I've kind of just given up on good grades. I'm in highschool now and when I DO try my hardest to apply myself, it still fails. I failed 3 out of 6 classes last year but the school district let one of them slide (it was PE) because there's a lot of health problems in my family. My parents have hounded me about doing homework and asking questions but I just can't do it. I genuinely don't think I'll ever pass highschool, even if I do extremely well on state mandated tests and have a decent vocabulary for my age. Past teachers have said that I had the potential to do great in school, but that's more of what my parents wanted to hear and not what I'm actually capable of doing.
I would love to get help for it but my mom hates going to the doctor's, even if it's a medical emergency because ""they're paid to say stuff"". She's also antivax (my dad isn't, however), and the only reason why I'm fully vaccinated is the laws in my state surrounding them and school. She doesn't think I should have a therapist either because ""I should be able to tell her everything"". So seeking. Mental help is out of the question.
I overheard her talking not even an hour ago that she doesn't like the school officials in my district, and the quality of the schools have gone down since my dad graduated in 82. (I actually agree with her on this). 
She's right, I hate to admit. The school officials are clumsy and messed up my schedule THREE TIMES, a math teacher got fired for having breakdowns in her class and 70% of her students failed, the guidance counselors purposely pick out the students who do well on state tests to make our statistics look higher, and right now I have FOUR teachers that would rather give us packets and group projects than actually teaching us.
I'm four weeks into the school year. I'm falling all of my classes. I hate the school I go to for the life of me, but what really got to me is how she wanted to homeschool me.
Um, no. She didn't go even up to a 9th grade education and thinks vaccines legitimately cause autism. If she homeschools me I'll be more stressed out than I already am. 
I do want out of that atrocious school system though. Maybe there's some way I can convince her that online school is a better option? Help me reddit.

29,NDad tried to friend me on Facebook,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfaecaaef0>,dollface411,0,3,8,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536093209.0,9czg5u,"Edit: I’m on a mobile. Not sure if the formatting is any good. Sorry 

TL/DR: Never met my real dad, everyone who’s met him says hes an abusive jerk. He tried to friend me on Facebook, then tried to make me feel bad for him, and wanted to build a relationship, when I didnt he called me the daughter of Lucifer. 




So a little back story. I have never personally met my real dad. However I have heard probably everything about him from my siblings who grew up with him, my siblings from his side (and not from my mom) and obviously stories from my mom. I do not take what my mom says to heart, because she has some abusive traits and sometimes I believe she is a narc as well, and because sometimes she embellishes stories. This post is not about her. 
     Anyone that I have talked to about my real dad all say the same thing. He was a lying, manipulative, abusive, psychopath man who will do anything to help himself even if it meant destroying other people. Everyone says that he is also charming, and tries to get on your sweet side. Trying to say that he’s the one getting abused, he’s the one that’s the victim. And then when you show a moment of vulnerability, he destroys you. Financially, mentally and even physically. 
       For awhile I didn’t believe what people said about him. Yeah he was a deadbeat dad who left his kids to starve but surely he couldn’t be that abusive and evil? Right? Well I started trying to fact check everything and cross reference people’s horror stories of him. And yeah it all matched up. So I decided that I was finally okay with not ever meeting my dad and it turning into a wonderful relationship. I put him out of my mind and stopped obsessing over getting a good father, and hoping that everyone was wrong about him.

Well... as my title says, one day I received a friend request from him on Facebook. It weirded me out to no end. I didn’t accept it. I debated accepting and seeing what kind of person he was for myself. I couldn’t decide so I turned to my siblings from his side. They all said block him. But I guess I still kind of was curious what he was like and also super curious as to why he was trying to friend me now, after 20 years of never hearing from him trying to contact me.  So I messaged him (without accepting) and asked simply “why did you send me a friend request?”  Just to see what he’d say. And he didn’t answer til the next day. He said “is there any reason I shouldn’t have?” 

      That made me laugh. I could write a book on all the reasons he shouldn’t. Anyway I kind of laid into him about him never trying to come into my life, he missed his chance, he’s an abusive person, I don’t tolerate abusive people in my life. All that fun stuff. He then tried to tell him my mom left him (if she did, kudos to her) and that he tried to still be a dad but my mom thought it wasn’t best. You know that exact script every dead beat dad has to try to win over their kid. And he’s also saying he never abused anyone and it was my mother that hurt him. (Bull, my brother was like 6 and remembers him beating on her and the smaller kids). 
       I’m getting tired of him trying to twist everything into his favor, so I tell him I have no interest in building a relationship with him, I don’t care about him, I don’t allow abusive people into my life. I’m telling him if he doesn’t see what he did as abuse, that’s on him and he needs to have some self awareness. All the stuff I’ve been wanting to say to him since I realized what kind of person he was. 
  WELL. He did NOT like that one bit! He starts saying that my mother is a wh*re and I’m just like her, that I can’t even stop and think or reason, that I’m just like her. Calls me a total waste of space and air, that he can’t wait til me and my mom dies. Like he  really turned completely around from saying he was the victim and oh poor him to calling my mom every insult in the book and saying he hopes I die. (Real great dad material there). His last message to me before I blocked him was “goodbye daughter of Lucifer and mother of all wh*res.”  (Which really is stupid because he called himself Lucifer).

His last message made it very clear I made the right decision In not wanting a relationship with him. He did get inside my head a little bit and I did feel kind of guilty about not giving him a chance but after reading his last message, the guilt went almost completely away. 
     I’m hoping I did the right thing. I feel like maybe I should’ve given him the benefit of the doubt, but at the same time that would be discrediting all the years my mom and siblings endured abuse from him. Im not sure how I should’ve handled it. "
30,Finally told a family member about what my mom became and admitted she caused my suicidal thoughts—not being lonely up here,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfaea41b70>,reallypetitebarista,0,7,125,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536039615.0,9csth4,"My Dad has a friend he’s known since high school, who is basically my uncle. His wife acts like my aunt, and his daughter a cousin. I had work all day today, knowing they love me, I asked if they were doing anything for Labor Day that I could invite myself to. They told me to get over there. (I moved 2 hours away from my immediate family, they’re the only “family” I’m close to visit up here)

In the evening I mentioned something my mother did that bothered me, and explained that’s why I was there, I was lonely and needed to see people I loved and trusted. She seemed concerned, and suddenly it all poured out. The jokes about my suicidal period, jokes about taking medication for my mental health, the demands of me in comparison to the GC, the emotional abuse, the physical abuse, how I once went 4 months without speaking to my mother.

And then, my aunt began to cry, and jumped up and hugged me, she said she knew it was bad, but she didn’t know what my mom was doing to me. That she was degrading me. 

And finally coming from a family member who knows my mom, and not a therapist. Who loves my mom, but believed me, IMMEDIATELY, was so relieving. She just held me while I grieved for my loss of supportive mother and parents as I reached my final years of maturity. She told me it wasn’t my fault, I didn’t do anything wrong, and that I didn’t deserve it, and that I didn’t owe it to them to visit them. 

I’m not crazy, and I got a mommy hug and support like I’ve never had in years. Although I’m still scared, I’m so glad I told. "

Like I think I can handle a pushpin but whatever. Still there were plenty of things on my wall even when I moved out including a poster size coloring picture of a horse that I had diligently colored for my Great-Grandmother. I had even written on it {Dear Granny I love you double. Love [me]}. That coloring page stayed on my wall from the time she died when I was maybe 10 or 11 til just recently when my Mom took everything off my walls to try and empty out my room because my Dad has turned it into his ‘workshop’ (No never mind the two sheds full of junk in the backyard. He also needs my childhood bedroom.) She has so many paintings and posters rolled up but when I looked through them, that coloring picture wasn’t there. I asked her about it and she said, “It may have gotten thrown away. I didn’t realize it was so important.”

Bitch

Really you didn’t think this picture that’s been on my wall for almost twenty years was important? I almost started crying about it until she said, “I’m sorry I’m such a terrible mother.”

That stopped me because of course I’m not allowed to have feelings in their house. Can’t feel sorry, sad, sick, sore, nothing. So now I just desperately look for it every time I’m at their house but I think it’s a lost cause. She threw it away. I’m not sentimental about almost anything except for things I created for relatives that are gone now, or things they may have given me. I remember being so proud of myself for coloring that big picture and staying in the lines and following the pattern so that the right things were colored the right color. I remember being excited when they put it up in her room at the nursing home. I remember getting it back when she died and putting it on the wall right by my door so that I could remember those feelings when I saw it. 

But no, you’re right it was just a coloring page...why would that matter? Oh btw I saved all these Tiger Beat posters of celebrities for you..."
32,"""Trauma bonding"" vs ""healthy bonding""",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb873cba8>,hashedram,0,11,90,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536044093.0,9ct875,"[Trauma bonding](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_bonding)

 I've been reading about this concept and I think this is something anyone who's facing conflicting feelings about whether they actually love their Nparents or hate them should know.

When two people have a healthy relationship, over time they do things together and bond with each other. This is perfectly normal and healthy.

""Trauma bonding"" is a perversion of this. People who experience trauma, generally tend to bond more deeply with the person most available to bonding. This is why soldiers who go into battle together bond so strongly.

Long term abusers and especially N's tend to take advantage of this.


Step 1: The N hurts the victim and causes trauma

Step 2: The N comes back later, with a different personality and validates the victim's pain and emotions. 

Step 3: The N makes sure that they are the only available source of emotional validation to the victim and isolates the victim from other healthy sources. The victim has no voice but to bond deeply with the abuser.

Step 4: Once sufficiently dependent, the N hurts the victim again and the process repeats. Only the bonding is even stronger.

I've experienced these myself and some of the common side effects are

- Not wanting to upset the N, for fear of losing validation.
- Thinking the N will change over time and their not changing is our fault 
- Feeling that they love their abuser and hate them at the same time.

This love simply isn't real. It's an illusion. And understanding that is the first step to getting away.  And for those who have gotten away and feel guilty for still wanting to go back, it's ok to feel that way. But it probably isn't real love. Real love doesn't traumatize."

This has been something that although I knew she was an n, I didn't realize she had been doing this until recently. She really knows how to pull the wool over my eyes which makes me rage... But anyways... 

She recently told me she went through my brother's girlfriend's phone while she was here visiting for the first time. She looked through all of it, including messages between her and my brother, claiming she was worried she was going to break his heart. (Bullshit because if she's going to she will, and there's nothing a mom or anyone can do about it!!!) But that was her reasoning. 

Then just today she tells me she takes and opens his bank statements that he doesn't realize he has coming through the mail still. She tells me ""I know I'm a bad mom, but I'm just worried he's going to blow all his money on this girl. Do you know he spent over 2500 dollars on her?"" And on and on talking about how he's going to go broke and be in debt.

Do I tell my brother my mom is going through his bank statements and through his girlfriend's phone? 

The only hesitation I have, is that if he tells my mom he knows, she'll know I told him and I will be in the middle of the fire. 

It feels wrong not to tell him, but I have to protect myself too.

34,Is this... guilt-tripping? Or am I in the wrong? I don't even know anymore.,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb479ba90>,toxik0n,0,7,8,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536090254.0,9cz0fs,"I've always considered my parents fairly normal and nice people. They got divorced about 10 years ago, and since then, my dad has been dating a woman. This lady is 100% a narcissist and she's honestly a nightmare to deal with.

But I'm more wondering about my dad. Our relationship has been strained since he started dating this woman and I feel like most of our interactions are him guilt-tripping me. They both seem to place a lot of importance on favours and returning favours. If a favour isn't returned with similar commitment, I get guilted. They both act like selfless martyrs (especially the woman) - except they always expect something in return.

I'm a 30-year old adult, and yes, maybe I don't visit my family enough. I have a full-time job, a husband and two dogs. I barely see my friends once a week, let alone my family. My dad and his partner seem to take this as a personal slight.

When I do see my dad a couple times a month, there are always little, subtle guilt-trippy comments about how I don't visit often enough. Or how I don't do this or that. Usually kind of a ""woe is me"" attitude. He can be very mopey, especially since dealing with an ongoing medical issue the past couple years. 

Our relationship is usually okay, if not slightly strained by the psycho woman he's with, but sometimes he says shit that just makes me want to go no-contact.

For example, I received this text yesterday:

""It was grandma's birthday yesterday. She turned 91. It's not too late to call her and wish her a happy birthday. None of the grandkids called. She would appreciate it.""

Reading it just gave me such a mix of emotions. At first I felt guilty that I missed my grandma's birthday. And I ended up going to visit her today.

But now that I think about it more, it strikes me as so damn passive aggressive. Like my dad chose to text me AFTER her birthday just so he could lay on the guilt. 

Why not text me the day of her birthday and say ""Hey, it's grandma's birthday and I'm heading over there to visit, wanna join me?""

Isn't that the normal thing to do? Or am I just a rude, oblivious person overthinking things?"

I will always be thankful for the opportunities that got me away from her and enabled me to seek help. However, I will never forget the abuse, and how it affects me to this day. Yes maybe I wasn't the perfect child and had issues being withdrawn at school, but why did that mean it had to be beaten out of me EVERY SINGLE DAY? Why didn't she get proper help?

I am biracial myself (black and white). I got a 4D ultrasound done, and she says the baby looks like the first guy and has ""black features"". I can't help this. I told her that yes, the ultrasound is somewhat how the baby is going to look, but of course his nose looks alittle bigger, and his features are more prominent because he is squished up inside the womb. She texted my grandmother today saying ""there's no way"", and ""to check her calander and look at the dates"". I am extremely offended she continues to go behind my back and say my child's father isn't his father, and then pretends to my face she knows it is his. Then, she told my grandmother to delete the messages because ""sometimes I look in her phone"".

The father and I are getting a DNA test and are no longer together, and I can't wait to show her the results that it is his. Even the doctors have said right infront of her that the baby is right on track, and my report says ""size is consistent with dates"". There's no way I conceived in the beginning of January and got a menstrual cycle on the 23rd. And doctors ultrasounds are not going to be this far off. I am so fed up of my mother going behind my back, saying these things. It's offensive, and I am to the point now I just want to leave her out of the rest of this pregnancy. Am I wrong for not wanting her in the delivery room? At this point, I just want to be in there alone. I am tired of the stress and constant ""back stabbing"" from my own family

44,I wrote my College Essay a couple years ago about Growing up with a Ndad,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb42e8e80>,itsasher_notasscher,0,1,6,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536091557.0,9cz7e1,"Growing up in a household with my father was hard. Some nights would be calm and I’d fall asleep to the sound of him playing his keyboard, but most nights were full of screaming and crying. I grew up scared to sleep alone at night and used to locking myself in my parents bedroom while my mother cried and my father pounded on the door screaming. Eventually he would give up, go take a walk outside and the next morning he’d act like nothing had happened. I thought that every household was like mine and that every father would wake up their child in the middle of the night to settle a fight between him and his wife. I was used to the constant screaming. The only place I felt safe was when I was at school. I would walk into school and breathe a sigh of relief. I remember when it took a turn for the worst though. I don’t remember exactly what I had done that night specifically to make him mad, but I do remember having a water bottle being thrown at me and the top shattering across the floor. I truly think that was the turning point of his behavior. From that moment on he was out of control. 

Weeks after the water bottle incident, my mom took him to the doctor. I figured it was a routine check-up, maybe an x-ray for the brain tumour he had removed right before I was born. Little did I know, he was being admitted to the hospital, the psychiatric ward. One overnight stay at the doctors turned into days, then weeks. I was scared, I didn’t know where he was. I had to walk into school everyday smiling, pretending there was nothing wrong, when all I could think about was if my dad was okay. I wasn’t allowed to see him, and I remember being too upset to talk to him on the phone. I would give my mother gifts to give to him, little notes telling him to feel better. I didn’t know why he was gone, but I found myself feeling grateful that he was. I felt safe and got used to the calm of him being away. I later learned why he was gone, and what he was diagnosed with; Bipolar Disorder, ADHD, Narcissistic Personality Disorder and Depression. 

He goes in waves still with his illnesses. Sometimes his medicine stops working and he begins to spiral again, I still won’t sleep at his house. Growing up in a toxic house taught me a lot. Everyone sees me as this teenage white privileged girl, who lives in an expensive part of the city and buys starbucks every morning. What they don’t see is what goes on behind closed doors. They don’t see how I used to cry myself to sleep because I was too scared of what would happen to my mother while I was sleeping. Growing up with my dad having mental illnesses showed me how to grow up quickly, I often comforted my crying mother and had to put on a brave face to go to school. I became someone who felt like I was responsible for everyone's safety. I would make my mother sleep with me in my bed so she would be safe. I would usher her into the bedroom and lock the door when I felt him about to lose control. Although I was still just a child, I felt like I had the responsibility of an adult to keep my mother and myself safe from my father’s manic tendencies.

As a young adult, I now know that how I grew up was not a normal situation, that my father couldn’t fully control his actions and that my mother did her best to keep me as safe as she could. Looking back on my childhood, I can see a lot of things I couldn’t when I was living it. It shaped me into who I am today, someone strong and someone who cares tremendously about the people around me. I want to become someone who people feel safe around. As someone who only felt safe at school, I want to become a teacher. I want to be a safe space for children who feel unsafe at home, or feel like they need to pretend like everything's okay, even when it is not."
45,Anyone else fooled into thinking their Nparent was awesome?,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfacf0d198>,AnnieB8764,0,18,29,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536061672.0,9cuv9z,"At this point in my life, I have no doubt that my father is a manipulative and damaging narcissist (in addition to being an alcoholic and possibly a deeply closeted homosexual). And my mom is a complete enabler. My husband and I are in the process of going VLC with both of them. But until about 10 years ago (I'm 44 now), I would have told you they were two of my favorite people on earth.

Looking back, I see that many of the nice things my dad did were for the purpose of keeping up appearances (like making sure I went to a good college and a good graduate school in a field of study that were ultimately completely wrong for me but that he thought would impress people). But I also recall him teaching me solid ethics--which he himself has never adhered to--and being genuinely and appropriately affectionate.

It's hard to reconcile all that with the person I see now, who has gotten more overtly mean and self-centered with age. I also think I was the golden child--my scapegoat brother probably has a very different take on things. I know, looking back, that I toed the line really well for a very long time without realizing that that was what I was being raised to do.

I guess I feel like a complete idiot--I know many narcissists try to maintain an image of the perfect family to the outside world, which my dad completely did, but I fell for it, too. My husband has gradually been helping me see things as they really are--my dad, incidentally, is HORRIBLE to my husband and always has been, in addition to being alternately annoyed with/indifferent to our children, I think because their world does not revolve around him, and because my husband helped open my eyes. My dad only wants to deal with people who are broken or otherwise easily manipulated. 

Does anyone else have a similar experience? In one way, I am grateful for the relatively calm childhood I had, or thought I had--especially after hearing about others' heartbreakingly awful upbringings--but in another way I keep second-guessing myself."

Nmom told me yesterday that Ndad told her he knows he’s bipolar. My brother & I have no relationship with him, and it wasn’t easy for us as kids. Nmom says: “so hopefully this helps you understand why he says & does the stuff he does.” Well ok, but it doesn’t excuse it, and my bro and i bore the brunt of his cruel sarcastic remarks, backstabbing & total emotional unavailability all our lives. 

As usual, my mom said that she’s “stuck in the middle” of us 3 because bro & I keep VLC with Ndad, and that she’s affected the most by it cuz she’s his wife. She seriously expects us to *try harder* & have a relationship with him. We’ve tried. We get hurt every.single.time. I let go of him over a year ago & only call on bdays, etc. I am sorry for him that he suffers from this, but he chose not to get help, treat us like shit & then expects respect & connection. And my mom uses tears as usual. I told her I’d had enough of all the sarcasm & crap, and she’s like, “when did he make the sarcastic remarks? If I knew it happened, I would’ve stopped it.” And I told her about the times he said terrible things about me to Nmom and then she’d tell me what he said. Her response?? “I just can’t see why I’d tell you things like that.” Wow, how invalidating. 

I told Nmom I began working thru the pain of no relationship w Ndad 4 years ago, and feel little to no emotion about it now. She kept dropping in conversation that I’m “beginning healing”, like no, you have no idea where I’m at, and you can’t because you’re still making excuses for Ndad & can’t accept that I’m not a pliable teen/20-something anymore.

49,"Ndad's reaction to my illness and injury - seems to imitate, very weird.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb6e66198>,ichbindertod,0,2,5,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536097984.0,9d0465,"So I've been saying for over a month that I've done something to my knee. It really hurts and it keeps locking out randomly while I'm walking, at which moments it feels like it's about to bend the wrong way and snap. Today I wore brick red tights and due to the colour/denier you could really see the contours of my legs, and it turns out - eek - the kneecap that's been bothering me is significantly lower than the healthy one, and kind of twisted inwards. To use medical terminology, it looks fucked. 

Anyway, as soon as I noticed it I went and showed my eMum, who was shocked and agreed with me that it looks wrong. She called my nDad over and his response was:

a), 'what, do you have a bad knee do you?' (I have been mentioning this for **weeks**, and had specific conversations with him about it)

b) 'ha you're just like me then, my right calf is killing me today'

c) 'ah never mind' [end of conversation]

d) It is now 10ish hours later and he's LIMPING AROUND THE HOUSE and mentioning his alleged leg pain every five seconds. I was just showing mum a drawing and he came upstairs for no reason other than to clutch his leg, make some loud 'AH, OWWW' noises, and leave the room again. 

This is not a new pattern of behaviour. It doesn't matter what ailments we have in this house, if my dad hears about them he will instantly claim to be suffering from the same or similar symptoms, and he'll complain about them a lot louder than we do. Occasionally he will also blame us for them for good measure, usually picking whatever lifestyle choice of ours he doesn't like as the cause of the illness. This has actually caused me some issues I'm trying to work through where I blame myself for anything wrong with me and don't seek treatment. It's probably the underlying reason I didn't do anything about this knee for over a month. 

Anyone else's nparents react like this to illness or injury? Or if not, how do they act when you're ill?"

When I was a teenager I LOVED the emo/scene look and I wanted to dress that way desperately, (cringe I know) but if I wore anything black, anything at all really, my mother and her sister relentlessly made fun of me. Makeup? Passive aggressive comments about being a slut, no makeup? You look boring, ""normal clothes""? You look like you don't care, anything black? You look ridiculous what's wrong with you? The only time she ever said anything positive about my appearance was when I would wear anything similar to what she wore when she was a teenager. Now, I never got to dress as a cringey little scene kid, I never got to experience being part of a group because I was too afraid of ridicule, and even now as an adult I struggle with how I'm perceived when I dress. Regardless of what I wear I just hear her telling me I look stupid. Nothing looks right on my body because of her and I can't stand it.

I'm good now, but I feel I have to tell someone about this time.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb42f12e8>,Sanftmut,0,2,12,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536078632.0,9cx8x9,"So... the thing is, I never told people I had suicidal thoughts, because I felt it was unfair to do that. Probably because my father sometimes used it as a threat to us. And because I didn't want to be a burden to someone else, and thinking I could kill myself would be a burden for other people. Even if I was never close to do it. 

I remember that I didn't want those thoughts. They just came. I mean, it might be obvious that you don't want to be suicidal, but it frightened me how subtly they slid into my conciousness. Like a warmhearted, creepy whisper telling me the pain could be gone. And I remember some stupid thought like ""Oh, that's how you get those thoughts"", because before I wondered why people could ever see that as an option. And I felt like it's really wrong to think that and that telling someone would be emotional blackmailing to care for me. I guess I wanted that someone cared without that... 

&#x200B;

And even years later... when I tried to tell people I have depression and they were like ""No, you are fine. Look at how much you've accomplished"" I never used the argument of ""But I was suicidal, so I guess it really was bad."" I felt like I had to keep that fact to myself, because it's so severe it would force people to do something about it or at least to believe me... or maybe I was afraid it would just sound like that ""attention seeking"" thing and make everything worse. 

&#x200B;

I don't know. I never told someone. But often I wished someone knew. I wished someone cared about the fact that I was so miserable life felt unbearable. 

&#x200B;

I also had a very angry period. After I had tried to tell people about my depression and they didn't believe me, I had really angry thoughts of killing myself just to show them they were wrong. I wanted to write a farewell letter only saying ""You could have known"". In this period things were already getting better and my anger was probably a healthy sign of me feeling my needs. Though sometimes the anger got so massive I felt like going crazy and was really afraid I might act on that anger. Afraid of losing control over everything. I remember that I told myself in those moment ""It will be gone in ten minutes. You just have to deal with this for ten minutes. You can do that"", and I went outside my flat and just walked. Kept walking and telling myself that in ten minutes, I will regain the feeling that I want to live. I usually calmed down, went  home and cried about my life. 

&#x200B;

I guess these thoughts are part of my past, and I want them to be a part of my story. Maybe just because it's the truth. I don't want to exclude that part anymore, I don't want to live up to that image other people created for me. 

&#x200B;

I'm not good at trusting that people would help me. So maybe, keeping those thoughts for myself was also to protect myself from any reactions that would have made it worse. Currently, I'm trying to learn to let people see when I need them. Let them see when I need some care. Maybe that's why I want this off my chest now. I want to tell someone that I was at this dark place with little to no hope. I'm not that strong, happy person everyone else sees in me. (Please don't say: ""But you are strong for fighting depression"" or anything in that direction. Might be true, but my whole life that kind of argument was used to gaslight me into thinking I don't need or deserve help.)

Shows me the oil thing then tells me she'll go to a different Walmart so I don't have to be seen with her. That I insulted her. Asks what happened to me. Says, ""I'm done with you."" and storms off. 

I texted her an apology saying it wasn't personal I just wanted to be able to shop and look around because she doesn't like that. She responds by saying ""It is personal. You did want me going to the murder mystery with you. You did not want me going to see a movie with you. It is all well and good when you need for something, but heaven forbid I should simply want the pleasure of your company. Your actions speak volumes."" The murder mystery was an on campus event at college that when I told her I was going she asked to come and I said I didn't want that. I also spent $200 on going with her to a murder mystery party that wasn't on campus. The movies is I think in reference to going to see a movie for my birthday with David and Sarah. Keep in mind I have offered to go to the movies with her separately than that but she always declines. 

I'm 22 and just go my license. She's been driving me to and from work this summer and I always said thank you.

Update: She just called me crying about how I've broken her heart and insulted her. Because I don't text her to ask how she's doing or call her up. She wants to know if me planning this party will be an imposition on her, I said no. I tried to reassure her I still want a relationship. She says I have to ""figure this out"" for myself on having a ""close"" (read: codependent) relationship with her. She knows moving back home would be hell for me, it's hell for her being there.

-also, he’s 1 inch shorter than me. She told me that if a man isn’t at least 4 inches taller than me (I’m 5’10” so that narrows things down) I shouldn’t even speak to him because I look “like a mother talking to a baby” (??!!)

She has a 5yo daughter (E) who is a sweet, spunky, caring, sensitive little girl. Father is not in the picture after some custody issues (seriously a good thing, even with an nMom). My future MIL enables watches E a few days each week but largely doesn’t do much to curb nSIL’s behavior. 

My fiancé and I want to do what we can to help E have a good childhood despite the circumstances and try our best to confront nSIL when we can about N behaviors. But we also don’t want to push it too far and have her pull a NC (unlikely but still want to be safe). 

Any tips for how to help E deal with it all as she grows up? Things we can do to support her and show her that nSIL behavior isn’t normal? We’ve always reminded E that she can talk to us about anything and we are a safe place and we love her. 

Thanks for the help in advance "

* nMom regularly pees on the bed, and eDad refuses to give her diapers as they are not comfortable. So if she says she needs to go to the toilet, we jump. Twice in the last week she asked me to the toilet within minutes of going the last time. Then nothing happens. She keeps trying for 30 minutes, I ask every 5 if she is done. As we walk back she says: ""I did not need the toilet, but I like that you kept giving me attention. 
* nMom - unable to walk by herself is in constant pain. She permanently sings in a whimpering voice. I ask if she wants pain killers. ""No"". I ask her if she notices that she makes those sounds. ""No pain killers"". I ask her if she can try not to make the noise ""You don't give me any attention if I'm quiet. 
* nMom - is hungry and wants to eat. She is struggling with a spoon but insists my dad gives her all the fruit she has for breakfast cut into tiny pieces. I decide to cut it into larger pieces she can eat by herself and won't need a spoon for. She complains. When I ask why it's not easier like this her reply is: ""I want you to help me with the spoon, I don't want to eat by myself"". We still set there, next to her but we can feed ourselves.

65,Should I tell my brother about my Ndad’s love child?,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfae6cc3c8>,happynattyy,0,5,5,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536085428.0,9cybhl,"*UPDATE my dad just sent this text to me & Patrick*:
I had a dream a month ago that your mother killed herself I never told her the dream but I can see that’s what you guys are pushing her to do. It’s fine though. No matter what you guys think of me it’s heartless to have people on her job looking at her in a messed up state because of what you say to her. 
All this because you guys are too proud for us to say anything to? Smh. Please leave her out of this you guys are killing her and I won’t allow it.”

My Ndad verbally, emotionally and mentally tortured my brother (we’ll call him Patrick) and I growing up. A few years ago, while away at college, I found out Ndad had a child with the same woman he was cheating on my Emom with for years. Once I found out, Ndad pulled out all of the stops to get me to forgive him and not tell my brother. Unfortunately, I was stupid enough to believe he changed and kept quiet about it.
However, Patrick is now living with my insane parents again while looking for a stable post undergraduate job, and my Ndad wasted no time getting back to verbally abusing Patrick. I have gone NC with both parents as a result of this (as of 2 weeks ago). 
But the problem is that Patrick is extremely depressed and sees no way out of the abusive cycle, even though I keep telling him that it is imperative for him to get out. I even told him he could move in with me immediately. I think that being honest with Patrick about the secret child, will help to finally push him out of that shithole by illustrating the depths of my parents’ manipulation. But I’m scared of causing him to spiral into an even darker place. 

What should I do? Thank you for your time.

That I really am a bad person as I've been made to believe and that I've fabricated this whole thing in my head that my parents are narcissistic or at least possess some of the traits.

And yet I can't ignore certain things anymore. I can't ignore how their behaviour matches the traits. How I identify and feel the pain of people in similar situations. I keep rationalising what's happened because it seems too awful, too sick to believe this happened and is still happening. Its like I've found out a dirty little secret. That the people that are meant to love me want to hurt me. That they would take advantage of my nature. 

For years my friends have hated my parents from what I tell them, but I just brushed it off and in my head thought no I deserve this, my friends are just too soft, parents should be hard on their kids and I obviously thought ""of course my friends are going to side with me my version of events could be bias and also they want to make me feel validated"". I was told by my parents that ""Mary's parents think the sun shines out her ass"" whenever they just loved their kid normally. My version of what is normal is skewed. I believed my parents telling me I was all these negative words. If it weren't for my best friend I doubt I'd have realised. She is so bitter towards them for how I've been treated. Whenever she comes to my house my dad acts so fake and weird and she feels uncomfortable because she knows what he's really like. Like I deserve to be slapped, hit, emotionally abused, called stupid most days despite excelling academically, ganged up on, called fat since age 10 when I was not, being chased up the stairs running from someone who's supposedly my dad who's screaming at me ,""IM GOING TO KILL YOU""., told my nose is warped, that I'm socially awkward, will never find a husband, compared to my prettier and more socially conforming friends. grounded for eating a chocolate bar, talked about critically as if I'm not in the room, humiliated in front of my friends/boyfriend, shouted at for other siblings behaviour, my dad walking into my room despite me saying ""I'm getting changed"", being banned from using the computer when I need to do schoolwork, told that I'm such an expense as a child and made to feel guilty. 

I can't stop crying realising the reality of it all. I always wondered what was so wrong with me, what I did to anger and upset them so much. A lifetime of indignant injustice is threatening to overwhelm me. Any advice on where to go from here would be appreciated. One reason I feel like this has happened as the youngest of 4 children is my relaxed nature allows people to walk all over me. I never respond to insults because it seems useless to but I'm now wondering if this has enabled the abusers behaviour. I don't want to turn into them by acting like them."

I must have been no older than 10 at the time, our family were staying at a hotel and one day we went to the breakfast buffet. I looked at the cereal and I was intrigued by this bowl of brown things that looked kind of like cornflakes, they looked appetising and I wanted to see what they tasted like (I was a weird kid OK). 

My dad said to me: ""you don't like bran flakes, they taste of cardboard""

I don't remember anything else about that day. Just the disappointment I felt at being told I wasn't allowed to even taste something right in front of me, for no good reason, when I was really curious about it. 

I didn't know what a narcissist parent was until this year. And now that I know, something really struck me about what my dad said.

He didn't say ""you wouldn't like those"". He said ""you don't like those"". It makes so much sense to me now. There's huge meaning in that subtle change of words. I'd never tried bran flakes before in my life, but he wasn't speculating on whether I'd actually like them or not. He wasn't warning me that I should try something else because I probably wouldn't like them. No, what he was saying, subconsciously, was:

""In my mind, you are not a separate person with their own set of likes and dislikes, and their own sense of curiosity. You are an extension of me and my ego. I don't like bran flakes, therefore, you don't like bran flakes"".

My cousin (pseudonym for story purposes is Alice) is 16 years old and has recently disclosed that she has been physically and emotionally abused by her mother since she was 5. She is an only child. 

Recently, Alice has been in trouble with the law. The first time, she allegedly chased her mother with a kitchen knife, the second time, she physically hit a neighbor. Alice insists that she did not chase her mother with the knife and she says that she did hit the neighbor but that the neighbor was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. (She said that her mother had started a physical altercation with her that was brought to the neighbor’s home, during which Alice lashed out at the neighbor.) Alice was placed in the custody of my mother (her aunt) and has been for about two weeks.

For background, Alice says that her mother will physically attack her (holding her by the face, pulling her hair, slamming her onto the ground, punching her, etc.), then when Alice tries to defend herself, her mother calls the police and reports that her daughter is abusing her. The attacks are unprovoked and seem to be sparked by a 16 year old acting like a 16 year old - slightly bratty, a little sarcastic, but nothing major.

Alice says that if she is upset, her mother immediately becomes angry and tells her how much harder her own life is than Alice’s. Alice is unable to talk to her mother or receive advice from her because she is so aggressive. Her mother will call her horrible names (ex. Slut) or say terrible things (ex. I wish I never had you.) Since Alice has been with my mother, her mother keeps saying that Alice is hurting her by not answering her calls or texts. She says that Alice is rude for not doing so. It seems like everything is about Alice’s mother.

Alice herself is a very small, timid girl who was spoiled by her mother. She is a little bratty but all teenagers are. I’ve never seen her be aggressive or violent with anyone but her mother. She went to court over the neighbor battery charge and the judge is determined to send Alice back to her mother after two individual counseling sessions each and two group counseling sessions together.

Alice’s mother has never been diagnosed but I’m pretty sure she’s a narcissist. I know that people with personality disorders rarely get better and I am nervous about the fact that Alice may have to go live there again. Alice didn’t speak up during the court hearing about her physical fights with her mother as being self-defense because her mother was present.

I’m worried about her. What can I do to keep her with my mother and, therefore, safe? If Alice has the police called on her again, she will go to juvenile detention. She’s not that kind of kid but everyone believes her mother over her.

But deity-of-your-choice forbids it's someone I care about that's being loud. My person is naturally loud and rambunctious, he gets loud - as one does - when enjoying himself, chatting to friends or watching a game. 


And me? Whenever he gets loud I'm terrified or I snap and yell too. Loud voices, raised inflections from someone I love, terrify me to the core. Because when I was growing up, someone getting loud means BAD. Bad things will happen and usually they downpour on me, the scapegoat of the year. Someone getting loud means my good day is about to turn sour, means I need to run interference and I need to do it fast, or... Or else. I don't think I'm so much afraid of the loudness as I am of its implications, because it's been programmed into me to fear the ""or else"".


And loud voices are my air raid sirens for those ""or else"". I'm not dumb by any means, but I can't seem to reprogram myself that loud sometimes just means someone's totally immersed in enjoying what they're doing.

Context:

I'm in my late twenties and I cut off nmom entirely when I was in my early twenties. If you check my post history, you can see a little more of what our dynamic was. Like all nmoms, however, she was terrible.

That is to say, she still is terrible, just very very very far away from me. I haven't spoken to her in years, but occasionally she does little things to try to trick me. Recently, she sent me a YouTube link from a profile that pretended to be someone else. When I opened the video, it was me! A childhood video of myself as a toddler with my sister painting Easter eggs.

I started crying-- being unexpectedly confronted with things like this will do that. I thought, *what a jerk! What a terrible lady. She made a whole fake profile just to make me click this video. For what, emotional blackmail? She's the worst.*

I blocked the profile and I ***am not going to actually say anything to her***, but for the purposes of venting, I've composed a letter which I hope you all don't mind me sharing.

>I see what this is; I see the strategy here. You show me some fond memory we both have of before any of this happened, and I come around to see that I've been unreasonable. It's very transparent, and you've tried it before.

>First of all, I think it’s pretty telling that your video of choice is so old. I'm barely verbal at this point, and I probably hadn't yet developed the ability to remember events, because let me tell you, ***I do not remember it.*** It’s great that **you** miss the egg decorating, but for all intents and purposes, I may has well have not even been there.  
>  
>The interesting thing about deciding to have children is that you have to go into it knowing that your kids will grow up. That little girl you're reminiscing about was just as real as the grown woman you're harassing, and she spent a lot more time out of that phase than she spent in it.  
>  
>Your memories of raising me are good for you because they all occurred before I developed this “mean streak,” aka **started calling you out on your bulls\*\*\*.** You get to cherry pick the individual 6-minutes of footage from any holiday event where I knew I had to be cheery for the camera and go, ""Ohhhh, WittyRutabaga was so sweet back then! What happened?""

>OH **MAN**, I wish you had a camera going when I was working a part time job and in community college at the same time, trying to save up for a big move, and you busted into my room screaming at the top of your lungs at 3 o’clock in the morning. I didn't know it at the time, but you were having a psychotic episode, and despite my urging, you never sought therapy because, ""I'm fine, I was just drunk.""  
>  
>I wish you had the camera on when you screamed at me in front of 5 of my friends in high school because a sixth friend had just left without saying, ""Thank you,"" to you. Those five kids said, ""Thank you"" on their way out and *never* came to our house again.

Dad refused to follow you, so \[sister\] took the other car, and I, a 13-year-old, rode alongside her. When \[sister\] and I caught up to you, you started running and tried to hitchhike with two college kids who were terrified of you because you were sobbing and yelling. \[Sister\] and I had to pull you off their car and out of the road so they could drive away.

It was mostly autoimmune and IBS-type things. I learned to hide my suffering (we all know what it’s like to be sick around N’s) so I wouldn’t be tormented anymore. For the most part, it worked. They had no clue when things were going on.

Things got REALLY bad in college as I was bedridden with full body pain, autoimmune symptoms, and unable to keep water down. Essentially, dying slowly. Hid that too.

I was finally diagnosed and treated for Endometriosis which was really severe and destroying my daily life since middle school. My period was always hell and suspected it, but I get confused when I read others’ experiences like “I couldn’t get out of bed,” “couldn’t go to school,” “debilitating,” etc. I’m like “What are you talking about?” 

Every time since starting, I was violently sick from both ends, screaming in pain, tunnel vision-ing, shaking, but could walk out of the bathroom as if I was absolutely fine. The pain was more manageable at school because I knew that I had to push through and learned how to stop myself from passing out. Maybe it’s because I had a distraction?

QUESTION: It was as if I could turn the pain “on and off.”  That I could be in as much pain as I “allowed” my body to be in. Now that I’ve had my Endo surgery and am not in as much pain, I am realizing just how bad it was and am horrified how ANYONE could hide THAT much unimaginable, incomprehensible pain as if nothing is happening. I can’t even wrap my brain around how much pain I was in. Now that I ""allow"" myself to feel it, I'm feeling it.

Literally what even?! Is this even a thing? Don’t know if it’s a trauma skill of dissociating (a useful one) or some amazing willpower. I had been practicing it since I was a child and still continue today. Obviously the need to be fine for the N’s would play a large part in this. But I think you can push yourself and dissociate through any pain if needed.

I could probably write a book about the crap I had to deal with growing up. I think it's important to share stories, and see commonalities, so here's mine. 

&#x200B;

My Mother is a narcissist. As a little girl, I was her baby doll, being dressed up in the cutest dresses and being constantly doted on. Once I started talking, that's when everything went down hill. I would be yelled at, hit, called every name in the book, and was basically her slave. If she wasn't giving me a verbal beatdown, she was ordering me around, ""take out the trash"", ""make me food"", & and so many others. She went so far as to encourage me to commit suicide, and had I actually been suicidal at the time, I can't say that I wouldn't have followed through with it. There were a few times in high school when she didn't allow me to shower because it would, ""raise the light bill"".  My aunts and uncle, were always her sisters and brother, she never spoke of them in relation to me. No matter what happened, it was never her fault. She got arrested once, and it was the cop's fault. My dad was a bastard, in her mind, when he gave me stuff and not her. 

&#x200B;

When I was 14, I was hit by a car and taken to the hospital with a dislocated knee. Rather than ask me if I was alright, she got into the room, waited until the doctors and nurses were gone, and told me I was going to get so much money from this. Yep, you read that right. I was just hit by a car, and she was looking forward to the settlement money that I would eventually get. I did get a pretty decent settlement from the accident though, about $9500. Thankfully, my dad was smart and got me a lawyer, and I set up a meeting with her to ask her to hold on to the check until I turned 18. I picked up the check shortly after my 18th birthday, and opened a savings account in my name. Boy was she pissed that she wasn't on the account, she needed the money ""to raise me"". She conned me out of $4000 dollars, which she used to pay off her credit cards, and told me she would pay back... that was over five years ago and I still haven't seen a penny. 

&#x200B;

Sometimes, I'd lose things, like any normal person would. When I'd ask her if she'd seen it, she would say that I was accusing her of stealing it. One time, she swiped a five dollar bill out of my pants and I asked her if she had seen it, as I thought I may have left it on a counter or something, again, I was the bitch for accusing her of stealing. Yet, after I took the dog out to cool off, she called me into my room, lifted a pillow, and lo and behold, there was my money. All nice and flat underneath the pillow. It's kind of hard to believe that she didn't put it there, considering it was crumpled up in my pocket the day before. 

&#x200B;

About a month before I graduated high school, she kicked me out for going to the bathroom before getting ready for school, because it ""went against routine"". I was a ""backwards ass"", which angered me and things escalated to the point where she said, ""your 18, you're on your own, get the fuck out of my house"". I was so upset that when my dad picked me up, I was sitting on the front porch crying. I called off from school that day, I was 18, so I could excuse myself. She got a call saying that I wasn't in class, and reported me skipping. This would have barred me from walking at graduation, and I told her as much. So she got to call the attendance office and excuse the absence so I could walk. Thankfully, she was willing to let me spend the weekend at my father's house, like she did unless she was pissed at him for some stupid reason, and I stuffed my duffel bag as full as I could get it and didn't come home after the weekend. The following Monday, I went to the school counselor and changed my address to my dad's and explained what happened. She was beyond kind and understanding and told me exactly what I had to do. 

&#x200B;

Of course, there were complications, she wouldn't let me have my things or my dog. For about two years, I had to steal from myself just so I could have clothes. She let her crackhead friends sleep in my room, do drugs in there (I once found a makeshift pipe) and take whatever clothes and jewelry they wanted. I was furious when I found my class ring missing, and she got pissed when I confronted her and told her I had reported it stolen, and given the police her friend's names and contact info. 

&#x200B;

It took nearly two years for me to get my dog back, and when I did he was skin and bones, with wounds from a fight with another dog. It took me three days to get him to eat, and he was just barely beginning to gain weight when my mother brought the cops to my house after I refused to give him back to her. She wanted to take him back to the same house, where the dog that attacked him lived, and out of concern for his safety, I said no. Unfortunately, because everything pertaining to him was in her name, I was forced to give him back to her. I told her to never speak to me again. She called me the same damn day and told me to come get him because he'd been hurt again. I was livid. My dad and I were sharing a car at the time, so I didn't have the car until the following monday, and when I went to get him, I was infuriated. She had left him in his kennel the entire weekend, not even letting him out to go to the bathroom. His kennel was soaked in urine, and he was bonier than before, as if he hadn't eaten. I took him home, gave him a bath, fed him, washed out his kennel, set up an appointment with a vet I knew, and got him registered in our county. My baby ate like he was starved. He cleaned the bowl in less than 10 minutes. I would be damned if she took him from me again, as she clearly demonstrated that she wasn't capable of taking care of him. She tried again about six months later, and failed. My Moose has been living with me for about three years now, although he's still got some trust issues surrounding women, he knows that I'll do anything to make sure he has what he needs. He doesn't get hit, he doesn't get yelled at (unless he's doing the yelling), and he doesn't get locked in the kennel unless we have to leave for more than a couple hours (he gets bored and destroys the apartment).

&#x200B;

My mother has more recently convinced my family that I'm nothing but a liar and a thief. None of my maternal family members speak to me, especially after I cut my mother out of my life a couple years ago. I only have one cousin who talks to me because he's lived with her. He knows what she's like, and he saw the way she treated me. He's the only one who believed me. 

&#x200B;

One of her favorite abuse techniques is telephone harassment. She used to call me upwards of 40 times a day, calling me every name in the book, detailing how she was going to get me fired, making threats on my life, things like that. Eventually, she got my work phone number, and started harassing me at work. So, my boss got involved, and called a couple friends of his at the local police department (he had retired from there several years earlier). I spoke to an officer, and explained what was happening, let her listen to the voicemails that she left. And she said that she would tell her to cut it out, but, if she did that, I couldn't reach out to her. This was because, if I wanted to press telephone harassment charges, the DA wouldn't take the case if I'd reached out and contacted her. I agreed not to contact her. Little did I know, I had just made the best decision of my life. 

&#x200B;

About a year after she threw me out, I was diagnosed with anxiety, likely caused by the abuse from my mother. It took over a year of therapy, and daily SSRI's, but I'm doing really well. Cutting her out of my life was one of the best things I ever did, and I don't regret it in the slightest. I have a wonderful Fiance, a nice apartment, Moose is spoiled rotten, and things are looking great for me. It's possible to overcome the lifetimes of abuse we all suffer. It's not easy, but it's doable. No contact has been a great thing for me, and I have no reason or desire to make contact with her. And I'm determined to not raise my children the way she raised me. I refuse to be that kind of mother. Our family's cycle of abuse stops with me. "

I’ve been NC (100%, no exceptions) for 3 years now. We all live in the same neighborhood and my narc goes to the large grocery store nearby. I never ever step foot in there because I know she shops there. 

My brother in law does go there and he struggles with English. He’s run into her a few times there and she always takes that as her opportunity to get info about us. 

Of course, she tracked him down today. He wants to be polite and has a hard time coming up with what to say (such as “I really need to get going, have a great day” which is what I would prefer he do...) so he gave her info about us. I’m not sure what info she got but I am just so angry. I will find out later what she asked. 

She always targets the weak link. Back when I was in contact, she didn’t even have enough respect for him to remember his name, in fact she would just call him some random stereotypical Latino name and always chose one that was not his name. 

Any ideas what I could say to him to get the point across to not give out any info? She’s gotten people fired from their jobs in the past and that’s not something I would put past her. And you know it drives her crazy how absolutely NC I’ve stayed. Luckily we have a camera on our house so I can make sure she’s not stalking. "

77,How do you deal with narc enablers?,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb58974e0>,cosmo_kitten906,0,10,26,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536050857.0,9ctu7d,"My dad is ex military, meaning that he missed a lot of my narc mums behaviour as he was often away. He’s left the military for quite a few years now so he’s experienced some of the stuff she’d been doing to my brother and I for years, and I’ve had many breakdowns where I’ve explained what she’s done, but it’s like he refuses to acknowledge it?

Well, that’s not strictly true. My Nmum is also extremely emotionally abusive to my dad, she treats him terribly, they will typically end up in an argument or he just takes the abuse and rants to me about it afterwards. When he does rant to me about it, it’s as if it’s the first time he’s seen her treat someone like that despite the fact he watches her do it to my brother and I all the time. I try to explain to him that the way she is treating him isn’t new and that she’s been like this for years. The thing is that when she does do it to us, he refuses to back us up. He chooses to pick her side, even when it makes absolute no sense.

He’ll tell us that she’s the parent and we must respect that and do what she says. She’s extremely anal about how things get done (they must be done exactly the way she wants it otherwise she has a meltdown and starts a huge  fight) but instead of realising that this behaviour of her is uncalled her, he tells us that we should walk on eggshells, always accommodate to her, basically that we should know better. 

It’s kinda hard to explain it all in a way that makes sense? Here’s an example of what I’m talking about:

My mother frequently accuses me of doing drugs (I don’t drink, I don’t do drugs, I don’t go out late, I have wholesome friends, I’m literally the last person to do drugs) but for some reason I could just be sitting at the table and she’d accuse me of doing drugs. 

One day she showed me a photo of a new sofa she bought and I said it was nice but my response wasn’t good enough so she accused me of not even looking at the picture and made me describe it, obviously since i did in fact look at the picture I was able to describe it and prove her wrong. So she accused me of doing drugs. I was clearly bothered by it and kinda just avoided her and because I was being ‘huffy’ she screamed my dads name to get him to rip into me for her because I was being ‘disrespectful’.

We had a huge family argument over it, i kept explaining that I found it offensive to be accused of taking drugs for no reason, that I had my phone taken off me, been sat down and shouted at, because I was offended of being accused of something. After lots of screaming and shouting my mum decides to come up with the excuse ‘I was only joking’

Now we ALL know she wasn’t joking but my dad decides to jump on the excuse with her, backing her up and telling me repeatedly that it was just a joke, all fun and bants. I fully broke at that point and told him that I was oh so glad that we was able to knowingly lie to me to avoid going against my mum. He didn’t say anything. 

I’m so sorry for ranting about it, I can’t seem to come up with a simplified version of what I’m trying to explain? 

So how do you deal with parents that just enable and encourage narc behaviour, forcing you to deal with it the same way they’ve chosen to deal with it, instead of actually addressing it and realising that the narc is wrong."

I was kinda shocked, I'm in a relationship with my girlfriend since 2 years, and she often told me about her mother being an alcoholic, and also abusive, but I would have never thought that she would behave like that.

The worst thing is tho, that I can't have my girlfriend come over at the moment. I have really important stuff to do for work, and I just can't have her over. I told her that she can come over for 2 weeks but only next week, until then I just can't because I would get in trouble.

Then she said that she felt like she was losing me and was feeling all emotional and nostalgic. It's probably because I recently started standing up for myself (I've been hanging out with my dad a lot more so she would often try to guilt trip me or rant about how he is demonic and left her in debt blablabla and then goes on to say that she holds no grudges and she's fine)

Most of the stories on here are really horrible and full on abusive, but my nMum is on a lower level of narcissism and I feel really bad that I am incapable of feeling normal around her. I get irritable and defensive around her. I just don't know what to do.

 I just needed to vent a bit and was also wondering if there is anyone else here with a lower level Nparent who can relate?

85,[TW:All of the Above] Building a support system from nothing and Only people who experience this will understand why this is terrifying,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb7322e80>,TesseractToo,0,1,6,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536082065.0,9cxt1n," Hi, nice to meet you all I come from a small and insular (if you can call it that, I am the excluded black sheep that everyone else has permission to abuse) family. We were immigrants so there were no cousins, aunts/uncles, no grandparents, nothing like that.   


I just learned about Narcissism about a year ago when I was seeing a psychologist following losing everything when I moved halfway around the world to get married with my partner of 6 years cohabiting for 2 years. Due to various reasons, some I know and some I never will, he turned his back on me and iced me out as he was having an online affair and became cruel and violent and since I'd sold my home and sold or donated to charity everything that wasn't shipped (so pretty much everything) and re-homed my pets- I had nothing to go back to.   


I'd put everything into this promise that even if things didn't work out that he would always be there (which of course was said to me enough times over the years that I believed him and also of course was not true).   


I was really trying to go no contact with my NMom, who is extremely cruel in such a flippant dismissive way you can get whiplash trying to follow her cognitive dissonance. My stepdad is extremely codependent on her, but even he gets exhausted at her emotional gluttony and managing her outbursts and how she likes to abuse anyone she can get away with abusing (pretty much that means me and whatever poor person she has targeted at a customer service counter or hotel management. She can shout the paint off a wall I'm sure. She enjoys abusing these poor people too, it's like she enjoys finding some small flaw in something so that she can bring some front desk clerk to tears over some menial thing just so she can get a tiny discount - it's embarrassing and I of course empathise deeply with whomever she has targeted in her sights, but at least they get to never see her again and hopefully go home to a loving family and she will be a story and a bad memory.   


When my partner started to turn on me, my world flipped upside down and inside out. The trauma of the abuse put me into a deep depression where I was unable to cope and I ended up attempting sui in a manner that no one (including myself) believes I should have survived. I'm still furious that I did. My mom didn't attempt to contact me while I was in the hospital and claims I was refusing her calls (no I gave them her contact info- how would they have even known how to contact her if I hadn't given them her contact?) When I called my parents for help, my mom laughed at me as though losing my partner in a strange continent was a hilarious joke.   


I'd moved here for safety and belonging especially into a family- belonging and community something that was taken away from me in stages in Canada as I met with trauma after trauma and became disabled due to pain and was having trouble coping with the pain (thus becoming ""less fun"") and my friends abandoning me one by one. It was uncanny the way it seemed to happen in patterns and it always eluded me what the common denominator was.   A couple days ago I reconnected with my ex and we have cautiously been seeing if we can talk and I was told ""as soon as you were in the hospital, your mom wasted no time telling me your mom was saying your traumas were made up lies and she was happy to completely throw you under the bus"". Holy. Effing.   


  
Now it makes sense how any therapist or help where my mom got in the middle went so completely FUBAR. Now it makes sense how so much of my life went so completely FUBAR. Normally my PTSD and cPTSD and being punished for having normal emotions has caused me to have what they call ""a flattened affect"" (I don't emotions well especially in relation to the amount of trauma I've endured) but once that had some time to soak in I became so enraged and so furious I broke my personal no contact and had to find out. Of course she denied all of it and demanded to know who had told me this. As if it would have been hard for her to figure out, it's not like she knows any of my contacts except one or two.   


  
So following that major nervous breakdown from losing everything (and a major move while disabled), followed by trying to counterbalance a crumbling relationship that went from awesome to nightmare, the attempt, 18 months of homelessness n a strange place (where I was psychically and sexually assaulted during this time), being taken advantage of by many unscrupulous people who I thought I was making a proper deal with and they were being dishonest, reaching out to see if anyone would help, having many smaller nervous breakdowns like aftershocks following a major earthquake, not knowing what is real anymore, acquiring major anxiety disorders like social phobia and agoraphobia, I don't know what to do. I went to a trauma specialist and she taught me about the Nmother - golden child - scapegoat child dynamic - it was a revelation.   


I need to be around kindness and support, that is why I came here and I need it so much more now that I'm alone and afraid. I've never not kept pets before and I'm surprised how much even fish kept me grounded and on a schedule. I don't have any motivation for self care and it feels in a way like a form of self harm, just denying myself anything as if I need punishment for all of this.   


And now I find out my mom is much more sociopathic than I ever imagined... which is like trying to imagine infinity. She of course doesn't do boundaries. She behaves like a spoiled six year old. A couple of examples to set the scene, once when I was staying over at her house she was freaking out that I had the audacity to sleep in till 10:30 am and she barged in and started beating me with both arms while I was in bed. I asked her why she was hitting me, and she said ""I didn't"" and then ""it's in the past no use in mulling over it"" - that was less than two minutes ago! Suddenly it had never happened. And she would ""just drop by"" to my house and pick fights with me regarding my brother (I had to go no contact with him, he is the golden child (not in talent or success but in the way he is treated but he is extremely dangerous and killed two of my tame talking birds just to drill in the point he enjoys harming me)- I told her no abuse and no picking fights in my house, this won't happen under my roof so she went just outside the back door and stared shouting insults in so the whole neighbourhood could hear her. I mean she literally behaves like a bratty six year old. Why is this so hard.     


Where are good people. I'm quite housebound due to being lied to by the renters who know I have to use mobility assist but when I arrived with boxes I was on the 4th floor of a walkup not the first as they had told me. What a nightmare. I'm so afraid my legs will buckle on me from the nerve damage in my legs when I go down the stairs.  


So thanks for listening to me rant and I don't know how to build a support from scratch after being this badly shaken and am now dealing with the experience of running into extreme psychos over and over... I don't feel safe. Oh and this is the thing that is terrifying. One of the times she was talking to my ex, she offered to buy us a house if we moved to her city in the US. At first I was surprised, she doesn't gift me with anything unless someone who she really wants to gift would benefit and she can use it to corral me somehow. That house wouldn't have been a home, it would have been her Trojan effing horse to have licence to barge in at any time ""it's my house and I can do what I want"" and completely disrupt our lives. And my ex's sudden personality change? Turns out it was a brain tumour :( And I miss him like crazy- the kind loving version, not the paranoid critical cruel fighting version- and if I knew it had some physicality I would have been able to endure the 9+months crammed in a studio apartment with him going through his perceptions of my character with a lice comb (thank mom for feeding him those paranoid thoughts), but he got married to the person he was having an online affair with and doesn't even live here anymore and I'm stranded and terrified and my pain is out of control. And I feel like I'm being played by an insane puppet master and her flying monkeys.  


I don't know what to do. I'm sorry if this is confusing, I'm very confused. Thanks for reading all of this.

it’s been almost 2 months since I got the courage to go completely NC. obviously there’s a bunch of backstory with my tipping point happening in February. i shortly went NC for about a month in march because we got in a fight about him ignoring my calls and texts to see him. he claims they don’t happen or that he’s just “so so busy that i couldn’t understand.” i’m a 5 minute drive off a highway on his way too and from work. so then he took a week vacation from work to fly across country to see his gf’s son. I was a “bitch” because i’m never happy for him and it’s selfish i’m mad that he was doing something nice for himself. you know, the usual. 

So july rolls around and he’s threatening to take me (21F)  to court for multiple reasons and saying my degree is worthless and i’m just a freeloader ( i’m in nursing school.) He texted me while I was working the night shift at the hospital, so I immediately know it was going to get ugly. I can attach screenshots of the conversation if you guys want, it’s pretty lengthy. but what he said that night will forever be engrained in my memory, almost like the night he pulled a shot gun on me. i told him i was done with him he told me “well goodbye don’t be mad when I die. i’m going to my attorney tomorrow and leaving everything to your brother. your mouth is overriding your ass.”  so I stopped responding because it’s useless. he then texts me like nothing is wrong and acts sad that i’m not in Arizona with him visiting his gf’s son. 

Honestly I could go on and on about the toxic shit he’s put me through. I had to take the ACEs test (for childhood trauma) in a class last week and my score really put it in perspective on how fucked it all really was. I am 100% confident that this is the best thing i’ve ever done for myself but I still have so much guilt. guilt that there’s more I can do or he just needs another chance. 

I am so happy that i’ve found this sub. I finally feel normal and validated, which is a new feeling for me. Cheers to daddy issues! "

90,nMom trying to get Medical Guardianship - Help (tw: entrapment),<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb185c358>,svensk100,0,1,1,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536108031.0,9d1e36,"Hi RBN, 

I've posted here a few times about my nMom trying to get medical guardianship over me. I am extremely concerned with the direction the case has taken and am looking for advice.

Here is why I am concerned:

1. My attorney is saying my options are basically go to an eating disorder inpatient program or let nMom be my medical guardian (and she would force this too). 
2. nMom and I do not reside in the state where the guardianship case is filed.
3. I have made it clear to my court-appointed attorney that nMom is abusive through evidence such as emails she has sent and that she should not be a guardian of anyone.
4. I went to an assessment for an eating disorder in a state I have never resided in (or even visited before) with a doctor and psychiatrist nMom chose. It doesn't seem like my lawyer fought that. He admitted that nMom probably got to talk to the assessors prior to my assessments.The doctor was very manipulative and disrespectful (and tried to sell me her book - seems like she was trying to gain a new patient (and $$ for her) for her program). I questioned some of her assessments in the appointment and now she's written an assessment of me saying nMom should be allowed to give me psychiatric drugs. The report also tries to make me look bad for being late, even though the court gave me to incorrect address on its order. 
5. Assessment with psychiatrist included her wanting me to comment on my body with pictures taken by a FM relative within my private residence without my knowledge or consent. 
6. Court-appointed attorney told me this had no connection to the court forcing me to attend this assessment: A few weeks before the court ruled that I should go to these assessments, GC brother held me hostage in a canoe for 30+ minutes and would not take me back to shore (despite me screaming for help and pleading out loud to God for help) unless I agreed to go to the doctor who was later appointed by the court (I ""agreed"" but didn't go with him). This was also him holding me hostage with the intent to take me across state lines.

There are more details, this is where I am starting and trying to piece things together. Can anyone help?"
91,Just a little vent piece on a NDad,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb7322a20>,throwaway351651,0,1,1,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536107704.0,9d1cnp,"I never know how to preface these posts, so I'm just gonna jump in.



My childhood was just a series of ""you're going to grow up homeless,"" ""you'll be just like your mother,"" ""where you're heading you'll be a prostitute on the streets by 18."" Most of this was a result of him being unhappy with my average (C's) grades. Math was one of my worst subjects growing up, no matter what grade I was in, I couldn't understand it.

I was eligable for special classes (there's a possibility I'm Autistic. Most of the family seems to think so) but Dad completely shot them down. According to him, the problem wasn't that I was ""stupid,"" it was that I was lazy and just never applied myself. He'd turn me down when I asked if I could get tutoring, completely refused to help me with homework, and even instructed whoever his girlfriends were at the time to not help me. It's like he just expected me to be a straight A student, but was appalled by the very notion that I couldn't just achieve that naturally.

I was always being put down or compared to. When I was 13 (14?), my dad once told his girlfriend, right in front of me, that his oldest son was the only one of his kids he's ever been proud of. Albeit, he was blackout drunk at the time (he's an alcoholic.) Not sure if that makes it better or worse. I distinctly remember him telling me once that he would hate me if I weren't his daughter. Many times he's told me he wasn't surprised that I didn't have friends. I've been called stupid more times than I could count, been told to fuck myself once, was accused of having a creepy father-complex a few times (this one completely floored me, since it was in response to me saying I didn't want to have to hear him having loud, screaming sex everynight at 14 years old. His room was just a very thin wall away from mine).

One time, when I was 15, I told him I wanted to kill myself. He completely blew a fuse, told me every woman whose ever told him that was just looking for attention. I was sent to my room and grounded for a week. Even to this day, despite being hospitalized when I was 17 due to chronic suicidal tendencies, he denies that I even have depression. He made a habit of hiding my antidepressants from me and even stole most of my bottles and locked them in his closet. I now live many states away from him and he still refuses to hand over my meds. I still remember him sitting me down and guilt-tripping me into watch an anti-medication movie (ProzacNation) with him to try to sway me away from the meds.

I'm 19 now. I've hit a stage in our relationship where I just refuse to talk to him, every conversation we had was just him telling me I'm gonna be a sex slave or a prostitute when I hit 25. There's a lot of bitterness. I dwell a lot on where I'd be right now if I was raised by a normal father. I know that man loves me, and I know he feels at least a sliver of guilt over the way he treated me. I've never gotten an apology, though. And that's what really stings."

\-he told me I should marry someone in my chosen profession instead of pursuing it myself

\-asked me if I really wanted to spend my life doing work so dull

\-asked me what I had that was so special that I could get into the program, when several of my peers are already in it

\-forgets important details about what I am doing currently, despite clearly having told him

This is after a history of full-on physical abuse, neglect and verbal abuse, constantly insisting that everything I do is wrong. He has also talked about me in a sexualized way before. I am not doing great in life, I think largely as a result of abuse and resulting mental health issues. 

Part of me realizes I probably need to go NC but my self-esteem sucks and I am very self-doubting. Also financially dependent. Posting here hoping someone will help me see the forest for the trees."

&#x200B;

I grew up with a N mom, an enabler father, and an enabler younger brother. My entire family is depressed, visibly so, to the point where is had destroyed any positive aspect of their environment. To give you a few examples of the atmosphere of this house:

* My mother smokes constantly inside the house, despite the rest of the family hating it. I am also pretty sure she smoked when she was pregnant with my younger brother.
* She spends every free moment of the day on her computer playing Runescape or facebook games. Requests like ""Can you fill the dogs bowl while we are gone they need food"" get ignored. We come home two hours later to an empty bowl and she has not moved
* The entire house is a disaster zone, and the cleanliness level is zero. Things are put out and not put back, nothing is washed unless my dad does it, the ceilings and walls are stained by cigarette smoke, and the house looks like a mild hoarders episode most of the time.
* My entire family, save me, looks disheveled most/all of the time. I am talking unkempt greasy hair, holes in clothes, rare teeth brushing/showering, etc. We were not taught any kind of personal hygiene as children at all.
* Any attempt to clean or fix things is met with either no help or mild resistance.
* I have to bother people to wash their hands after using the washroom, cooking meat (I am 10 years vegetarian), or other things. I am met with an annoyed sigh, talking under their breath, and them accusing me of being a germaphobe.
* She did not pass highschool and works at a Home Depot. My father lost his business and is currently unemployed.
* I was taught no life skills at all growing up, and have had to fend for myself for the longest time.

As the black sheep of the family I got all of the flack for everything; this is true with many of you I assume. My brother is exactly like them, and is also quite meek. I don't know if meek is the right word, but he runs away from conflict in the family or any other kind of issue. A few years ago my grand mother passed away and wanted to leave each grand child $5000. My mother pocketed our money, and spent $16,000 getting the backyard landscaped. She said that she deserved a treat for herself. I was rightfully angry, but my brother said ""They raised us its the least we can do.""

&#x200B;

In any case my dad just grumbles and leaves the situation. He has stopped fighting her all together and just makes comments about her spending all of her time on the computer, or her being useless and not doing anything. He will never stand up for any of us, and a lot of the time ends up being nice or spoiling us a little bit when shes not looking. Most of the time he is grumpy and miserable though. He wants to move out to eastern Canada, and she has squashed that dream multiple times.  He jokes about dying of a heart attack shortly.

&#x200B;

When I was in highschool she started getting physical with me and I had to push her off of me. I am 6 foot 7, or 200cm for those that use metric. She told her sister, who tried to push her to get me arrested for abuse. Her side of the family shares similar characteristics to her; my cousin was in a business partnership with my dad and stole a large sum of money, cheated their clients, and sold their equipment and ruined the entire thing.

&#x200B;

**Here is a big thing:**  A few years ago I lost 145 pounds. Insane right? I was very proud of myself, and I currently look great. The only thing my mother said was that I better be sure to keep my old clothes. ""Just in case"". And she got angry when I tossed them against her wishes.

&#x200B;

It's this constant lack of support, negative attitude, and just urge to bring me down to their level that kills me. They are miserable, so I guess they feel like I have to be miserable?

&#x200B;

**So....**

&#x200B;

I could rant forever, but it is safe to say that I grew up not feeling like I was enough. I remember being told at a young age that **I am the reason the entire family fights** by my father. My mother is verbally degrading/abusive, and the entire family is negative beyond belief. This house feels like a black hole, and my most recent ex girlfriend hated being here.

&#x200B;

Last year I was away for grad school, living in my own place and I was doing much better. I had to move home for two months, as I was leaving to live in Uganda as of September 1st. That same ex girlfriend noted that I had a marked change in my personality and attitude once I moved back home. I am now back from Uganda, as of Jan 1st, and have been looking for work for what seems like forever. Since I can't find work yet, I have had to live at home and work a part time job for money.

&#x200B;

My girlfriend and I broke up because we were both doing immensely terrible mental health wise and because we needed to work on ourselves. I have been doing better, and have been developing strategies for my mental health. One big one i to tell myself that this won't be a big deal in the end. I'm stuck in traffic or cut off? No big deal I will get there eventually. Problem arises? I'll just work through it and do my best, no big deal. Part of this has been taking walks, meditating, etc. My mother recently has been paranoid about money and about gas and putting KM on the car. I had a bit of a bad evening because of a reddit interaction. Realizing it was stupid I decided to go for a hike a couple streets over - maybe like 5-10km, and I got scolded and told that I can't be using gas. She takes this tone, one that I am sure your N has their own version of, that just tends to get under your skin.

&#x200B;

This has been going on with me going to the gym, or any other kind of action I take. She makes it a point to snoop into all of myself, and ask where I am going and what I am doing at all times. If you dont cater to her whims then she has a fit and stomps around like a child. This has occurred on multiple occasions.

&#x200B;

Once I needed the car for an interview, and she said she needed it for work. I suggested my dad drive her to work, which he was okay with, so I could attend my interview. She whined and complained because *she just liked knowing that her car was sitting the parking lot in case she needed it at any point*.

&#x200B;

Baked cinnamon buns, a 3 hour process, for my friends birthday a few weeks ago. She complained , bitched, and whined that I wouldn't let her have any, and that I wouldn't make a double batch so she could have some. Smh right?

&#x200B;

My entire life has been all about her, and I am stuck here until I can find work and afford to get out on my own again. I am fighting every day to stay positive and not feel stuck, but even the atmosphere in this house is a black hole.  Being here makes me angry, frustrated, and a much worse person than I am. I am generally calm but I feel trapped. I took solace in knowing that I could leave the house, go for a hike or to the gym, but she is seemingly finding a way to trap me here more than she already has. Nobody fights her, nobody does anything, and whenever I try to stand up for anybody I become the villainized bad guy.

&#x200B;

**Questions**

* Do you have any advice based on what you have read?
* How do you step away from an N parent?
* Is there any way to improve the home life, or help the rest of the family a part from leaving entirely?
* What kind of coping mechanisms and tools have helped you mentally get over the affects of your N abuse?

I don't even know what the affects of the N abuse are, ex gf found this subreddit for me and I promised I would post. I am sorry this has been a cluster fuck, I really was unsure whether to classify this as a rant or as an advice request, but I went with advice in the end. This was mainly because I am open to any feedback you might have to improve my situation. I might not be doing it justice, and it might not seem as bad as it is, but I am having the hardest time right now.

&#x200B;

Thank you so much"
95,"""You're being dishonest"", the essential backup plan",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfafdf9828>,Hellvonhelvetti,0,1,6,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536072295.0,9cw91d,"As I am experiencing my teenage years, I wanted to do some things I love and **for once** hang out with normal friends. My parents however, are incredibly suspicious and sort of want me to stay away from all of that, and sort of just focus on studies and hobbies. Their old methods used to consist of asking the biography of the friend and their family, in addition to requesting to meet them, which I wasn't a fan of for obvious reasons, so now, I try to be quiet vague with my descriptions of my friends and escape questions as fast as possible. 

I recently started to get interested in attending sport matches, something which my parents wouldn't really allow me because it takes away from my study time and makes me meet the type of people who'm they do not wish for me to interact with (people that might drink, swear more than usual, etc. but carry much more interesting personalities than people that I meet at school) so in order for me to attend more matches, I would slip in a lie every once in a while in order to get what I desire. The problem is that at times I have sounded dishonest, and now, if I even want to stay at the library for a bit more after school, I would return to ""what's keeping you out late, library? You sound very dishonest, and I refuse to believe you"" at almost every time. 

I once asked my parents how they expect my friendships to be, and they answered with ""just hang out at school, there's no need to hang out after that"" to note further, I can't imagine asking them ever to go to a friend's house, I can't imagine staying out past 7pm, or telling them that a friend of mine has a school average of less than a 9 on a 4-10 scale. My social skills are almost nonexistent due to that, and recently, I have started to notice a trouble in speaking because I do not get many chances to practice speaking and I would have my entire speech systems shut down if I am speaking to more than 3 people at a time or an unknown person. 

I feel so trapped. "

As a kid she conditioned me to be afraid of the outside world, citing kidnappings and murders and awful crimes when I wanted to go play outside or with friends. As I got older, I witnessed my mother physically abusing my younger sister, who was 8-10 at the time. I have a vivid memory of her being slapped across the face and told to go to her room. 

I brought it up last year while in a family therapy session, and to my surprise- she said it never happened. Like, adamantly saying that I was making it up. “Oh I would remember doing that, it would make me so upset if I did!” Coincidentally my dad was on a business trip at the time, and I’m not allowed to talk to my now 13 year old sister about anything. And this happens so much. She even denies really stupid small things. “I didn’t say you were /sick/. I said you were having a /hard time/.” Which is really the dumbest shit because for a long time, I believed that I was fucked up for accusing my loving mom of these atrocities. I had learned that my memory was “less then average” and I had this idea that I wasn’t trustworthy, even to myself. 

She still maintains these principles. The worst part of it is that I crave for her to admit that she’s a liar. My (lovely) therapist keeps telling me that I’m giving my mother power that way, and I know he’s right. It’s just my perception is so fucked up that I have a hard time believing anything unless my mom says it’s true. "
97,"Want to go NC with nmum but don’t want to run away and leave the others to deal with her by themselves, or leave them behind if I can/should help them?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb71e8588>,Eoin2898,0,1,1,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536107237.0,9d1alt,"Sorry a little ranty, not urgent, would love some advice if you have any going spare!

Twin sister realised about nmum years ago, because she was main scapegoat kid
I realised about a month ago
I’m all for going NC

Twin treated worst as kid but hasn’t gone NC
I was golden child till mental health took a nosedive, but still did whatever nmum asked (no matter what) so never overtly abused
So I don’t have clear/definitive explanation for the family for why going NC

Have read from a few different sources that trying to help a narcissist is futile and NC is best/healthiest way to go
Is this true?

I have a twin sister(20), a younger brother(14), and estepdad (who is naturally anxious/low self-esteem so is easily manipulated).
From what I can tell they’re all victims of nmum, so would like to stay in contact w them


I want to go NC with nmum and never go back to family house: only meet up w family elsewhere, and stay in contact by phone
Is that selfish?
Should I stay and actively try to break the others out the cycle of nmum’s emotional abuse? 
Would going NC just be callously leaving them behind to deal with nmum themselves, when actually I could/should help them break out/away?

Twin is the only other person aware of nmum: if brother and estepdad aren’t ‘awake’ yet
Is realising what Nmum is something only they can do for themselves? 
Or is that just a lie/excuse I’m telling myself so I can just run away with minimal guilt?

Nmum is a covert narcissist so I wouldn’t know where to start about telling someone or asking for advice

Don’t want my NC w nmum to make her treat the others worse
Don’t want to run away and leave them to deal with it by themselves

Nmum had a traumatic childhood so being this way is most likely a side effect of that trauma
Does that mean I should try harder to help her be less narcissistic, or does it make no difference?

Sorry for the long post, thank you for reading! Any and all advice very much welcome!"
98,Two NParents,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfafdecb00>,rebecca305402,0,1,0,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536106850.0,9d18vy,"First  off, I want to say thank you for this kind of community. I never  realized a community like this existed until today, and I am so grateful  to have found one.

So last year, I was  accepted into my dream university. It was the university I have wanted  to go to since I was in middle school, and I got accepted AND got into  the program that I wanted to, which was really hard to do. I also got a  lot of scholarships, so I would have covered 70-80% of the costs alone.  My parents did not want to help me cover any costs, so instead of  accumulating student debt, I just went to community college.

Now,  since community college is way cheaper than the university I wanted to  go to, I literally had so much money left over. Now, my mom knows that  and she is like ""You need to give that to your parents! You're going to  spend it all we need to control it! We need to put it into our account!""  I told my mom no I want it to STAY in my account, but she keeps arguing  and threatening to bring my dad into this (who I am afraid of). They  might kick me out or whatever, which I don't mind at this point. I hate  being controlled for everything I do. I got scholarships to go to  college, straight As during my senior year of high school while taking  AP courses, I got a job where I am starting my own business and I'm  becoming successful, but my parents don't congratulate me for anything.  My dad did not even show up to my high school graduation. But now all of  a sudden, when I have some money, they get to take it. They did not pay  A PENNY for my college education, but yet they're entitled to the  money?

I  went and took the SAT MULTIPLE times to get a good score. I'm the one  that stood up till 3 am sometimes studying to make sure that I pass that  test. They literally did nothing. Smh.

And  they're honestly controlling every aspect of my life and it's driving  me insane. I can't stay after class at college to study and it's so  noisy in the house sometimes. They put a tracking device on my phone to  know where I am at all times. It's like I cant breathe without my  parent's permission. This has affected me so much emotionally. People,  even teachers, call my parents insane. I tried working out stuff with  them in the past, but I always end up getting screamed at and verbally  abused. I tried to runaway from my house to a friends, but the friend  ended up bailing on me. I had all my stuff packed and everything, but  she never showed up. When I contacted her about it, she just blocked me.

I don't know what to do anymore. I'm on the brink of insanity."
99,I really don't know what to feel/think. I don't even know if he's an nparent. Is this the right sub?,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfafddf9b0>,Milkshaketurtle79,0,3,3,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536085221.0,9cyafp,"I've posted here on and off. I have a lot of difficulty telling whether or not I belong here. My dad isn't as blatant as a lot of the people described here. In other ways, he fits the definition perfectly.  
He'll tell me to do something I've never done, and yell at me if I don't do it perfectly. He gets off on bossing me around. Even though I'm 19, he's always trying to control how I look, how I do my hair, how I act. He's always got some snide or sarcastic remark about what I'm doing or how I look, but blows up at the smallest criticism.  
I'm trans. He doesn't know it, because he's said he'd disown me ""if"" I were gay or trans. I listened to him go on about how disgusting trans people are.  
We go fishing each summer and stay in a cabin. Instead of changing in the bathroom and wearing pants or even underwear, he sleeps naked and changes out in the open, even when I tell him how uncomfortable it makes me. I know it sounds petty, but it's violating my boundaries.  
He yells at me if I'm using the bathroom when he wants it, even though we have two bathrooms. Until I started locking the door (because he'd yell at me for doing that), he'd always go in and use the bathroom (not just taking a piss either) while I was in the shower. He lies about a lot of small and pointless things if he can take credit for it. For example, I remember learning some fact from tv and telling him, only for him to tell me he told me/that I was trying to take credit for him. He'll do dangerous things and basically insist that they're okay/safe because he's doing it- for example, texting and driving, or burning the garden down to get rid of weeds without putting out the fire.   



But I guess the reason I'm confused is because he's not directly manipulative? Like, at least from what I can remember, he's never done anything like breaking something explicitly so he can blame me. But he's definitely verbally abusive. Whenever he's around, I try to avoid him. And a lot of times, I don't feel safe around him, both because of his recklessness, and his obsession with being this tough, toxically masculine guy with a gun on him 24/7.
