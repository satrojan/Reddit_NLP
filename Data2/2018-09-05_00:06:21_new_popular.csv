3,What is with the fences?,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb6019780>,Stancliff,0,1,1,False,askcarsales,,1536120303.0,9d2vg6,"Hey r/Askcarsales, 

I gotta say, this is one of my favorite subs. I enjoy all the jokes & negative iggy stories. I actually stopped my brother from ruining his life with a Journey purchase thanks to this sub. I actually told him, “ This Journey will be the worst decision in your life, and you’ve been divorced twice”. 

Anyhow, I had a question. I live pretty close to an auto mall, and I see the dealership put up chain link fences around their lots from time to time. I notice it’s normally around the used car side of the lot’s dealership. My question is, why? Does this actually work? I don’t understand the purpose. Does this make potential buyers think there are extra deals or something? 

Thanks in advance !

I notice that one tech in particular never deals with customers and she’s the senior pharmacy tech. To me this seems unfair, but again. Nobody explained work flow to me so I wouldn’t know. She’ll go a whole shift without ringing a single person up. It doesn’t seem right to me. When I come in for the mid shift I stay up front and juggle between the front registers and the drive thru by myself with little help from the other techs. I’ve begun to sense that they just don’t want to deal with customers. I’ve tried looking on store net for a good breakdown of work flow, but haven’t found anything conclusive.

I have a full on 100 watt tube amp and need additional amp for home for practice, writing and I'd like to be able to connect to my DAW (Logic Pro X) to lay down demos and so forth. So I have a few questions:

- Any Preference of the 50 (1x12) or 100 (1x12)? 

- Is the 1x12 speaker in either model a true FRFR speaker? Or is it close enough to one?

- If I wanted could I play another amp modeler or even a synth through the Katana? I use synths in my stuff and it would be awesome to have this as a means to play synths through live or practice. 

- Direct Recording: Can you record direct? And if so is the USB or Rec Out better for that?

- Sneaky Amps: I've read mention of this and I'm wondering exactly what it is. Is it actually that the amp models are in the Katana natively or are these 3rd party add ons?

- Patches: Also seen this but I was wondering what they are exactly. 

- Overall thoughts on functionality of the amp for play and recording. 

Thanks. "

I’ve been staying in a dorm for the past week and it’s just been really uncomfortable for me. Do you recommend sticking it out for the “college experience” or should I just do what I’m comfortable with and commute?

Genre:  RPG 

Estimated year of release: 2005? Idk 

 Graphics/art style: Chibi characters if I remember correctly Notable 

Notable gameplay mechanics: I remember there being some type of card collectible. I also remember choosing a faction at the beginning and travel around the overworld fighting guys from other factions 

&#x200B;

Basically I'm looking for an old flash game that had a bunch of different factions to choose from. It was sci-fi themed maybe even steampunk.  From what I remember it was a typical 2D RPG game. Any help is appreciated.

Never in my wildest dreams did I think or imagine myself in the situation I find myself in right now. To this very minute I cannot fathom the chance I got to spend the day with you on Friday and to be included in a family gathering to boot. If I could go back in time and tell 8th grade me that this just happened, I guarantee you that I would’ve called you crazy or insane. If I thought it was enamoured with you back when, then I don’t know what to call how I feel about you now, in the future as adults. 

It’s surreal for me to sit here as now, a grown man, having gone through many many trials and much adversity in life, most of it completely unaware of you and your existence. Until suddenly one day, there you were, and before I knew it, we had spent some 3 hours talking over text. And the same things I felt as a young kid, I now felt again, as an adult. There was something different about it, I can only conclude that it was the age comparison to grade school, versus being a man, close to 30. Life may have made us feel weak in some moments, and stronger in others, but nothing prepares me to feel how I felt as I left you last Friday night after spending such a wonderful day with you and your family. I thank the gods I pray to for that day, for it made me feel a happiness I’ve not felt in such a long time. I highly doubt you’ll ever read this, but thank you C. I’m going to be here for you, to support you and be a shining light in your darkest hours when you think there isn’t one. Despite all that’s going on with me and my crazy, asinine life, you’re still here. Perhaps one day, you and I can share the same feelings for one another. Until then, I will be steadfast in my ways. 

Eternally, K. "
