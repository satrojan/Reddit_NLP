5,Just sayin' hi...,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb5d6ecc0>,RosalineKyleAllen,0,3,10,False,GayChristians,Lesbian Christian / Side B,1536115808.0,9d2cbq,"I grew up in a super-conservative church and family, with the assumption that everyone was straight. Because of course they were. Conservative Christians would rather their kids didn't know gay *existed*. If they don't know it's a thing, they can't be it, right? Haha wrong.

Shock horror when fourteen-year-old me finds all my friends are into boys and I am... excruciatingly *not*. 'Lesbian' hadn't even occurred to me as a thing I could be, because the whole idea that I or anyone I knew *might* be LGBT was suppressed, repressed, back-into-the-closet-you-perv pressed. 

I described it for a long time as 'serious case of the boy cooties'. I was a LGBT-hating little asshole as a kid. I'm still going around apologizing for things I said. Please don't assume all haters are in the closet, that's kinda dangerous, but I was.

Concluded I must be asexual. Because hetero sex is the only kind there is, right? Haha wrong.

Started college, got unsupervised internet access, discovered that it was in fact possible to be gay and Christian, and all those weird feelings about my female friends didn't mean I was on a one-way trip to hell. It's been a long mission unrepressing a lot of who I am, but I think I've found most of her now.

So. Here I am. I am a Christian and a lesbian. I really love Jesus, one particular woman, icecream, science, and owls.

Peace."

8,The Daily Struggles of An Immortal (Part 17),<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb5e93860>,KurtisEckstein,0,4,9,False,AuthorKurt,,1536115910.0,9d2csi,"# << [Part 16](https://www.reddit.com/r/AuthorKurt/comments/9d0pee/the_daily_struggles_of_an_immortal_part_16/)

My own personal fashion show. I had really let my mind run wild the rest of the way to Freya’s office, prompting Lily to tell me their plans, since our vampiric friend was going to assume she had snitched anyway. I immediately apologized. “Sorry. I can’t help it that I’m a guy, and you’re both *super* hot.”

She sighed, rolling her eyes as we pulled into the parking lot. “I’m sure you’d love *that*, but I’m not into that sort of thing.” She then grinned at me. “Although, I will admit I’m not the only one modeling this evening.”

I stared at her in disbelief. “You really want me to watch her show off her body?”

She groaned at my one-track mind. “It’s a *fashion* show Sam!”

“And I’m a very healthy male!” I retorted. “You can’t honestly believe the clothing is going to be my only focus.” I scoffed. “I would never normally go to such a thing for that very reason.” I wasn’t sure why I was being so honest with her, knowing she might change her mind. But then again, I had always been fairly honest with her.

Thus far, she had refrained from asking how it was going with Freya, so of course I hadn’t told her that her friend was sitting on my face regularly again, but I probably would have been truthful if she had asked directly.

Lily parked the car, and then held my gaze for a moment, evaluating my expression. I wasn’t sure what was on her mind, but after a few seconds she finally spoke. “I’m okay if you look at her,” she whispered. “Just no touching.”

I gawked at her again, feeling hesitant. “I didn’t realize fashion shows involved touching in the first place.”

She grinned. “Oh, this one will for sure!”

I stared at her in disbelief. “You’re going to turn me on in front of her?! That’s so cruel!”

“To who?” She asked innocently. “You or her?”

“Both!” I exclaimed. “And I thought you said you weren’t into that kind of thing?!”

Her grin widened. “I never said anything about her watching.”

Damn…she had a point…

Wait…

Shit! Was she serious right now?!

A tap on my window abruptly startled me. I whipped my head around to see Freya peering in with a look of annoyance. I followed her gaze, realizing she was looking at my lap.

“Lily!” She whined, her voice muffled by the glass. “It was supposed to be a surprise!” She then stomped her foot and pouted, her red eyes deceptively innocent looking.

I held up my hands in defense as Freya opened the car door. “Hey!” I exclaimed, deciding to lie. “I still don’t know what’s going on!”

Freya glared at me, her thin fingers wrapping gently around my neck, her voice cold. “Don’t lie to me Sam, or else I’ll force myself on you as punishment.”

I gulped, wondering in what universe anyone would consider that to be punishment. I guess it wouldn’t be so great if she tore out my neck at the same time. Knowing her, she probably would, since her arousal always manifested as a bloodlust first.

Lily immediately cleared her throat. “Freya, we had a deal remember? Keep your paws off my man until *after* I’m dead.”

Freya smirked at her, a knowing look in her eye. “Oh, alright,” she said sweetly. “I’ll be good.”

Yeah right, if only she knew.

Freya then grabbed me by the arm and hoisted me out of the seat onto my feet. “You’re going to love this!” She said cheerfully. “I’ve made five new outfits for her, four of which are just for normal day activities, but I made a special one just for you!”

The fact that all Lily's clothing was made of colored FRIL, looking like latex or vinyl, made almost everything she wore seem seductive. However, the lump in my throat reappeared again, knowing what she really meant was that she had made something sexy for Lily for the bedroom. Wow, this was awkward. “And what about you?” I asked hesitantly, wanting to change the subject. “Aren’t you modeling too?”

Freya glared at me. “I knew you were lying,” she hissed. She then abruptly crossed her arms over her chest and sighed. She was quiet for a moment as her expression dropped slightly. “Yeah, I kind of wanted to show some new styles off as well. Really, it’s for Lily to give me her opinion, although I’d like yours too if that’s alright.” She seemed vulnerable again as she glanced at me from the corner of her eye.

I nodded immediately, my hormones calming down some by her need for my approval. “Of course.” I then hesitated. “Although, I’m probably not the best person to ask about fashion.”

She shrugged. “All you have to do is tell me how I look.”

I smirked at her. “Still not going to be helpful then. You could wear a trash bag and still look amazing.”

Freya immediately grinned, leaning towards me, only for Lily to interrupt. She was suddenly at my side, ensnaring my arm against her large chest. “Okay Sam, enough compliments already. Too many and it will go to her head.”

Freya put her hands on her hips and *humphed*. “I’ve been starved for compliments all three-hundred and fifty-seven years of my life!”

Lily rolled her eyes. “*Please.* You’ve been starved for *sex*. You get plenty of compliments.”

“Umm…Lily,” I began, feeling uneasy about Freya’s death glare. “That’s not very helpful.”

Lily immediately tapped her chin, acting innocent. “Hmm, good point.” She then smirked at me again. “But she’ll get plenty from you soon enough.”

I stared at her in disbelief, knowing she was probably referring to after she died, which made me slightly depressed, but unexpectedly finding myself wondering if she had something else in mind."

Several Fenway EMS were attending to someone collapsed on the floor that was quickly becoming a critical situation.  I saw chest compressions starting before we were ushered out to give the professionals room.  Whatever the outcome of the patient, just want you to know that you are doing a great job.  Thank you for keeping us safe!

Also, friend I don’t know who you are or where you’re from, but I hope you stay with us awhile longer.  Get well.

I said what’s up and he looked afraid I was gonna be an overbearing fan, so instead I just asked him if he knew where the Carhartt store was (my phone had just died) and he told me which way to go. I didn’t want to bother him (plus the store was closing in 20 min) so I just said thanks and walked away. I heard him call out, “Yo, have a good one!” as I walked away and I turned around and said “Yeah you too.”

Anyways just wanted to share that lol. I hope he was left thinking, “Damn that was a super casual encounter.”"
