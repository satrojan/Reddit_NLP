12,[RANT] She may not make it to our wedding.,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb607d6d8>,th3thirdimpact,0,15,10,False,weddingplanning,,1536151878.0,9d68bl,"Sorry for the petty rant, but writing it down will make me stop being irritated about it. My sister has become obsessed with her kid's sports team, to the point where her entire life now seems to revolve around it. It's great that it makes her happy, but sometimes I feel like she expects everyone else to plan their lives around it, too. We aren't able to go on any vacations as a family anymore because they need to spend every single weekend at tournaments and my parents are expected to be there for all of them as well.

&#x200B;

Last week my fiance and I announced our wedding date. Instead of a congratulations, any excitement, or even a smile, she just goes ""oh, well we may have a tournament that day"". Of course I was bummed, but I understand that this particular tournament is a big one (even though it is for children...). That was, until I find out that this tournament is a week long.... she couldn't miss one day of a sport that she goes to see almost every single week for her only sister's wedding???? Also, this is one that could happen at any point during the summer months - they just won't know until later this year. Sorry, but I'm not going to change the entire season of my wedding for one guest. She kept making us feel guilty about having the wedding next year. My dad clearly got annoyed with her too, and goes ""people plan their weddings around what is convenient for THEM, not for other people"". My fiance snapped at her ""I guess we should have waited an entire extra year on the off chance you guys have a tournament"". But come one, they honestly have something that is ""really important for \*sport\*"" like once a month. 

&#x200B;

She was super cold and standoffish the entire rest of the day. She actually seemed visibly angry with me and avoided all wedding talk between the rest of the family. She previously claimed she had a huge pinterest board made for when we started planning, but now claims ""there aren't that many pins on it"" - which I think she just deleted it or doesn't want to share it. It really seems like she is angry at us for the date we picked!!! I'm hurt by situation and how she made it all about her. I guess I just wish she would have at least tried to act semi-happy for us instead of tried to make me feel bad. Honestly, there wasn't even any reason for her to tell us until they know the official date of the tournament. I mean come on, what are the odds that it would actually be that day anyway?

&#x200B;

I'll probably delete this soon but thanks for letting me vent to you guys and gals. It helped :)"
13,Neither of my parents are invited and I regret nothing,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb60a6710>,twoshai,0,7,35,False,weddingplanning,20th September 2018,1536125203.0,9d3doi,"Probably going to be a long post, bear with me if you can. 

I experienced one of those ""rough"" childhoods. My mother was 17 when she had me and my father was 32. They were both addicts and my father abused my mother. They split when I was 2 and my father won full custody of me. I was then abused until I was 14, when I ran away and reported the abuse. Unfortunately after investigation it was deemed I was making up the allegations for attention. After living in a youth refuge I was eventually put back into my father's care. I moved out when I was 15, developed my own drug addiction, dropped out of high school and ended up in a relationship pretty reminiscent of my mother and father's from 18-21. 

My father basically brainwashed me against my mother and her side of the family so we weren't particularly close when I was growing up. Not for their lack of trying. My mother ended up developing a schizo affective disorders after losing custody of me and our relationship has always been a bit difficult to navigate. 

When I was 22 I made the decision to finally cut my father out of my life completely. I had broken up with my boyfriend and it acted like a catalyst for me to try to turn everything around. I eventually was diagnosed with chronic melancholic depression, SAD, GAD, PTSD and agoraphobia. I knew our relationship needed to end if I were to have any chance at recovery. 

This meant that I basically lost all my father's side of the family. Nothing overt, we just fell out of touch because he was always around and I didn't want to be near him. My relationship with my mother's side however had improved greatly, but my mum is very sick and one of her delusions is that they aren't her real family, so still a strain there. Haven't seen my mum in 13 years. I'm 27 now.

So anyway, my fiance proposed to me Feb 2017 and our wedding is this month, 20th September. I had a really hard time trying to figure out if I should invite the family, mum and father. I thought I'd use the engagement party as an olive branch and not a single member of my father's side came. He wasn't invited, as I was fairly certain I wasn't going back there. After that, I sent them a group message letting them know I had come to the decision that I wouldn't be extending an invite, that I was hurt that they were standing by my abuser and that..  well I missed them.

Wow did I get abused like nothing else. My inbox blew up with detriment and threats. I now work as a Mental Health Advocate and they contacted my workplace to tell them I was a fraud. I ended up experiencing psychogenic seizures due to the stress. The response as expected but it still hurt so goddamn much. Especially because they said I was hurting them all, but no-one cared that I'd been hurting. These people actually saw the abuse, cleaned me up after, and were now calling me a liar. 

Anyway, it was one of the most horrible things I've ever experienced. BUT. With the wedding two weeks out I am so relieved I bit the bullet. I'll be surrounded only by those that love me. Including one aunt from his side that always stuck by me - and my entire mother's side of the family. I haven't invited mum, she's so sick and I don't think she could handle the stress. It breaks my heart for her, but I've never really had a mum so I'm feeling ok about it. I feel like I'd be too concerned about her staying well throughout the day if she were invited, and she'd likely not be okay with her family there so it's for the best. 

If you're struggling with something similar, just trust me, do what's best for you. It sucks that such a beautiful moment in your life can act as a catalyst for this sort of thing, but believe me, it's worth it. I don't have to worry about dynamics at all, just being with the people I love."

I happily paid assuming that the cost covered the price of the rental. The bride also mentioned that she and the groom would be providing alcohol, snacks, and transportation. Great! Sounds reasonable.

Well, shortly thereafter, we come to find out that the houses were a gift, and provided to the couple free of charge. Which basically means that the bridal party is covering all of the alcohol, snacks, and transportation, and also providing an enormous amount of extra money to the bride and groom. Without our consent or knowledge. 

I am so hurt and upset that after spending so much time and effort and money into hosting an engagement party, bridal shower, and bachelorette party, I'm also now covering expenses that I never agreed to because the free house was kept secret. 

Is this normal? Am I crazy for being furious? What would you do? "

24,Major issues with venue 1 month out from Oct. 6th wedding! Help!

This is going to be long, but I can’t figure out a way to shorten it and still include all the issues, so I’m sorry in advance.

First off, we are getting married at a historical hotel that has done many, many weddings in the past. 

A coworker of mine’s parents owned this hotel for the last 35 years, but sold it last summer to two real estate guys from DC. Let’s go back to a year and a half ago (that summer), when my fiancé and I drove the hour away from our home and met with the hotel staff right after they sold it. Literally a week after it got sold. We ended up doing a walk through with both the old owners and the new owners and the new owners told us that 1.) There were going to be many renovations to the hotel to make it look nicer, and the renovations would definitely be done before our wedding; and 2.) that if we signed a contract now, we could get the old owner’s prices since they were going to eventually increase with all the new changes to the hotel. We did not get his word in writing, and that was our fault, but we did not know any better. 

In the next few days, I decided to go with them and called the inn, and the old owner answered and said if we sent in a deposit check for the reservation of the date, that she would write down that we’ve reserved that day. So, I mailed the $250 check. 

A month after that, we went to the Inn to sign the contract and go over everything. The old owner had fully left and we met up with one of the new owners. We did not sign anything at that time because we had not chosen the food we wanted yet/how many people we were going to have and so they said we could come back after figuring it all out and sign a contract then. 

A month goes by and I get an email from the new event coordinator who we hadn’t met yet. She said we could figure out the details through email since we live so far away from the Inn. So I told her what all we wanted and things seemed to be working out fine. 

A few months go by, and I email the coordinator about signing a contract and get no response for a week. I also emailed the Inn’s general email and got no response as well. I work 12 hour nights, so emailing is really my most convenient form of communication. So I called the Inn a few days after getting no response from the general email, and they stated that they had fired the event coordinator and had just recently hired a new one. So we made an appointment to meet with the new coordinator the next week. 

We meet up with her and she tells us that the old coordinator threw away or hid important documents such as confirmed wedding dates, contracts, deposits, etc. So they had no idea what date we reserved nor if we had actually paid the deposit. She said the old coordinator also caused so much financial damage that the renovations were not going to happen. Big red flag,but, knowing that there were very little options for other venues at this point, we still went on with them. We went over all the details we had already told them once before, and paid the first portion of the deposit and reserved our hotel rooms there as well. 

The details weren’t ironed out completely (appetizers, dinner choices, how the tables and chairs were going to be set up), so we met up with the coordinator a month after that and she wrote down all the things we decided, we paid the entire amount left in full, and everything seemed to be going fine. Keep in mind, we were like 10 months out so neither us nor the Inn were really in a hurry to iron out the very fine details such as alcohol brands. 

Two weeks ago, I emailed the coordinator about which brands we wanted. That was the last thing we had left to decide. She emailed me back stating that she was “going to email me soon” to let me know that she no longer works there.  She stated that if we wanted her to work the wedding that she still would, however. We didn’t get any sort of notification from the hotel about this. This is the 2nd time the Inn has failed to notify us when their coordinators don’t work there anymore. 

I called the Inn and the new coordinator, who I guess is also the GM, could only meet with us on a day that I worked. So we called this Monday to set an appointment up for Tuesday afternoon and the receptionist said that was fine. Tuesday morning the receptionist calls my mom (she made the appointment) and states that he won’t be in to work today because of a “doctor’s appointment”. When my mom got upset and basically was ripping the receptionist a new asshole (because she is only one there that is able to speak with us!), the receptionist let it out that the only information they had about our wedding was the date and how many people. Not our food choices, alcohol, nothing. 

So, I got a hold of the old coordinator and she said that they hadn’t contacted her either to get any information from her about the wedding details. And she said she thought that was messed up because the new coordinator has never been an event coordinator and has never done a wedding before in that job. She said she had also heard through the grapevine that they don’t have a current liquor license and that now they only operate on the weekend (they have a restaurant in the hotel open to the public) instead of every day of the week. If this is true, I’m worried that not only will we not get to serve alcohol, but if we’re even going to be able to have a wedding there at all. 

The next day we can meet with them where both my and my mom’s work schedules meet up are Sept. 15th, just 3 weeks out from the wedding. 

Basically I’m wanting advice on how to act when I meet up with them, and what I can legally demand (I want the old coordinator to work my wedding, but I don’t think it’s right that I would have to pay her personally; she knows what she’s doing better than the new coordinator and we’ve been with her almost this entire time). Also, should I bring records of emails I’ve had between them since the beginning? I am bringing a copy of the contract we signed with the old coordinator but I don’t know what else I could bring to make it seem more professional and also like I’m not afraid to sue them if we don’t get the things we’ve paid for. I don’t want to be so rude that they do things during the wedding out of spite, but I want them to treat this with the seriousness it deserves and make it up to us in some way. I don’t think I’m asking much to have the old coordinator work my wedding since they’ve messed everything up so far, but I don’t think I can legally demand that they allow her to do it. All I want is for the wedding to go as smoothly as it can. 

Please help me. "

We said from the beginning that the most important thing to us was to throw an awesome party. So we focused our money on making sure people would be fed and plied with drinks, that the music would be great, and that we had a venue that would provide a good setting for a party.

I had no bouquet (and thus no bouquet toss). No flowers anywhere at the ceremony site or in the reception venue. We let his mom handle table decorations, which were pretty simple (but pretty!). We had no guest book, and did almost no DIY (basically just favors and name cards) and let the existing venue decorations dominate the setting. We didn't have any reception games (despite this being something heavily expected by his side of the family, as for them weddings are about the entertainment). 

And the end result was that we had a fucking blast, and so many of our friends and family did, too. The reception went from 6 pm to 2 am and it wasn't dull for a single second. In the days since our wedding on Saturday, my favorite thing has been hearing stories about who everyone talked to and what previously non-existant connections were made between people from different parts of our lives (like my parents finally getting to meet my husband's incredible friend circle or my US-based friends finally getting to meet my German-based friends). Our goal for this wedding was to surround ourselves with the people who loved us and whom we loved back, and give them a night to finally meet each other and socialize with us over food, drinks and music. And we achieved this goal a thousand times over.

I'll post a more thorough recap somewhere down the line, but for now, I just want to let those of you who are feeling similarly to how I was: if you don't want to care about things like flowers or centerpieces or making the perfect guest book, or anything else - you don't have to. I skipped so much, and I don't regret a single thing.

We don’t have a whole of interests in common. We are very different in terms of what we like to do with our free time but one thing we do share is our love of Avatar The Last Airbender. 

We were thinking maybe we could make that our theme but overall it seems either too ComiCon or

Then yesterday, FH tells me that FMIL wants a clear cover for the quilt she made us: some quilt back story: FMIL decides we are having a  chuppah for our secular wedding - we never told her we wanted this.  She then makes us a KING SIZE quilt to use for the chuppah.  FH says thank you we love it (we don't) but that we are not having a chuppah and we already made an arch that we love. There is crying there is not speaking to us, there is all sorts of stuff that i wont get into. So i come up with a plan to use the quilt as a table cloth for our wine ceremony, teh table will be out the entire ceremony but off to the side.  That table will then be used for the guest book after the ceremony so that it is out for people to see all night.  This is a compromise everyone is good with. to protect the quilt i bought a small white water resistant square that only covers the table top, she didnt know about this when she asked for the cover and FH didnt realize it was water resistant and would in fact protect it. I said to him yesterday, that ia m too tired to go on a hunt for this thing and buy yet another thing that she is demanding (its been on going) and that what we have will just have to do and thats that. thankfully he agrees.

&#x200B;

As for fuck it bucket items: we had originally planned to design itineraries and things to do pages for the welcome bags that FMIL insisted she be in charge of. Well I threw it in the bucket because she still hasnt even asked us for ""things to do"" so i dont think she is planning on having anything... and I want it off of my plate (she is not from here and will likely just google stuff - but there is a target  AMC theater, and a shopping mall with 20+ restaurants less than 1/4 mile from the hotel/venue so i feel like people can figure out what stuff to do on their own and the website and their invites all have an itinerary so it is what it is.

&#x200B;

Im tired - anyone else?"

I didn’t do a bridesmaid proposal or anything, I just kind of told them this was the plan and they were both happy with it! 

BM #1 is my oldest friend, we don’t speak every day and it can be months between meet ups but we both know we are there for each other, and we have got each other through a lot! 

BM#2 is also a long term friend, we speak every day and she is almost more excited than the groom about the wedding! 

Since then though, I’ve become really close with another girl, who’s the partner of my fiancé’s good friend. We speak every day, she’s been really supportive and helped out with things at home when I’ve been unwell, changed jobs, had to work away. She’s been to wedding fayre’s with me, attended family events that BM #1 hasn’t and just been generally really involved in our lives. 

I would love her to be involved in the wedding, but I have a couple of reservations which may be stupid, which is where you come in! 

First of all, I’ve known her less than a year. If I ask her to be my bridesmaid I’m unsure if the other two will be upset or feel less important. I’ve mentioned it to both of them and they have been supportive, but I don’t want either of them to feel pushed out or replaced by the new girl! 

Secondly, she is BM at another two weddings within a few months of ours, and she’s spoken to me about how stressful it might be! I know that there’s not much left to organise at my own wedding, so all she would have to do is help pick the pretty dresses, but I don’t want her to feel pressured into saying yes. 

Am I just over thinking this and ask her? Or do I just let her be involved without actually having her as BM? 

TL;DR I’m worried asking my new friend to be BM will upset my other two, and cause her extra stress. "

I know I might get some flack for this but I have to let it out to someone besides FH and my sister. TL;DR at the bottom.

&#x200B;

For reference we are all late 20's - early/mid 30's aged.

&#x200B;

On Saturday my sister (MOH) threw us a bridal shower. Since neither I nor FH have a ton of female family in the area, we decided to do a co-ed couples shower instead. My sister (and entire family) did an amazing job, everything was so well planned and looked amazing, there was SO much food, it was nice for our families to finally meet our friends and vice versa. I'm so incredibly thankful for everything our families did and have done, we totally felt their support and they were our rock the whole day.

&#x200B;

Our friends, not so much. 

&#x200B;

My sister asked different bridesmaids and groomsmen to bring different things, instead of having everyone chip in monetarily or split the cost of the party. She (IMO) very much undershot what she could have asked people to bring, and instead opted to make it easier on them by having them bring smaller (but still important) items. A card game we all love from one bridesmaid, two bouquets of simple grocery store flowers from another, a case of beer from each of the guys, small amounts of ice. 

&#x200B;

The best man, my FH's best friend in the whole world for almost 10 years, brought a medium-sized (like an 18 pack) case of the absolute cheapest beer you can buy. When we play beer pong we don't even use this beer - I had never drank it before, I never thought it was even on any of our friends' radar. And no we aren't talking Coors or PBR, think Naty Ice or Steele Reserve. He was the first of the groomsmen to arrive so for a while we only had that beer (plus wine and other drinks) for a while, and I was so embarrassed offering those to our other guests as they arrived. 

This happened quite a few times:

""Hey bridalshowersadness, is there beer?""

""Yes! It's in the cooler on the patio!""

""Oh, the \[cheap beer that most of us have never drank before in our lives\]?""  
""Yeah I think that's all there is at the moment, sorry!""

No one said anything about it of course, and I'm thankful that he did help us out by bringing drinks, it's just hard for it not to feel.... passive aggressive? Why now, of all times, bring this worst brand of beer, when he knew that he was going to be meeting some of our family for the first time, he knew this was our once-in-a-lifetime bridal shower not just a random summer potluck, and he had heard how much effort my sis was putting into this? He's brought over larger amounts of better beer for a regular old movie night. He makes good money and has a lot of disposable income so it's not a money issue. And like I said, I wasn't expecting him to bring a keg of the highest percentage craft IPA - even the same amount (although I don't get why you wouldn't bring a 36 pack if you're bringing the cheapest beer....) of Miller Highlife or Budweiser would have been totally fine. 

&#x200B;

There were also TEN no-shows, of people that had been saying how excited they were to go up until a few days before. One friend even messaged me on instagram last Thursday to confirm this was a shower and not just a party. Then he just doesn't show up. So he checked to make sure this is an important life event and not just a Labor Day BBQ, and he still flaked. 

&#x200B;

The worst part, and this is the brattiest part that I feel the worst about being upset over, is that we received three gifts out of almost 30 guests, and one of them was from my mom. Literally none of our bridal party brought a gift or card. I expected a few people to show up without, as a few are more immature for their age, but almost everyone? Numerous of the guests are married, have been married, or have thrown bridal showers themselves. We've given bridal and baby shower gifts for many of them within the past few years. They should have known - they MUST have known? Our registry info was on the invitation, clear as day. We have gifts as low as $3 on our registry. A signed card with no other gift inside would have been great!

&#x200B;

My mom and FMIL really wanted us to open gifts in front of everyone like a traditional shower, and now I'm so, so glad we didn't set time aside from that. That would have been humiliating. 

&#x200B;

I totally understand if you don't believe me, but I swear I am NOT a materialistic person AT ALL. Sure I was excited at the thought of getting new things for our home, but the party itself IS what I was excited for. I actually had an amazing time at the party and wasn't upset at all until after everyone left; my sister told us to open our presents and relax, and there were only three sitting there. Even then I was like ""oh, weird"" and it wasn't until we were driving home that it hit me how little I felt cared for. Sure, the people who love us most showed up for us, celebrated with us, ate and drank. That is nice, it makes my heart happy. But it just feels like we aren't deserving of the same effort and courtesy that other people receive. Like we're more than good enough to plan parties for other people, and give them thoughtful gifts, and be there to listen to all of their problems, and help them move and give them rides. But we aren't good enough to have those people throw us a semi-traditional event before a huge milestone in our lives. 

&#x200B;

These are people we've known for years and years. If it wasn't a BBQ with alcohol, but a more standard ""stuffy"" bridal shower, I wonder if any of them would have even come at all. It's the lack of effort that hurts, not the amount of physical things we can hold. I feel like everyone was excited at the thought of me throwing a party (I used to throw huge, fun themed parties before we moved into a smaller place) and didn't even think about the reason FOR the party.

&#x200B;

Thank you for letting me vent you guys. I really do know that gifts are optional and not a requirement, etc etc etc. I swear I do. I just feel so weird because I can't even vent to my best friends and bridal party about this, so I'm very thankful to have this community. Hopefully you can understand the odd feeling of being so appreciative and so hurt at the same time. It's confusing and shocking and I feel so stupid for even making a registry or for getting so excited for the party. Which then makes me feel terrible cause my sis and family did such a great job. I'll get over this in a few days, but for now it still stings. 

&#x200B;

For the people who were no shows: I'm thinking about calming down a bit more, and then revisiting the wedding guest list in a few weeks. These are people we considered close friends, who all found something better to do this weekend (and no, none of them had emergencies or anything that came up. They posted on instagram while they drank at local restaurants during the shower.) Thoughts?

&#x200B;

TL;DR: We received almost no gifts at our shower and we feel unloved by our guests' lack of effort. Now I'm feeling confused, hurt and embarrassed, and unsure where to go from here.

We aren't planning on getting married until 2020, so we have two years to plan, but I feel like we are supposed to know more details already. 
We both like the idea of a small and simple ceremony, just parents, siblings and three or four close friends. We we're thinking of having a large reception the next day for extended family (we have a LOT of family), friends, coworkers and all the plus ones, but I'm feeling a little push back already with the grandparents and extended family who want to be at the actual ceremony... I guess I never thought they would feel left out, this is my first engagement after all! 
I guess my main question would be, to avoid hurting feelings, would it be easier to have a ceremony/reception combo? Or stick to having the two separate? What is most common? Any thoughts and ideas are appreciated! I am very excited and just need direction. "

Bad News the couple broke up recently but both asked if they were still invited to the wedding.  which of course! then they each asked if they could each bring a different date... but.. unfortunately I literally do not have room for two more people. There are already more people coming than I wanted! (170 vs. my original goal of 150) and honestly I don't want to buy two extra 200$ dinners for strangers just so they can one up each other (plus they will know a ton of people at the wedding). we spoke about it in person and they said they understood but if room opened up let them know if they can each bring dates. 

Each one RSVP'ed yesterday.

 One private messaged me that she was really excited but just asked to sit with one mutual friend in particular (also invited). Absolutely no problem!

The other one managed to change HIS NAME on our online RSVP system into his new (female) roommate's name and RSVP'ed yes for HER. then e-mailed me to say that it was weird he was only able to rsvp for her but obviously he will be coming too so i should fix that in my system. Wait.. What??  I checked my online guest list and he has been completely removed and replaced by this new girl (who i have never met). I have no idea how he was able to just change everything about HIS invite. but he did.

I wrote him back that unfortunately we talked about this- I would add him back onto our list but that his roommate wasn't invited at this time. if I have enough room after all the RSVP's come in, i'll let him know and he can add her as his plus one then, but as of now it doesn't look like he will be able to have a date as we previously discussed. Venue limits + cost its just not realistic for us. he basically said fine if she's not coming, i'm not coming.

Which. okay... don't come? but i'm really annoyed by the whole scenario. seriously the balls on him to see there is no plus one (as we discussed IN PERSON) so to just edit his roommate onto the list in place of him and email me that there is a mistake and hes not on the list anymore.. like come on. sneaky way of trying to make sure you get a date. And I'm the bad guy?

I'm justified in being annoyed right? anyone else have to deal with a breakup on their guest list?

I had met the bride once at a party, never met the groom. My FH went to high school with both, and was good friends with the bride for years. So when she messaged me asking for our address, I was really excited! A few weeks pass and we recieved a STD addressed only to our roomates, A & D, who are also friends with the bride (neither have met the groom either). So we were confused, as the bride specifically reached out to me for our address. We waited for the invited to see what the final decision was. Our roommates again recieved formal invites, and we did not get anything. Three weeks later we get an invite for ""drinks and dancing"" after the reception. So our feelings were hurt because we understood we were the B list. I understand that the bride was in a hard position because we have roommates she wanted to invite too. But I think it would have been more appropriate to reach out to the other couple instead of me for the address. In the end, with bride approval, I went with my roommate A to the ceremony & reception, and my FH and D joined us after for drinks and dancing (they had a prior commiment). 

&#x200B;

Overall, it was a cute wedding. The couple looked very happy, their love was obvious! So more of a breakdown: 

**Ceremony:**

* It was at a casino, so we had to drive a bit to find a parking spot. We also weren't sure what door would be the best to enter so we just guessed and then followed signs once we were inside. 
* Once we found the correct event room, we had no idea what to do. Bridal part were walking in and out, some people were sitting inside, some outside the room. We decided to go get a drink to kill time. Once we got back we talked with a few other friends outside the room. There was a miscommunication as to if drinks were allowed in or not. We were told to finish ours before entering. Yet once we went in, about half the people in there had drinks. Very confusing. 
* The room was a standard event center room. They put up curtains behind them in their bridal colors and some string lights. 
* Chairs were comfortable and spaced well. Didn't feel cramped or too close to the person next to me. 
* The music didn't have the fade out, so noticeable silence as we waited and during the processional. 
* Ceremony was sweet. A lot of puns/metaphors which the couple seemed to enjoy. They had a sand unity ceremony. The vows were the repeat after me, but sounded like they still incorperated their own ideas into. It didn't sound like ones I've heard before. 
* Recieving line was right at the end of the aisle. Ushers dismissed by rows. It look a while because it was a large wedding. Bride told us later that 240 invited. 

**Reception:** 

* After the recieving line, we were ushered into the connected room where the reception was. 
* We didn't know if, or how long, the cocktail hour was. There was no seating chart/table assignments. No signs for what was available at the bar, or cost. Literally no signs. Please have something, as 240 is a large group of people who need directions. Maybe a smaller wedding could have done without. Or have someone announce information. 
* Buffet dinner was good, normal spread of chicken, prime rib, potatoes, salad, and bread rolls. The prime rib had a sauce next to it that didn't have a sign, people were guessing if it was anything from gravy to pudding. Turns out it was a horseraddish sauce. Please have a sign. 
   * Another hiccup - the person responsible for releasing tables for the buffet was late. And then she released us in a strange order. Our table was skipped/missed. We flagged down another worker and he said we should just get in line. Half of our table did, half stayed. The other half tired to join the line a few minutes later and the table-release woman yelled at them to sit back down until released. Once she was far enough away (on the other side of the dance floor) they got up and got in line. We felt bad but every table within 3 rows already had food. We were starving and buzzed. 
* Speeches were lovely, heartfelt, and hilarious. MOH and best man were only bridal party members who gave speeches. MOG and FOB gave quick 30 second thank you speeches. 
* Dances were next - a little delay as the bridal party scattered after speeches. Took a few mins to round them all up again. Dances were cute, the couple sang the song to each other. They laughed and it was very sweet! Father/daughter dance was to the impeial march, it was so cool! 
* They did the dollar dance and then opened up the dance floor for everyone. 
* They did the garter belt, bouquet toss, and something I had never seen before: a literal ball and chain attached to the groom and they auctioned off the key. I don't know if that is a thing, I've never seen it. Maybe a family tradition? 

**Overall:** The wedding was sweet, and you could really tell how excited the bride and groom were to marry each other. My biggest issue was the lack of communication - we didn't know what, where, when anything was. "

I've seen a few posts about men changing their last names, or both people changing their last names, but for heterosexual couples the majority of the time (both on Reddit and in real life) it's still just the woman changing her name after getting married.

Has/did your boyfriend/fiance/husband consider changing his last name? Did he end up doing it, or did he just consider it and ultimately decide not to? Whether it's taking your last name, hyphenating, or combining or making a new last name for for the two of you. Or was he completely opposed to changing his name at all? 

And while it seems like the majority of this sub is female, if any males here want to contribute their reasons for changing or not changing their names, feel free to.

73,Has anyone ever had to ask a bridesmaid to step down?,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfae96a3c8>,agoodnightssleep,0,6,7,False,weddingplanning,,1536111582.0,9d1tk9,"I think I may have to ask one of my bridesmaids to step down, but I’m not sure how to bring it up. It seems like it’ll be the most awkward situation. 

A little back story...this person has been one of my really good friends for the last 10 years, but unfortunately has struggled with alcoholism the last few years. She’s done multiple trips to rehabs and continues to relapse. When I asked her to be a bridesmaid, she had recently gotten out of rehab and actually seemed like she was going to be sober this time around and actually wanted to be. 

Fast forward 3 months later and I set up my first dress appointment. She said she was going to come to the appointment, but never shows up. I text her afterwards and she claims she forgot she had to pick up a family member at the airport. I thought this was a little weird that she wouldn’t have just texted me that she couldn’t make it anymore, but I overlooked it. 

Two weeks later, I schedule 2 more dress appointments on the same day. She was supposedly coming to both, but I didn’t expect much. She texted me right before the first one saying she had a surprise birthday lunch, but would be at the second one. She shows up late to the second appointment and is hammered. Hair and makeup all disheveled, she immediately starts crying to another bridesmaid that her and her boyfriend broke up. Then for the whole appointment, she sat in the corner and didn’t say a word. When we go to leave, I go up to her car and it wreaks of alcohol. I can’t even believe she drove that far in that condition. She can barely even talk to say bye. 

Now I’m at the point where I don’t know if it’s a good idea for her to be a bridesmaid. But how do you ask someone to step down without ruining a friendship? I brought up her being drunk at the appointment and she swore to me it was a one time relapse and she thought she could have a drink for her birthday. I don’t honestly believe this because I know how addicts lie. 

I’m just looking for any advice or if anyone else has had to do this before. Thanks in advance!

TL;DR - one of my bridesmaids is a struggling alcoholic and I think I need to ask her to step down, but don’t know how. "

My brother got married recently and I was sooooo happy for him. I'm getting married soon and it's honestly been really fun getting to know his fiance better and being able to bounce ideas off someone. She's wonderful :) So, this isn't about that.

They are the type of couple that are attached at the hip, always together, always having fun. The hashtag was created for them. My fiance and I are are much more independent. We trust and support each other 100% and we give each other a lot of freedom when it comes to event obligations. (You don't want to go to my cousins party? that's cool, I don't really want to go to your uncles housewarming.)

Anyway, my brother and his fiance just looked SO IN LOVE. Also because they are always together the families are super close. My parents and her parents have become friends. It's just so nice. And you could just feel it in the room. And the wedding was PERFECT.

I just felt myself getting kinda jealous. And a little freaked out that I'm not going to be able to help comparing their wedding to ours. Just need some reassurance on the day of none of this will matter :)"

I do really love that a photo booth would allow us to get more photos of our guests than we're likely to get from just our professional photographers, and I can also see how they can be a fun interactive element of a reception (especially for people who aren't into dancing). But FH and I are both pretty turned off by the standard kitschy photo booth props. They feel played out and those kinds of pictures aren't really our thing. We could maybe come up with a few fun props that suit our wedding vibes (like flower crowns or giant paper flowers since the wedding is at a wildflower center, maybe some paper cutouts of our cats) but we really don't want the usual over-sized glasses, costume hats, and feather boas. Do you think it would be lame to have a photo booth without those props or with a limited selection of not-very-kooky props? Would people still have fun with it? I need some honest opinions!"

They are custom sizes, so they aren't returnable now that we got them and it turns out they are 2"" too big on all the girls. One of my ladies brought her dress to a tailor's (our first plan of attack) and they said it was 4 sizes too big and it would cost over $100 to tailor it down, which is more than we paid for the dress. I'm thinking we'll just have to eat the cost of the three dresses and buy new ones, since tailoring doesn't seem like our best option. Any other ideas? I'm kicking myself for buying them too big, but it was based off other people's reviews and we thought too big was better than too small... Maybe I can sell them somewhere to make back some of the costs? At least this is the first thing that's gone ""wrong"" with our wedding planning so far! \*knock on wood!!\* "
77,Rant: Guest RSVP'd for uninvited child,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb36be400>,weddingthrowaway1000,0,17,10,False,weddingplanning,,1536101191.0,9d0j8f,"A couple who I'm close friends with RSVP'd to my wedding, which is on Sept 22. The deadline to RSVP was Aug 15. On Sunday, they RSVP'd for their young child to attend as well. The invite was addressed to the couple only (Mr. & Mrs. X). We did online RSVPs and I guess I should have disabled that option after the deadline, but it didn't occur to me that anyone would try to do this (I guess lesson learned for anyone reading this). I only noticed it today when I checked my email and saw the reservation notification.

The only children we invited to our wedding are my brother's, because he and his wife are traveling from out of town and have two very young children they don't want to leave behind. (This couple lives in the same town as the wedding, if it matters.) No other guests are bringing children. It will not be a particularly child-friendly event (lots of alcohol and lots of wild dancing is the vibe we're going for). 

I've known this couple for a very long time and they are wonderful people. I'm so shocked that they would do something so rude (or not know that what they did is rude?) and I'm now really upset that I'm going to have to make a super awkward phone call to tell them that their child can't come. I'm worried that this could damage my relationship with these people, but I did not budget or plan for their child to attend. On the other hand, I feel like maybe I'm over-reacting due to wedding stress, because I'm so upset by this and maybe I shouldn't be. 

Am I over-reacting? Has anyone had to handle a similar situation? How did it go? "

Is there a polite way to do this? The last thing I want is for it to feel like a money grab. Perhaps if the invite came from my parents and included something that said ""no gifts""?

Is there a way to do this that might let people know that we can't invite them to the wedding, but it's still important that thy can celebrate with us in any way? I would hate to have to converse with someone asking me when their invite will come when they aren't on the guest list.

They are not contributing financially to anything for the wedding and are in no way hosting this event. They are, however, 100% hosting the rehearsal dinner. Similarly, the rehearsal dinner invitation will only have their names as they are the hosts. Is this correct etiquette? Love my family friend's parent who made this silly comment - she was mother of the groom in a recent wedding, however, contributed 20K to their affair. I understand why this would be different if we were paying for the wedding ourselves, or if both sets of parents were helping, but my parent's are paying for all of it. Thanks for any and all advice!
