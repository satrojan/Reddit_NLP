0,Do you care about this community? Would you like to help us keep it going? Apply to be a mod!,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb67299e8>,RBNmod,0,60,489,False,raisedbynarcissists,Do not PM shared account.  Use the modmail link in the sidebar.,1526642684.0,8kcf8k,"[Heyo RBN!](https://media.giphy.com/media/dzaUX7CAG0Ihi/giphy.gif)

Have you been an active user for a year or so, and would like to help make this sub a better place? We have an opportunity for you! We are looking for some people who would like to be trained to be an RBN mod.  Specifically, we are looking for people who care deeply about this community and the support that it offers and would like to help the team develop it and keep it safe.  We are not looking for folks who just want another badge. 

You can spend as much time as you like helping keep this community safe for abuse survivors.  If you have 20 minutes a day, that's a huge help!  If you have 2 hours a day, that's great, too!  It's all up to you!

As this is a huge subreddit, we understand that jumping right in can be stressful. That is why we are looking for people who would like to (start out or) be mini-mods. What’s a mini-mod, you may ask? Well, we are looking for mini-mods to do one or both of the following:

**Flair Control** - As a flair mod, your sole responsibility would be to go through our unmodded links, and confirm or apply the proper flairs according to guidelines. We have automoderator tag according to key words, but as it’s a robot that can’t understand context, it’s not always right. Many people do not apply flairs or do not know how to apply flairs as well (which is absolutely fine!) as this mod would help with that.

**Auto-Mod Queue** - as a queue mod, you would go through our queue and deal with only the items reported by our automoderator. The automoderator will report items based on key words, to confirm context or to alert us to possible drama or someone who needs extra support. As far as user reports go, you will not be responsible for this, as we will handle this.

Mini-mods are not given full mod permissions immediately, as with most jobs there is a probationary period to ensure that the new team member is an appropriate fit for the sub (acts appropriately, follows the mod rules/guidelines, etc.). Generally training takes one to two months for mini-mods but that depends on the individual, the time they can commit to the volunteer position, how much material is covered and how the senior mods feel about the trainee's progress.

If you'd like to be promoted to a full-mod eventually, that is something you can work towards.  If you would like to stay a mini-mod, that is just fine, too!  It's up to you.  

However, there is one bit that is no longer optional.  **Availability on Discord for text chat only (never video) is required.**  It doesn't mean that you must be on Discord all day or that you must answer any message to you on Discord instantly.  It just means that you should be able to check in with Discord periodically (at least a few times a week) to get updates from the other mods about what is going on and for training assignments, etc.  

I also want to be honest about what this job entails.  It is reading a lot of triggering content.  It is seeing the truly dark side of RBN that our general members never get to see, because we try to remove all that B.S. before our members have to read that nonsense.  It can take an emotional toll, but it is also rewarding.  The thank you notes that we occasionally get from members are nice.  The posts that thank the mods because the group saved their life... those are nice, too.  

If modding sounds like a good job for you, fill out the form linked below and it will be reviewed ASAP! Successful applicants will be contacted by a mod of /r/raisedbynarcissists some time in the future (sorry, no time line available at this point).

He seemed as an enabler whole his life (to a quite agressive nmother) but it recent years, he comes out as a true narc himself. 

He told me he cut out my older sister (married, had children, once she left to another country. Since then, and bcs of that, ""she betrayed them"".  she's a great daughter, very successful and nice human being. Many parents would adore having a child like that). She is also VVVLC with them. If she hadn't done that, believe me she could have never live her life as she intended to. 

I asked him how can he say that for his daughter. It's not normal (although actually it was my sister who cut them off, after giving them a million opportunities to behave as decent parents). His answer - I cut her out, bcs she doesn't call (before that, I was a great father to her, he denies every mistreatment or emotional abuse). 

And he asks me why do you care. 
I say, bcs I am also your daughter and it hurts. It hurts my brother too.  Will you cut out us too (when we decide to live our lifes, differently from what you think we should) and stay alone? 

Yes, I will cut you out, all of you. No problem. 

After that I told him not to call me ever again. 
It just came out of my mouth, as a reaction.

3,[RANT] NMom and NSis showed up to my home after I went NC with them,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb5c65438>,sexyhappyunicorn,0,180,1957,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536075650.0,9cwre1,"Yesterday I hosted the family Labor Day celebration at my home. 


Usually it’s at my parent’s house but my NMom and Dad are separated so no one wanted to go to their house. My NMom and NSis live there and my Dad is staying with me until their divorce is finalized.


For the first time in a long time all of my local family showed up. Most of them refuse to come to family events (except funerals) because they don’t want to deal with my NMom. 



We were having a great time. Everything was stress free. 



Then my NMom and NSis walk in the gate to my backyard. My heart sank immediately.



Everyone goes silent. A few of my relatives run inside the house because they didn’t want to deal with her or NSis. My Aunt who records all family events turns the camera to them.



My NMom yells at me about how inconsiderate it was to exclude them, how much I must really hate her and my NSis, how jealous of them I am,  how she hates coming to my house because it’s always so “sterile” and she’s afraid to touch anything or sit anywhere. 



I cut her off at that point and tell her neither of them are welcome and they need to go before I call the police (my Dad has a restraining order against my NMom). They head to the gate but not before she had to get the final word. 



**She tells me she read the e-mail I sent to her about cutting off all contact. She says “I’m offended by you and how you say I’ve treated you. All I’ve ever done is try to love you and you’re unlovable. How is that my fault? He’s (she pointed to my Dad) unlovable too. My online therapist says you’re both social rapists and terrible people!”**



I shrugged my shoulders and responded “of course we are. Nothing is ever your fault. I abused myself all those years. And if you truly feel that way about us then leave and never come back here. I don’t want you to feel socially raped.”



**Her response was “I had to come since you changed all your phone numbers, I can’t reach you at work, your Dad got that restraining order on me and any e-mails I send to you come back with a message that you’re not taking my e-mails and not to contact you. I knew you’d be here so I came to tell you and him (she pointed at my Dad) I’m done with you both. If you two don’t want me to contact you anymore then I won’t. Let’s see how good your life is without me. You’re not welcome at my house ever again. I don’t need either of you.”**



I tell her “I’m good with that. Have a nice life.”



When they’re almost at the car my NSis comes back and yells to my Dad “you’ll never see your grandkids again.” My father points to my NSis’ ex-husband who says “they’re here with me. They’re inside the house playing video games. He’ll see them plenty.”



My NSis kicks over 2 of my potted cactus plants, gets scratched by the needles then tripped by the first pot she kicked over. She gets up then runs to the car crying.



We all  try not to laugh since it was so comically dramatic but it was very hard not to so we laughed.




I hope I don’t see or hear from either of them anytime soon. I still feel good about going NC with both of them. Best decision I’ve made ever. 



**Thanks to everyone on here who sent me encouraging PMs after going NC with them. The positive support has been overwhelmingly awesome. There’s comfort knowing that I’m not alone and I can help others not feel so alone since we’re all going through the same things.**"

I only wish I could have seen the look on her face when she read the titles and realized they were all about her. I only have one mom, there’s no delusion she could have invented to save herself from the realization that I’m on to her and taking back control
over my own life. This was several years ago, of course she’s never mentioned it since and I’d totally forgotten about it until I found the books. Good times. She still fucking opens my mail sometimes, but hasn’t opened one of my packages since. "
6,Are any of you fans of Bojack Horseman?,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfaf5b0550>,pastelwings,0,30,165,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536111458.0,9d1t0i,"This is a Netflix original show and I think it's not just my favorite cartoon, but my favorite show, period. But fuck, sometimes its hard to watch. It portrays mental illness so well, and the cycle of abuse passed on from parents to children. Bojack's mother is definitely a NMom and Bojack is a N who wants to be better but can't seem to escape his own bad thoughts and habits. Watching this show has opened my eyes up to a lot of things about myself I hadn't realized, and actually made me think about people differently. 

For those of you who are fans, what did you think of the arc with Bojack and Beatrice in season 4?"
7,Awkward car ride to the airport.... IM NOT CRAZY!,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb3ebb6a0>,BlueGreenandPink,0,10,23,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536150007.0,9d5z4j,"I feel like my world has been turned upside down and my eyes have seen things in a new light....

This morning as Nmom was driving me to the airport, there was complete awkward silence. No talking. Nothing.  (She’s upset that I’m leaving for a week/bought a plane ticket to visit family 2 states away, but I didn’t want to spend $1200+ on a new bed). I spent the first 10 minutes questioning myself.... what did I do wrong? Why is she mad at me? Why do I always make things like this? Why am I the way I am? I pondered with thoughts like these for about 10 minutes... and then it hit me... I DID NOTHING!

I am not a bad person for taking a trip to visit family. I’m not the one that makes the relationship awkward. *I’m not crazy!* I didn’t do anything. It’s not my responsibility to take blame for EVERYTHING to try and make sense of Nmoms blaming. I’m not the cause of the maladaptive emotions. 

A weight lifted from me at that moment. I no longer have to continue taking the blame for things that I am not to blame for! I am not in control of others emotions or reactions. 

Does anyone else feel like THEY’RE crazy??? I feel like I’ve been locked in an insane asylum for years only to JUST discover that I’m not crazy and I don’t belong in an asylum.... and I never did!! 

But it’s hard to strip yourself of a title (crazy/overemotional/bad person) that you’ve been associated with for so long. 

I can’t wait for this to get easier. "
8,I've been researching dysfunctional family characteristics and just...ugh,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb6b2ecf8>,throwawaybayleef,0,14,32,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536142260.0,9d522s,"As the title explains, I've been researching dysfuntionals families, mostly the roles within them.

This is mostly because, in another post, somebody told me my little sister was what you call a ""lost child"" and I wanted to look into it more.

I'm actually really uncomfortable with what I discovered.

I hate to be ""that person"" but I'm actually crying right now.

Because of something I read on the internet.

Wow I feel pathetic.

First I was reading up on the Lost Child, the websites I was looking at made it seem like the only reason the Lost Child is neglected as opposed to physically abused is because they're sweet and smol and quiet and just...stay out of drama.

That's right kiddos, remember all those times you were struggling to hold back tears and kept asking yourself why your parents can't just leave you the fuck alone when you try so hard to stay off their radar? Obviously you just weren't trying hard enough to stay out of the drama.

Now, I figured that maybe they weren't actually saying that the reason Lost Children don't get physically abused is because they ""avoid drama"" as opposed to the fact they are just lucky enough to not matter to their abusive parents and perhaps I perceived it wrong, perhaps due to being oversensitive about this issue.

I made the mistake on reading about Scapegoats.

Oh wow,

According to some research us Scapegoats are ""often mean"" and we often bring our problems(ie: abuse) on ourselves because we're just that, mean, defiant, angry. In fact, most of what I've been looking at says that scapegoats ""choose their role in the family""

:')

Lmao k

I don't know how often I tried to fly under nmoms radar but couldn't. When I didn't mess up she would just invent things to be mad about. I didn't choose to be abused, and my attempts to be a good little Lost Child and avoid drama didn't work.

I brung nothing on myself.

To say that I did implies that I deserved it, or that I could have easily not been abused if I just took a few moments to be a smol bean who avoids annoying nmom and I could have gotten neglected instead (which would have also been garbage as well, I'm not trying to pretend being a Lost Child is all sunshines and rainbows, just that it was what I really wanted when I was growing up)

&#x200B;

Yes when I was 4 years old getting beat mercilessly for some perceived slight against nmom it was because I chose that lifestyle for myself. You see, I was just a mean little defiant angry turd who actively chose to be abused by my mom because I was a glutton for negative attention. 

And when I was 7 and my mom trashed my room before insulting me, only to later justify her actions as ""being mad at all of you kids"" I was singled out because I wanted to be, and my siblings didn't.

Or how about when I was 10 and my mom put her cigarette out of me for the first, but not the last, time. I was just goading her with my thirst for negative attention. If I could just try and stay out of her way and avoid conflict it would all be good.

I was a good kid,

I did amazing academically, was top-of-the-class for almost everything.

When I was home I'd just hide out in my room whenever I wasn't doing chores.

I would try and avoid my nmoms foul moods, but it was always to no avail because I'd end up getting dragged out of bed at night and getting beat. For no reason. For whatever reason Godwin invented.

And did ya'll know how us Scapegoat's are supposed to heal from our childhood abuse?

Well, according to one article I read, Scapegoat's will be fine once we finally learn to be good people.

Does that enrage anyone else, or just me?

It's the golden children who need the real help.

Witnessing their sibling being abused, and sometimes taking part in perpetrating that abuse, according to these articles is actually more damaging than being abused.

I'm so sorry to my siblings who abused me, if I'd known it hurt them more than it hurt me I'd have just...been a good little girl and not drawn attention to myself like I'm supposed to right? Because if I was good I wouldn't have been abused right? According to research, yes.

A part of me seriously hopes I just came across some bogas articles, but I don't know.

They were right about some things.

Most of my adult relationships are shallow and inauthentic.

I am self-destructive.

One of my GC brothers is an emotional husband and is an overacheiver.

My edad does seem to think that something horrible will happen if he stops enabling nmom, but he's in no way sympathetic like all these articles harp on about.

Oh, I don't know.

I managed to find some articles that contradict the concept of ""being a scapegoat is like, totally your own choice man"" but I don't know.

Maybe they're right. Maybe all my trauma would ""go away"" if I was a ""nice person""

Maybe abuse doesn't leave scars, and my unhappiness is due to my own personal faults.

It seems incredibly narcissistic and arrogant to ignore the articles that paint scapegoats in a negative light and challenge my perception of my families dynamic.

But, it just seems so wrong and untrue.

I don't know.

I just don't know.

9,To the narcissist who will never apologize to me.,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb8704940>,theimmigrantcheetah,0,7,58,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536124136.0,9d39xm," I have accepted in my own way, over these past few months, that I will never receive a genuine apology from you. I'll tell you, it has been a hard truth to face. What happened between us is one of the most painful things to have ever happened to me. Some days, I still sit in the shock of it all. The disturbing truth of who you turned out to be was something that literally made me physically ill and something that is still so hard for me to comprehend.

The day I realized that I will never hear a true apology from you, I gained valuable knowledge and the ability to find closure within myself and not you. I will not spend the rest of my life waiting for that apology. I refuse to give another piece of my life to you. What is helpful to me is knowing and accepting that you are just one of those people, and I am not.

One of those people who hurts others deeply, and is so ashamed by your own actions, you can never truly own up to them. Because to do so would be an attack against your ego, your self-esteem, and your self-worth the way YOU see it and feel it. To do so, would mean more self-loathing for you and more demons within to fight. Admitting you were wrong is an attack against yourself, and you already so fragile and weak. You are already to the point of trying to destroy other people like you have destroyed yourself.

I will not demand an apology from you any longer, or that you fix the situation. I won't confront you with your despicable actions any longer. I already know you will have a painful life with the path you are headed on. I won't seek to hurt you back. Karma is real, but it's not my job to see that it gets served. It's not my job to force apologies out of you, to force you to do your own internal work that needs to be done.

I will never be the person who gets you to see your mistakes and make changes. The only person who could ever do that is you.

Thank you for the 5 years of friendship. 5 years of hard lessons and painful truth. It's over now, and in letting go of the apology that will never happen, I have regained my life.

A life spent waiting in that dark place for your apology is a life wasted away.

Goodbye."

My Nfather is 55 and is a high school drop out. My Nmother is 59 and dropped out of college and hasn't had a job since the late 70's. Throughout my life they pushed me to go to college and get a degree because they said it was the key to success, but they really had no idea what any of it meant. Their highest aspirations for me were for me to go to community college maybe.

So basically I had 0 guidance in life on where to go. My parents were no help, they have no idea how the world works and make no effort to learn. I went through school and got a degree in CS. My first job was working help desk for $6 dollars an hour (I'm 34 so this was in the mid 2000's). I made less with a college a degree than without one stacking boxes at a grocery store.

But I fought and was driven to climb the corporate ladder. I self taught myself countless things, gained experienced, and then moved from job to job to gain more money. It took me 7 companies and well over a decade, but I finally became successful. I worked my ass off and now I make 6 figures working in my living room in a city I used to vacation in. I'm happily married to my wonderful wife and we have a great life 5 states away from the city I grew up in.

My parents should be proud of me right? Wrong. They call my wife and I ""snobs"". They guilt trip me for moving away all the time (they want me to live in their shit hole neighborhood with them). They give us backhanded remarks in a condescending tone like ""you're so fancy"" and ""you're riccchhhhh"". They don't even know what I do for a living or what my company's name is called. When they visit me they tell me ""I live in a bubble"" and other bizarre shit. I even caught my Nmother talking shit about me to my aunt because she accidentally dialed my number and left the disturbing shit on my voicemail.

Worst of all is that talk about my brother's job and how great he is constantly. He's 30 and lives at home and he's a janitor. They go on and on about how good his job is and how successful he is. They do this because they can control him because and thus he's the ""golden child"". Never mind the fact that he put a gun to my father's face and said he was going to kill him. They didn't press charges of course. After all this he is held in a higher regard than myself while they resent me for not being in their stable to mental illness.

They can resent me all they want, the best revenge is a life well lived."

I am just so baffled that my Nmum and Edad were that neglectful. Only towards me.

I should have been taken too a doctor. Even once for a checkup. 

Part of me strongly believes my Nmum allowed all of it to happen. I barely ate due to being always upset. My Nmum enjoyed it. She bragged. Shes always been obsessed with my body. Which makes me think she knew i was not okay. But let it keep going because she got to talk about it and get attention.

I have no fingernails because of my anxiety like I have bitten them down so far it’s insane. I’ve become afraid to express my opinions mostly all the time due to my parents bullshit. They knew I was depressed all this time and didn’t care Like I’d literally sleep all day and wake up just to go back to sleep. I never had a normal childhood and now I can’t get it back. I never went to school because I was homeschooled and now I’m just an abnormal person overall but especially socially. Like my life was really over before it began. Nothing about me is normal and it never will be like I can’t even be a normal kid again I just wish i was never born then I wouldn’t have ever dealt with this.

Now Jim is just the guy that Mom and I take care of. 

I'm currently reading the story of Regina Calcaterra and the severely harsh upbringing she endured with her sisters and brother. In the book, ""Etched in Sand"" (and her sister Rosie's book, ""Girl Unbroken""), they called their mother ""Cookie"" because she was their mother in blood, but not in any other sense of the term. 

Now, I'd never say my upbringing was anywhere close to what those siblings went through, and I feel guilt even adapting this emotional tool from them, but in the passed two days I've mentally changed the way I think of my father from ""Dad"" to ""Jim"" has actually worked wonders. 

No more rabbit-hole thinking for me of, ""Dad's mad, what did I do? I just got home, I thought I did everything right today, why is he taking it out on me? Why is it always like this? Why does he hate me so much? My chest is tightening already - I hop he doesn't pick up on that, then he'll really go off."" 

Now it's just, ""Jim's silently fuming at us? That's just Jim for you. Jim's got issues that I can't help or fix. Whatever. I have some laundry to fold."" 

Has anyone else adapted this? "

At first I got all excited because of course I love them and when dad text me to share an annecdote about his life I felt really happy and I missed them both and wanted to feel closer to them. 

But... when they do this, it usually means they either have bad news about someone I love or they've just given my sibling a massive present and they're messaging me to try and either let me know so I'll be hurt or maybe just to assuage their subconscious guilt. 

Anyway, following day I get mega love bombed, fished for information (they're on a pretty severe information diet) and get my spouse casually insulted by mum. Then I find out they've just bought my sibling (who they've been bank rolling at about $60,000 a year to study and not work - she's in her 30's and this is her third different qualification) a holiday to the west coast of America with her best friend because she got good grades. 

So I got proved right. Then I cried because I was right. 

Then I gaslit myself for the next three days that I'm being irrational and somehow this is all something wrong with my perception of the situation and that they're great. Thats still going on. I guess I still just want to be loved so much. Ugh.

Anyway, he told me why he was annoyed with me.  He had every right to those feelings and 
I wish i could say I handled it well but I didnt.  I started thinkjng about what I do for him and everyone else and basically went into poor me vicitim mode / hulk smash mode. 

This escalated the conflict and there were some hurtful things said. 

So, I came here to vent about him how he is so dismissive of my needs related to my ADHD and I ended up reading someone elses post here that made me realise I was acting just like my malignant NParent and my histronic NParent.  So I apologized to husband for my overreaction and way I handled his critisism.

22,Got fooled into thinking I could savor a few last memories with my Nmom. I just told her to go fuck herself for the last time and I won't even visit her when she's on her deathbed (she'd still be playing the victim anyway),<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb6115a90>,arcanine911,0,15,138,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536078049.0,9cx5ho,"When my dad died a year ago, I tried to reconnect with my Nmom.  Fucking stupid, I know.  I've long accepted that she would never change and I wasn't trying to change her.  For some bizarre reason, I thought I could create some last happy memories with her as I was on the verge of becoming one of those people who loses both their parents when I'm only in my 20's.

I have this flaw where I try to see the good in people, and I have no idea where I developed this characteristic.  Maybe it was from the negative environment I grew up in?  Because of this I've been taken advantage of numerous times, and I'm telling you all now that I am DONE falling for this shit.  Some people are just plain fucking evil.

There were signs over the past year that she was hiding some shit, but I chose to ignore them as I didn't live there anymore and honestly, I didn't WANT to believe them.  She sold my brother's bike and pawned my grandmother's ring.  She and my enabling sister went to the social security office the day after my dad died to try siphoning money, and then had a wake for him without ever inviting me.

I knew it was money.  But I chose to ignore it and accept her vices.

Every Saturday she would call me and ask to hang out and we would; sometimes it would just be lunch and dinner, or sometimes we would take walks in the park and talk.  Sometimes she would laugh and actually listen to my stories and I knew deep down they were fake because all she wanted to know was if my brother had deposited money into my account to give to her.  If my brother HAD deposited money, she would hang out with me longer.  Otherwise, she would find excuses to leave such as claiming she was tired or had a dinner with a friend to attend.

Anyway, I should mention the most important part of all of this: my cousin ""John"".  John moved up here from SoCal over a year and a half ago to attend UC Berkeley and somehow he ended up living with my mom.  I do not know if he asked her to stay here or if it was the other way around.  

My mom and sister (yes, we talked again for a few weeks before I blocked her number completely because she was still a compulsive lying junkie) would constantly bitch to me about how lazy John was, how he refused to pay rent and get a part-time job, and how he would sleep in until noon on his days off.  As I said, I didn't fucking care as I didn't live there anymore.

But shit started affecting me as my mom would leave messages for me whining about how she needed groceries and had no food and other shit.  Since I wasn't giving money to her directly, it didn't bother me the first few times I drove across the city after an 8 hour fucking work shift just to deliver some water and random produce.  Finally I asked my mom why the fuck she wouldn't ask John to just walk across the street to help buy them shit and did she know how ridiculous it was that she was asking me to do this shit?  My mom isn't exactly disabled herself either.  We all live in a VERY large city where there are grocery stores and liquor stores mottled across every other block.  

My moms excuse was that it would be rude to ask John and that he was graduating in another year and to just tolerate it.

My brother and I have gotten along in life more than anyone else in the family and he told me he had a theory that my mom and sister was lying about John's antics.  She had done the **exact same thing** to me and my siblings to other people, all for the purpose of free money.  I decided to test out his theory.

I sent a text to John and asked if he could ""please try helping out more with groceries"" -- never once did I act accusatory or ask suspicious questions.  He immediately called me and said there was A LOT of misinformation about everything and he wanted to come clean about it.

1) On the second day he had moved in, my sister had told John to pretend he wasn't paying rent so that my brother and I wouldn't stop supporting my mom financially.  She told him not to trust anything I said and that I was ""crazy"".

2) John HAD been paying rent since the day he moved in.  He sent me picture messages of all the bank transactions linking the transfers directly to my mother's name.  

3) John also sent me picture messages of the texts my sister had sent him warning him not to speak to me, of her asking him for money, and bragging about how much ""she was ballin"".  These were antics my sister were well known for, so there was no way he could have just photoshopped them.

4) John had concerns about how my mom runs out of money quickly every month.  Apparently she was still disappearing for days at the casinos.  Additionally, John WAS bringing groceries him and taking my mom out to eat every other day; he had photos of them at restaurants with that fakeass witch smiling as I could see she was taking advantage of my own cousin..  All of this contradicted my moms whiny stories about how John never helped her ass out.

There was so much proof and information provided to me that I made *the final decision*: I was going to confront my mother and depending on how she reacted, I would cut her out of my life entirely.  Forever.

She picked up the phone and claimed she had told me everything John stated above and immediately became aggressive until finally telling me to ""just go kill myself"".  Yep, that was the proof I needed - my mother always acted like the victim when she was caught lying and playing people.  

I immediately called AT&T and cut off the cell phone bill I had been paying for her.  With all the money she's obtained from lying and stealing, I'm quite sure she's more than capable of paying her own bill.

I cancelled her name on the trip to NYC we were planning to take together later this month and instead worked it out with my husband to have him come instead.  NYC has always been my dream city to visit and I would rather go with the love of my life than a lying piece of shit.  The fees were nothing compared to saving my mental health.

Anyway, sorry for the long post but I wanted to let you all know that I have been much happier the past few days knowing I will never be in contact with this woman again.  Btw, on the same day I confronted her, she claimed she was having side pains and needed to go to the ER.  Magically, she called me from her house phone a few hours after I had disconnected her cell phone to try leaving me an angry voice message that I didn't even bother listening to.

We are all stronger than we think, and sadly sometimes we need we need a reminder to push ourselves to best capabilities but I am glad more than anything that I never gave up."
23,I can't believe nmom sold it...,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb402f1d0>,lucid_shad0w,0,58,155,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536072943.0,9cwcjs,"...Wait, yes I can, but I'm still mad.

When I was a kid, I was super into collecting Breyer horses (realistic model horses).  Knowing this, my grandfather offer to build me a custom barn to house them in.  He did an amazing job and presented it to me at Christmas.  It was awesome and got a ton of use.

Fast forward: As I'm moving out at 22, I took my Breyer horses with me but left the barn as it was large and my apartment was small.  Nmom at the time was storing all of my old toys in hopes that a grandchild would be able to play with them.  Nparents had a basement and even when I bought my first house it was in North Carolina and had no basement.  Believing that nmom was keeping all of my old toys, I didn't think much of it.

Fast forward some more: We move back up to Ohio so my daughter can be closer to all of her family.  Nmom start slowly giving out my old toys to her (of course, it's a little bit at a time as an ""excuse"" to see my daughter).  Last night, nmom gives my daughter all of the Breyer horse accessories then casually mentions that she had gotten rid of the barn because it was too big.  I sat that flabbergasted because that literally was the only thing I cared about, and she didn't keep it (i.e. she sold it, and pocketed the money).

I'm still upset today.  I know it's just a thing, but it was the nicest thing my grandfather every gave me (he died in early 2013) and I was looking forward to seeing my daughter play with it.  If she would have said something that she didn't want to store it anymore, I would have gladly taken it off of her hands.  Rather, I'm assuming that she just wanted the money.  If I would have known this was going to happen, It would have been the first thing I'd have taken with me when I first moved out.  The hubby convinced me to email her about it, since it's apparently upsetting me this much.  We'll see how that goes...

Edit: Thanks guys for the responses and thanks for letting me vent for a bit (which was what I needed).  Like I said, it is just a thing, and I still have the memories of playing with it.  I overall feel better and am letting this one go.  I wish I would have taken it with me when I first moved out, but I had no idea what narcissists were at the time and the big blow-ups hadn't started yet either (those came later when I started having opinions of my own and I stopped kissing their butts so much).  By the time I knew what they were, I'm sure it was gone.  That being said, it's time to move on.  I can remember my grandpa in other ways.  Like some of you have suggested, I'm going to see about making a new one, possibly with my FIL helping (who is the nicest most wonderful person). That will give it special meaning for my daughter.  As for nmom in the mean-time, she's mad that I (finally) voiced my emotions, so maybe I'll get a break from her for a bit.  


Also, whole issue came right after this ([https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/9c5f24/nparents\_apparently\_trespassed\_into\_my\_house\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/9c5f24/nparents_apparently_trespassed_into_my_house_this/)) happened, so I'm still reeling from that. I spent a good deal of my adult life 500 miles away from them.  Now, that they are closer, I'm just going to have to do a better job at keeping up my guard."

I’m a long-time lurker, first time poster. I’m 17, moved out of my mom’s house about five months ago, and have been living with my dad. I left really suddenly because I was afraid of things escalating to physical violence, and I haven’t been in contact with her since (except for once, when she claimed I was making everything up, and told me I was even lying about being scared of her) . Until today, when she showed up at my school on the first day of the new school year, and demanded we go somewhere to talk.

I said no, to which she replied that she’d keep coming to my school every day during lunch and sitting next to me the whole time. Apparently she wants us to go out to lunch together once a week so she can show me pictures of from my childhood and talk about what I was like as a kid, covering a year each time we meet. I don’t know why she wants to do this, but the last thing I want is to be alone with her, even if it’s just in a car. I’d also strongly prefer she not show up at my school for an hour every day, though. I can’t do anything legally, because my parents still technically have shared custody, and my dad doesn’t want any sort of legal battle. She’s also charming, so the school staff doesn’t have a problem with her being there, and they don’t know what she’s saying to me most of the time as she talks to me in a second language we both speak. Unfortunately, my school is also pretty small, so physically hiding would be hard.

Is there something I could do to make her get bored/just wear herself out and leave? If not, what’s my best bet as to dealing with this?

UPDATE: I talked to my principal and he said he’d prefer the school not get too involved in family stuff and it’s not *illegal* for my mom to be here, but that it isn’t appropriate and he’ll try and talk to her about it, so we’ll see how this goes"

Recently I miscarried and needed to get various tests done to confirm and that there wasn't any additional problems. The Dr phoned me this morning and luckily there wasn't any additional problems

When I turned 18 I went to my local health clinic and asked them to remove me from my parents account (in this country you're part of your parents ""medical insurance account"" including text updates and one website account until you ask to be removed). Somehow they made a mistake and didn't remove me from the account and I had no idea since I don't need to go the drs very often. 

So this afternoon my nmum gets a text saying *my name* results have arrived ..... She phones me and tells I got my tests results and started demanding I tell her what the tests were. I start telling her that it doesn't matter because im fine (she didn't know because it was still in early pregnancy). She kept insisting that she's my mother and that I have to tell her, I responded that she doesn't need to concern (pppfff concern....) herself because there's nothing wrong with me... she kept going and I eventually lost it and shouted at her that it's none of her business because im am adult and she can't force me and try to manipulate me into telling her. Her response was all too perfect: ""one day you will treat me like your mother and you will tell me""  I told her ok mum and hung up.

For the last two hours I've been frantically calling number after number to once again separate my account from my parents. I've so far managed to disconnect the phone number but I haven't yet been able to do the same for the website which is more problematic because only she knows the password (whether she's aware of that I don't know).

My old job had offered me an opportunity out of state, and naturally, I jumped at the chance to travel and get away from the N’s. [However, they wasted no time in shitting all over my new job.](https://ibb.co/bvy19e)

That lovely email of congratulations was from my alcoholic N/Edad. I’ve posted about Nmom in JNM. All they did was make me keep them in the loop and then shit all over everything. Even if they made valid points, my goal was to get away from them. It’s so bad that I was willing to risk whatever my sperm donor addressed in that email. Even when my friends agreed with it.

I get to the job, and wrongly assume that it’s as lax as they were here. I could walk in after 2 hours like “lolz I forgot” and theyd be like “k cool”. Not that I did it here. Just on a couple of occasions that I was too depressed to get out of bed. And I also casually mentioned that my parents were crazy N’s. 

I’m maybe 1-2 weeks in when one of the other project managers sends out a blast email stating that there was bad feedback on me. Something that wasn’t addressed with me prior. It felt like an ambush. The “I have crazy nparents” comment apparently constituted “oversharing inappropriate personal details.” 

If you guys want “inappropriate personal details,” I’ll gladly go into graphic detail about my sex life, and how I hate Jenny. I said nothing along those lines. So I get a talking to about it, and seemed to be humored when I protested that nobody ever addressed anything with me ever. This job had me crying on the way there, the drive back to the company paid apartment, where I was roommates with the girl who sent the email, and in my own apartment.

I eventually confronted the girl who sent the email/my former roommate. She was fake when she said she thought I already spoke to our regional manager about it. And she would constantly tell me that “so and so doesn’t like your work hehe.” I AM FUCKING TRYING.

Despite all this, I begged to stay. I tried to improve. I was willing to take this over returning to the N’s. But was unfairly terminated. It’s easy enough to say that that email and lack of support from the N’s messed up my psyche. That I was trying, and willing to improve. But I will be accused of shifting the blame no matter what. 

I could have worked on not being late. I could have sought a therapist in that state even if I was only gone a month. I was already trying to learn a new computer system to document, which they unfairly expected me to know in a matter of days. Something which was so unforgivable. Glassdoor reviews on the company address these issues too. 

I gave them a piece of my mind on an exit survey. I was never heard out, always treated unfairly, and scapegoated. While my roommate was the GC of the company. Yet I still wanted to stay, and not go back to the N’s. The 4 month period of unemployment that followed haunts me, and I’m currently in another job in unhappy with.

It’s funny because he told me I’m selfish, disrespectful, only care for myself, and have no goals. Sounds like him. Honestly he can go to hell. 

There’s a difference between doing chores and being a maid/servant/slave. No respect! Nothing for me! And if he says anything he tells me he feeds me. But that’s the bare minimum. He never paid for shit other than food. Mom did everything else.

 When my sister and I started school our friends sometimes came over and wanted to play. We needed to ask first and they often said ""we don't have time, room or I'm cleaning. "" but outside was most times ok.

when I had a friend over we played outside with my game boy. Later my grandmother told me to come in because  because it's getting cold. So we booth go to the door and at that moment my grandmother said ""say goodbye to FRIEND"" I thought we would play inside :( later she complained to my mom ""have you seen this? He already wanted to come in!""
 another time when a friend was actually visiting me she said she's hungry and when the food is ready. I didn't know she will stay that long and will eat with us but I asked my mom. She got angry and said it's not ready, here have a orange! Later when she was gone my mother grumbled at me how illmannered ect. My friend is.. 

When classmates showed up spontaneous (my mom wanted to make window pictures with us) she let them also craft. but when they where gone, we realized that a colour was missing... she complained about how she hates it to watch about others people kids.

another time I was invited to a sleepover party. I was not allowed because they ""forgot"" about it and my big sister (we where at 7th grade or so) would be alone at home. I had to call my classmate who made the party at the day the party was that I couldn't come.  1 month later my sister was on a sleepover and *I* was alone at home...well my sister has a lot of friends..
But I wasn't allowed to complain.
The last time I made a attempt of starting a friendship was 2010...they also complained about how stupid my new friend is...

 yeah after a lot of such stories I stopped to make friends. I grow up in the thought it's something bad and I even made excuses when someone invite me. 

But I ""only"" have 2 close friends that I know since 11/12 years and I won't let anyone destroy my friendship with them! My parents complained about them but I don't listen. 

FUN FACT my parents complained why I don't have friends and do stuff...

Now I'm really bad at talking to people. I'm not very interesting since I don't go out (yes I'm 24 and never went clubbing or so, no I don't even want anymore) and have nothing to talk. So when they start asking me things I get stressed and start talking stupid shit.."

I cannot use my phone anywhere. my mom said i could be slowly dying and she wouldn't give it to me to call 911

I cannot watch TV of any kind or Youtube

I cannot use the computer at all. This even applies to studying for god's sake

I cannot leave the house except for school/job

I cannot have sugary foods/drinks

I cannot listen to music.

I cannot play video games.

I cannot message friends.

I cannot interact with my younger sibling if it means entertainment.

I cannot go outside.

I cannot complain or speak for myself unless asked.

I can only take one shower per day, and it can only be five mins. (i often take long showers to calm myself/escape my problems)

I refuse to refer to my parents as ""narcissistic"" but this is way over the line. I will admit video games primarily have been distracting me, but this is way too overboard. This applies to over the weekend was well. I refuse to call myself depressed, but i've attempted two on multiple occasions (two of recently) and i'm trying to get the balls to do it. The thing is, I feel they'll barely even revoke these rules if i ever do bring my grades up, especially the way they talk about it.

33,Do you flinch?,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfaecaa208>,TiengAnh,0,34,89,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536078232.0,9cx6hc,"Something posted by another person on this subreddit got me thinking. When I hear people raising their voices, I instantly freeze and assume it's because of something I've done to make them angry. When someone touches me unexpectedly, I instantly flinch away, thinking they're going to hurt me (even though I was not physically abused when I was younger). When someone gets irritated with me, I instantly become so apologetic that it can be pathetic.

Does this ring any bells for you? Do you know how to managed these seemingly automatic responses to normal behaviours?

34,Why does he always pick on me?,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb1e83518>,abigailjade,0,1,2,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536151490.0,9d66by,"I try be nice, be an adult but hes always got to pick on someone or complain. 

If its not me its my brother or someone else. 
He talks over me, talks down to me, tells me to grow up and the abuse wasn't that bad (yet police and social services are still involved with my youngest brother) 
I recently lost my job and i was a nervous wreck at work, i made huge mistakes and was too scared to ask for help incase i got shouted at or talked down too. 
So i got depressed, ended up signing off and i couldnt even explain to my employer the real reason. So i got sacked.

Its given him more reason to pick on me, he says i bet everyone at work hated you and wanted you gone. Yet people at work seen him shouting at me like a child and said hes a horrible man.

He gives me no privacy and has come into my bedroom twice whilst I've been naked and told me nobody wants to look at me anyway dont worry. 
Hes insulted everything about me and controls me to the point i dread coming home.

He locks the fridge, he locks his bedroom, locks cabinets, doesnt let me use the house phone, wont let me do anything myself and questions me if im going out. 
He called me a whore last weekend for going around to my friends house at 9pm for drinks. Every conversation dominates around him...his past time in the hospital when he was a technician. He wont let me talk and if i do im told im stupid or to grow up. 


Im 23 and tbh im ashmamed i still live at home, my income isnt enough (im trying to find work), i depend on him for food and a roof over my head. 
Hes opened my letters, intervened in my medical treatment, threatened me, hit me over the head and mulitiple times he has told me i deserve to be hit, someone needs too.

My ex came into my house once and asked why i take it from an old man. He barged into my bedroom when me and my ex were sitting on my bed and gritted his teeth at me. Nobody can understand what its like living under this roof and arguing with him. 

He done the same thing to my brother, threatened him and controlled his life.
He stopped me joing the military at 16 and forced me into college because he didnt trust me to have a job.


Sometimes he can be so nice, he brought me a rabbit once, offers me lifts and says he just wants me to find a nice man and settle down (but each time i do he accuses them of being drug dealers or after sex) he accused my friend of being a prostitute because shes Lithuanian. 


I have been in touch with supported living but its miles away to move and i have no income..i honestly dont know how im gonna manage on my own. "
35,Is my mom a narcissist? Im mentally exhausted and don't know if I'm crazy,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb36dc320>,amyeet,0,4,3,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536137040.0,9d4jtx,"My relationship with my mom has always been best described as walking on eggshells. It's only gotten worse since I'm going through my teenage phase, where I'm standing up for myself. Here's some things that have happened, that make me question whether she is a narcissist or not. Bear in mind she is a good mother, she cooks, cleans, looks after me when I'm sick, takes me to school, does the mom-things all moms do. I dont know if she's a narcissist if shes caring in that sense. Is she emotionally a narcissist? What is she? Aahhh. Anyways take a look.

* When I was really young (like 10-13) and we had problems, she'd smash her head against the wall crying and saying she doesn't want to live anymore. It really freaked me out
* Again when I was young and we'd fight, shed throw all my shit on the ground (clothes, toys). Then apologise later and say ""I didn't mean that""
* Always says ""you'll know once I'm dead"", ""you'll be happy once I'm dead"" ""you'll appreciate me once I'm dead"". I told her I do not want to hear her say things like that because they upset me, and she will laugh/smile and say ""but it's the truth"" and doesn't stop doing that.
* She used to say ""you know that I can die anytime, and I have a feeling very soon"" or ""my fortune teller says I'll die next year"" a lot, but she stopped ever since I started responding with ""me too. I could get hit by a car, age doesn't have anything to do with it.""
* Showed me her vagina once? She saw mine and then said something like, ""that's not how it's supposed to look like! whats wrong with it?"" and then showed me hers. Can't unsee that. Eugh
* We had a really bad fight. I started crying and asking why she was ""doing this to me"" and in response she just fucking laughed and smiled, and said some weird sadistic shit. I dont remember all the details but it was unsettling to say the least.
* Most fights end with me apologising.
* Her apologies dont feel genuine. Or even an act of passive aggression eg: ""Fine! I'm sorry, everything is my fault! It's all my fault! You're perfect and nothings wrong about you, it's all my fault"".
* Doesn't seem to respect my boundaries. I ask her as nicely as I can, if she can ""leave me alone for a few hours"" and explain I'm in a bad mood and need to be alone. She always bursts in after a while and asks what happened and whats wrong. I say I don't want to tell her but she insists and then after I tell her I feel like shit.
* When I say ""stop touching me"" (like when she pats my bum or strokes my thighs/legs) shes like ""I can do whatever I want, you are my child/you came from my womb"" and I feel really pissed off. She also used to wash my back and got offended when I didn't want her to see me naked anymore.
* Gets mad when I call her out on her hypocrisies and bullshit, but I only do that when I feel unfairly accused. Denies them or says ""why are you bringing up the past?"" ""why can't you let things go?"".
* From 12-15, my mom would sit me down when my dad wasn't home, and talk about what's wrong with dad. Like the time she thought he cheated on her with her friends, accusations of adultery, everything wrong with my dad, how he's like his own shitty father, how he's disgusting, how he only likes ""sex"", a lot of private stuff that messed up my dad and I's relationship. She always ended with ""oh but your dad loves you. You should still respect him"". Worst part is that she got mad when I told her ""stop telling me these things"" and ""go tell a therapist or your friends, not your child"". She continued to tell me until sometime when I was 16 because every time she tried to tell me I said ""no, don't want to hear. If you tell me I won't listen.""
* Her life lesson for me was ""never trust men"". ""Only your family will love you. No one else will truly love you as much as I do""
* I read somewhere that narcissist mothers are sexually competitive with their daughters? Dont know if this counts but she always tells me about how sexy she was when she was my age, how she was skinnier than me and had big tits, how shed have a ton of male attention. When someone says I'm pretty, my mom will say ""that's from my genes""
* Calls me chubby all the time
* I remember someone said to me ""oh you look so much more beautiful than either your mom or dad"" and my mom was visibly offended, and said ""oh well she has to get her beauty from her mom, or someone"". I think she feels insecure.
* She always puts down my dad's looks, says hes the ""least looking guy"" shes dated, and that she ""settled"" for him.
* She uses passive aggressiveness and silent treatment regularly, especially when she doesn't get her own way (even small things like not going to the restaurant she wants to go to, not drinking a glass of water etc)
* I went through a recent break up. Told her ""please don't mention his name"". She DOES. Whenever she does and I say ""I told you to stop"", she gets visibly upset.
* Never says thank you, excuse me, I love you. That's fine, but then she gets mad when I dont.
* Seems jealous when I get along with my dad. She left for a month to look after grandma (see she's not a bad person) and Dad and I spent a month together. Honestly, the most peaceful and emotionally stable month I'd had in a long time. When she came back and saw how well Dad and I were getting along, she got upset and awkward about it, and then said ""fine I'll LEAVE if you two get along with each other so well.""
* Always complains about me being an incapable child and how I don't do enough. But when I want independence, and start doing things for myself, she gets upset too. As though she doesn't want me to break the reliance on her. Id rather rely on myself but its so hard because she wont let me do shit for myself (eg complains about how I never cook. I cook myself dinner, she says it tastes meh and then insists she will make dinner next time. Doesn't seem to know what she wants??)
* Wont fight fairly. Talks over me. Doesn't really listen or understand, but gets upset when I wont confide in her.
* Looks wayyyy too into things. I told her ""thanks for lunch, it was delicious"" and she got mad at my tone of voice, saying i was being ""cold"".
* Says shit like ""sometimes you dont act like my daughter"" or ""i dont feel like you are my daughter anymore"" or ""im not your mother"" then later says ""haha sometimes I say things i dont mean"" but it hurts.
* When I do tell her about my problems, she says ""oh i get it"" and then goes on about some story that happened in her life. Doesn't really help.
* Everything I say or do around her, I worry about it sparking another argument.
* She complains about her life and acts like dad and I don't have problems. Always acts like the world revolves around her, she has the most difficult life, shes the only one who works and is tired, when in fact she works from home whilst dad is a tradie and goes out working all day, and im at school 6 hrs a day, getting ready for yr12 which is really important
* Fought with me the day before I had a MASSIVE test. She knew about that too.
* She treats me REAAALLY nicely sometimes, and then does a 180 and becomes cold and cruel
* Wants me to be better than other people. Doesn't want me to date anyone below my level (aka she doesnt want me to date a tafe student or tradie??)
* We got into a fight before a piano exam of mine, and when I came back and said ""i might have failed, dont feel confident"" she non-jokingly said ""good. i knew this would happen."" i ended up getting an A and felt really resentful of my mom.
* Seems like she cannot handle the TINIEST bit of criticism from ANYONE.

My dad and I feel the same way about mom: she is childish, immature, emotionally unstable and inconsiderate when it comes to other peoples emotions. We're so tired of it.

I think mom is trying to get better but its like there are two parts of her fighting. One part is horrible and the other wants to be a good mom. I'm so tired and terrified of the unpredictability

If you could tell me what you think she is... id really appreciate it.

And if you could tell me what I should do. She agreed on leaving time to time (to our holiday house) but often doesn't follow through until a masssiiive argument.

I agree dad and I can be more appreciative, but her constant complaining, nagging, criticisms, fighting make it difficult to express positive feelings.

Anyways. Please respond.. I cant let this go on. I have to focus on my studies, I have to get my life together, I've been turning to alcohol as a way to feel better but its self destructive and I'm trying to stop.

TDLR I love my mom but I can't stand her. Is she a narcissist?"
36,Ndad’s flying monkeys RSVPed yes to the baby shower this Sunday,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb1e92ba8>,liedownwithdogs,0,5,3,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536142661.0,9d53my,"hi everyone. been in this community for a while now, just created this account to keep it separate from my main. thanks in advance for whatever advice and support you guys can give, i’ve been feeling pretty edgy about these two flying monkey-related issues I have.

the overall situation/background: 
i am experimenting with VLC and an information diet with my Ndad, it’s been a couple of months now. We live in the same city and he’s still married to my mom (who has surprisingly grown out of her Emom’s past of enabling and is now pretty supportive, considering) otherwise I would be completely NC with him. I’m in my thirties and live with my spouse, who is my
rock and protector against these toxic people.

Still, I know for a fact that Ndad has been peddling his “woe is me, my daughter hates me” bullshit all over town, especially to his female siblings. He also recently had minor surgery that (surprise surprise) he has been milking for all it’s worth, and I haven’t said shit bc i don’t fucking care.

—Problem number ONE:
 this sunday i have to attend a family baby shower (not mine) without my spouse, and I am already filled with so much dread about the flying monkeys that will no doubt descend on me, just like they always do. 

——Advice request ONE:
I could really use some helpful deflection tactics and ways to brush off their barbs without letting them sink in. Fwiw, I’ve been in therapy for the past year and working on my boundary strength. It’s been helpful but I still struggle with sticking to the script for moments like these, and I don’t want to give them any kind of reaction whatsoever.

— Problem number TWO:
the expectant family member is due right around christmas, and she’s been hosting Christmas Eve dinner for the past few years. This dinner is a horrific triggering nightmare of endless narc bullshit. Before I found out about the due date, I was planning to skip it altogether because I am fucking DONE. But now, since I’m in the same town, of a similar age, and have a spouse and home of my own, I can imagine all of these flying monkeys champing at the bit to demand that I host this year. It’d be right in their wheelhouse to corner me at this baby shower and make their ridiculous expectations known.

—— Advice request TWO:
I am gonna need all the help i can get to make my “no” loud and clear without lying, making excuses, or being vague enough that I end up kicking that can further down the road. I also want to stay interactive and grey rock so that they don’t latch onto whatever I say and fly into a rage.

Nothing has happened yet because I have been staying off their radar ever since I realized what my family put me through, but the anticipation of Sunday’s baby shower has me completely dialed up to eleven.

So, what do I do? If my aunts say “your father misses you, why are you so mean to him, can’t you see he loves you” or “maybe it’s your turn to do something for this family for once and host christmas eve” I need to have some responses in hand so I can breezily rattle them off in the moment and keep it fuckin moving. I’m not a great liar and I’m pretty awkward at changing the subject, but if I have some concrete things to practice for the next four days I think it’ll help.

and yes, I already thought about skipping or faking an illness, but my mother is cohosting and she doesn’t have the wherewithal to lie on my behalf. she’s still pretty trapped in the FOG when it comes to her own relationships with these people and I don’t want to involve her in my own recovery. 

plus, this may be a useful and productive opportunity for me to practice what I’ve been working on in therapy before the holiday season rolls around this year. hooray for silver linings? i guess?

So, RBN redditors: got any advice? if so, what worked for you? or, what didn’t work? I hope you can help me, thanks for always being such an awesome and supportive community.

—TL;DR— 
i need advice for ways to non-confrontationally change the subject, deflect emotional barbs, and otherwise ignore my Ndad’s flying monkeys at a family baby shower this Sunday. see numbered problems ONE and TWO (and their corresponding advice requests) above to get the specifics. Thanks."

I noticed that my coolant was low yesterday, so I went to the store and picked some up. Now, I had never learned anything about car maintenance, because my father was desperate to keep us dependent on him. I left home at 21, and literally taught myself everything. How to open a checking account. Credit cards. How to drive on the highway. Cooking. I didn't have much opportunity until later to do the car stuff, especially when I first moved out, as I relied on public transportation and the shoe leather express. I have a car now, and I have been looking on YouTube for tutorials on basic maintenance, including how to fix a flat tire, how to check the oil (I live in an apartment, so changing it myself isn't practical right now, but I want to learn), how to check the coolant, etc. 

These may all seem like basic things to normal people, but I posted something about this in an Ask Reddit thread, and a redditor offered some other advice about things I'd want to look into, and then he said ""In case he never told you, I'm proud of you."" A complete stranger on the Internet. And so, when coming home with my coolant, I felt a sense of pride of the things I have accomplished in the last ten years, even with the bumps and mental breakdowns along the way. I had flashbacks to my school days where I had to miss class, and had to inform my teacher, and had to tell him I was missing class because I had to testify against a family member (My father eventually did time, but that's a story for another day). He told me what I needed to do schoolwise, but I could see the look in his eyes that his heart was breaking. Before I left, he said in a broken voice ""Hang in there"".  I remember only responding ""I hope I can"". Well, here I am years later, a nurse, in a loving marriage and relationship, and dedicating my life to making the world a better place for everyone.

&#x200B;

So, my fellow ACONs, and younger CONs (for lack of a better term), be proud of the small steps of independence you are taking. Hang in there and keep on marching on. And know that I, an internet stranger am proud of what you accomplish to get out of this hellhole."

It's the most hopeful, joyous feeling I've had in a long time. I'm trying to just keep things simple and as peaceful as possible in these last few days because when my N knows I'm doing well, she has to take me down a few pegs, and honestly I'm just so tired of dealing with that. 

Anyway, last night's dinner as disgusting as it was made me happy because this is one of the last times I'll ever have to eat meat that I know was questionably prepared. My N gets physically aggressive with me, so I have to eat what she prepares or face getting hit or having something like a knife drawn on me. You know, the usual. 

Dinner was just a pile of chicken. Literally only chicken. She only ever wants to cook a single item when she cooks, because she loves to put in minimal effort and then go on like a martyr for it. 

Normally, I cook so I have at least some control over what I eat, but she likes to cook at least once a week. 

There's a story about this chicken, because my N is an idiot and lazy. Great combo in the kitchen, right? So, we bought the chicken like four or five months ago. She let it sit in the fridge for five days before deciding that yes, we should freeze it, because we can never take my suggestions right away. So, this chicken ended up getting freezer burned. She takes it out last week and decides to thaw it in the windowsill because ""the air will move around it and thaw it very well because of physics"", and yes that's a direct quote. Then, the chicken sits in the fridge for another five or so days before she decides it's ready to cook. 

So, that was the dinner I was forced to choke down. I have horrid stomach cramps and other symptoms of food poisoning, but I've gotten used to living this way. I've gotten used to this. I'm excited that this will be one of the last times this will ever happen. I'm almost free. 

I just have to survive this last stretch and I'm out. "

We had a conversation about 30 minutes ago and she was just so mad saying that now I started applying to jobs Im “talking over her head” , and keeps saying that she gave birth to me, I didn’t give birth to her, and she said now that I have money I think I’m above her, and keeps reminding me that my friends are telling me bad things, but in reality I just need money to take ACT/SAT and save up to get away from her (aka college). 

She always promises me things that she’ll give me but never has 
-a phone, new shoes, or even just a shirt. 

I’m just so done. 


Is there anyone who can help me, with how I can go about this? 
Or How go on about moving out of my house after I graduate, because I won’t be 18 quite yet?"

TL;DR : N friend had issues with her life and health, but as soon as I had problems with my heart, I was a liar. She would ""LOVE me no matter how much I lied.""  She used me to be a martyr. Now Nparents might shack with Nfriend.



I should be working right now. I have so much to get done for clients, and I've wasted my whole day, stressing, being angry, and bitter about this girl who won't leave me alone. But I need to get it out. I need SOMEONE to know.
 Hai. I'm Palaver, and I had a narcissistic friend.  

In this story, we are going to call her Annie. 

I grew up with Nparents, and by the time I realized, it was already a little too late for my sanity. I snapped, packed my bags, and ran away to my boyfriend's house, who's parents, lovingly brought me into their home.  This was ten years ago. Back track seven years, and I will have met Annie at a friend's party. She told me the story about how she came from South Carolina, had been homeless, on drugs, but was now clean, and moving back in with her mom, to help her mom take care of her home. From what I was told, her mom had health problems. (Mainly IBS, but she told me a list of other things that I can't remember now.) Annie is....a little slow to say the least. Common sense ain't common for her, but she was a GENUINELY nice person. Really really fun, happy, bubbly to be around. I figured. Hell. Let's hang out more.

We did, and for seven years our relationship was pretty good for the most part. She was unrealistic as to what her strengths and weaknesses were, ( she considers herself a musician/poet/artist, none of which she does well.)  but I supported her regardless.  I was told all kinds of crazy stories. One of which was when she tried committing suicide by jumping off a short bridge; but before doing so, she tied a red scarf around the railing. So people knew. And would remember the pain that they caused her. Obviously she lived, but I wonder if her brain got a little scrambled. She told me how she didn't remember certain people or events, or how they knew her. She told me about how she had done mean things to people, and now she was trying to make amends with everyone. So apparently, this jump gave her a personality skip as well. 

In her presence, I DID notice that people kinda treated her like shit. She would often send me messages of screen caps of the shitty things people said to her. I was kind of floored at the animosity she was being shown, and more often than not, it was often a jealous wife, or a husband claiming that she needed to leave him alone. I repeatedly told her that she needed to pick a better clan of people to hang out with. That maybe she judged people poorly; but her response was that she could see the good in everyone, and that they always deserve a second chance.  Being her friend, I did my best to give the best advice I could but it did little to stymie her personal drama. 

At one point her mom kicked her out of the house, and told Annie that she didn't need her around to take care of her. Annie broke down telling me that her mom let her be raped, by letting her live with this nasty older ex husband when she was a kid, and that no one believed her. And since it seemed like THE WHOLE town knew about her, and hated her guts (the first obvious sign that completely went over my head.) I figured hey. I live with my boyfriend and his family. Maybe they can help.

Bf's family are kind caring, progressive christian people. They own a farm and there's always a need for an extra pair of hands. I was on my way out of the business at that time; found a school in the state that I'm living in now to pursue my career. Both of us were working hard to get our lives on track, so I figured we could help each other. I was going to need an apartment. She needed her GED, a license, money and a place to stay during that time before she left the state. So with the approval of BF's family, I got her a job, a place to live, helped her study for her GED and let her drive my car to practice, before I ultimately left. The plan was she would join us when she had everything fulfilled that she wanted to have fulfilled. 

Now, this girl never really had a job before. She would do odd ball cleaning for people, and then apparently get fucked over; but she couldn't get a REAL job, because she was on SSI and didn't want the extra money from taxes to interfere with her benefits. BF's father paid her under the table to remedy that issue. Everything seemed fine. She was well on her way. I moved. 

That's when the phone calls started. They were always at 8, 9, 10 pm, and I was usually getting on to the train from school to go home. She would be teary, and crying. Her health was bad. Her feet hurt so badly. Her digestion was fuckie. She had a lump in her armpit. She was vomiting all the time. She just had THINGS wrong with her. She went to the hospital several times for pain that was undiagnosed, as far as I know. She had people drive her to the ER several times in the middle of the night. (Granted it's a farm so we all got up at like. 6am?) The biggest thing that she refused to get help with was her mental health, to which she claimed she was not mentally unwell, but I'm pretty sure she's borderline. Flips on a switch type of thing. I'd seen her do these things before, but she had never played them out on me. I was her BEST friend. Her only friend at the time probably. 

She couldn't work at the farm, it was too hard. BF parents were ""keeping her from getting her education."" This made no sense to me because they had gladly said goodbye to me, when i told them I was going to school out of state. BUT. BF parents are old school in some aspects, so I wondered if BF's dad was being hard on her. These conversations would end with me telling her it was going to be okay. That we just had to get things in order. That she could do this. This was the easy part. She'd be hopeful by the end of the conversation (You're the best Palaver, you're such a good friend, yadda yadda.) and we would end it. Until she would call three-four days later. Same stories. MORE stories.

The family had betrayed her. There was a tenant that stole her stuff. No one would listen. She wanted to lock her door, but BF dad, said no, we don't lock doors in this house. She complained about how much rent she was being charged, which I couldn't stand to listen to because it was 200.00 as opposed to the 850 that I was paying as a family member. But after rent, she had NO money left because of health/medical bills. This all upset me, and made me feel bad. I didn't realize that the environment was going to be so rough for her. it was never my intention of just ""leaving"" her there, but she didn't want to move from out of the state until she had a, b and c checked off from her life list goals. 

Still with me? I appreciate it. 

I worked harder to try and get her to this state before she completely blew a gasket. It was partially my fear that the family would hate me for inviting her idiocy into the home. It was also my fear that Annie would feel abandoned. The calls continued. 

One christmas ago I went and visited the farm. She was still living there at that point, and was getting into a not-so-serious relationship with a boy from a near by farm. She told me that she thought that he was ""stupid and slow."" To which I thought, pot calling the kettle black, but everyone has their threshold of stupidity that they can handle. All I saw however, was that this boy, (Let's call him Brian.) was nothing but a gentleman to her. Drove her to the ER when she needed it, worked her shifts when she was too sick. Made her food, waited on her hand and foot. She wasn't ""interested"" in him and she had told Brian that she was moving out of state with me at some point so don't get attached. Brian agreed that it was important for her to get a higher education. Funny enough, about a month later Brian got some kind of cancerous tumor in his arm. And all of a sudden, she couldn't LEAVE him.  She HAD to help him through his treatments, and that she would join us after he was better. They were going to get married. He was going through chemo and all this other stuff. I DID confirm that at least part of this story was true, but her flip into needing to be a white knight kind of irritated me. But I've never, to this day told her that. 

After all her health problems she comes up to me one day and I'm severely stressing out because I have a heart problem, that's undiagnosed and my heart is beating too slow. (Somewhere between 45-40 BPM) I hadn't told Annie because she was dealing with her own shit. Granted I don't tell most people in my life what's going on except for my BF, but she sussed it out of me, and I told her. She offered very little comfort and immediately started telling me about her mom, and her mom's heart problems. I waved it off, and was like, okay thanks. I didn't think anything about it, and she didn't seem deterred. She even gave me a bunch of phony diagnosis because her mom is a registered nurse. 

Back track now, 6 months ago, a mutual friend of me and my BF went suddenly ill into a diabetic coma, and we thought she was going to die. So we ended up back in the state. During the off time that I wasn't at the hospital, I tried to make some kind of plans to hang out with Annie, since I WAS around and everything. At this point, not-so-serious boyfriend had her living with him in his little shack outside of town because the farm environment was just too hard for her. She had also poisoned him with lies about my BF's family and so he quit as well. We hung out one night together, all three of us, and it seemed fine. Did what we usually did, which was basically shooting the shit and chain-smoking cigarettes.  The next morning, I got messages on my cell from her VIA facebook. She went on and on about how if I was in the hospital she would come and visit me. (Trim my toenails apparently was one of the things she had in mind.) Frankly she's so loud and annoying most times that I told her, I really wouldn't want anyone there but my close family and my bf. We had a big conversation about how she would fight security; stupid conversation you know?  And then the comment, that ticked me off and started everything:

Annie: Well you're broke and your parents don't have money either, someone would have to pay those bills. 

One, I wasn't broke. Two, for some reason, her just telling me that I can't handle my own bills, while she's apparently floundering with her bills AND can't seem to save up for an apartment, kind of made me blow my lid. After she insisted that she would work her ass off for me, I responded that I had a support network and that I could handle those things on my own. Call it a matter of pride I suppose. She then goes to tell me:

You're a dick sometimes.  
Like I'm used to a lot of the stuff you say. You lie sometimes and I just pat it away. My love for you is unconditional because I see your worth as a person, and honestly everyone needs a friend who would go through that amount of trouble to have you around
Nothing you do or say will keep away my loyality. If you push I will be at a distance but with a hopeful spirit.
Simply Palaver,  you're important. Not just to me. But what you do has its affects and I enjoy seeing them

I asked her what I lied about and her response floored me. Here's a small portion of our conversation that I archived, in the event she ever wanted to come back at me with twisted lies.

Annie:  You lie or over exaggerate details. You've done it a lot throughout our friendship. Sometimes I ask why you do it when I've been nothing but honest with you. But I accept it because sometimes its just what you believe or think in the moment and they may not be lies but venting and scenario building. Like a month ago you said you were diagnosed with a heart condition which for years you said you had one. But your ma said you didn't. I didn't care much for what she said but then suddenly youre undiagnosed? And you don't know what's wrong?   Its a small detail but you're important to me so it matters to know what's really going on 

Me:  But know you embellish your own stories. It's a give and take relationship. I don't outright lie. I suspected I had a heart problem. Now I'm being diagnosed. I had no way of actually knowing. I dont know what's wrong, and neither does my cardiologist right now.

Annie:  Why would you tell me you were diagnosed with a heart condition when you still don't know

Me:  
Because I am. I have a condition that causes my heart to beat irregularly, but they don't know why it does. I feel like sometimes you can jump to conclusions without asking the right questions. I have no reason to lie about that
Lol like why?
I was telling you because I was stressed and going through the testing


The convo goes on and on with more petty bullshit, her response to this was,"" well I don't believe you, and I talked to your mom and she doesn't remember you having a heart problem at all.""  That I lied about that, that I lied about dropping out of school. Then it was; you don't know what suffering is. You've always had BF's family since you were a little girl. I've always been on my own, and homeless. No one helps me. No one supports me. Generic solutions aren't going to fix my problems. I'm not like other people. Your advice is useless for someone who has nothing.  It's like telling African children to grow a garden without seeds.  I slept in drug houses and under bridges. I did whatever I could to just survive. Palaver, as much as you want to believe we are similar. Our history is not.""

I got sick of her pity cries at this point. Called her out for wallowing in it. At this point, she must NOT have wanted me to be able to save any part of the convo, because she started talking to me through voice recordings. They're mostly incomprehensible saying me, me, me, life is too hard.  Put yourself in my shoes. Even though when I tried, I could never compare to her painful existence. 

Pain poker. It had literally become a game of pain poker. And I realized; this is what she did to other people, but now she has her boyfriend. She had Brian. And because she had Brian, there was a safety net for her to create drama. I was no longer safe from her. The kicker to the conversation was when she told me no matter what I did she would always love me and be loyal. Even from afar. Essentially, I tell lies, and she's the martyr who's a good person no matter what. I told her I didn't want to be that kind of friend for her. That if that was how she viewed our relationship, that I had, essentially, become a toxic friend to her, enabling her delusions. She got upset about this, and blocked me on facebook, after getting the last word.

I'm not one for petty blocks and unblocks. I just don't play with that shit. She decided to cut the tie right then and there by throwing a tantrum and blocking me. So I said fine. I blocked her back. I blocked her number. I blocked every aspect of her from my life. She sent her BF Brian after me to tell me that I was mean, and that I hurt her feelings. That ""I need to talk to her now.""  I said. Okay. Then I blocked him too. 

Obviously because the situation wasn't resolved for her,  she's made her rounds calling my family, trying to worm her way in any way she can.

She messages BF parents telling them that 'she misses the farm and that she loves everyone."" She called my Aunt Sally's cell phone (somehow she got the number?) asking how Grandma was, and that she would like to take them out to eat. Aunt Sally knows this girl's crazy, and tried to explain that she understood that me and Annie had a falling out, to which Annie promptly responded, ""Well it's more Palaver's fault than mine."" 

Her recent stunt has included talking to my mom on facebook. I'm still in contact with both Nparents, though at a distance, and I limit my phone conversations with them before I get hostile.  My nparents, who are pretty brain dead, are in the process of being homeless. Now I'm in no financial or homing situation where I can help them get back on their feet, so even if I wanted to I can't.  My mom had posted something on facebook along the lines of, ""we might be homeless, if such and such doesn't play out well."" Annie messaged my mom, who then in turn showed me screen caps of what was sent. Basically along the lines of:

Here's my contact information. I know Palaver can't help you, and because I couldn't move out of the state like I planned, I was homeless for a while so I know how that goes. I completely understand I'm always here for you."" 

This would be my greatest nightmare come true if Nparents ended up shacking with Nfriend. I told my mom not to take her up on her offer, and she responded by telling me ""Well I'm not going to burn any bridges."" I immediately flipped my shit and told Nmom (who's emotional manipulation I learned from her no doubt) that if she did take Annie up on her offer that I wouldn't be able to talk to her anymore.  This was just one more power play. One more way for Nfriend to try and get under my skin and into my life. One more way for Annie to tell everyone what a GOOD person she is.  I didn't tell my mom that I would cut her out of my life to be manipulative; but for my own emotional health and sanity, I just couldn't allow it to enter my life. That and I obviously want to help my parents, so it make me look like a shit person. Also a quick check with nmom has confirmed that Annie NEVER spoke to her about my health problems. 

Not to mention my fake heart condition has me pretty ill today. I'm pretty sure my irregular heart rates are because of my lack of stress management, and this today, has certainly proved that. 

I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to ever get this girl out of my life. I just want it to end. I feel stupid for ever trying to help her to begin with. I've taken the higher road as much as possible and I haven't communicated with her on any level since blocking her from my life. I know she's poking. She's poking to get a reaction. She does this until people snap and say horrible horrible things about her.  She brings the worst out in people. 

I'm pretty sure she might actually be a demon. "

She'll say that she has always been there for me and that  she has gone above and beyond to support me but that it's never enough (ironically she also says that nothing i do in life will ever be good enough).

To share my example, when I was 11 in 7th grade, during the throes of puberty, I developed really bad cystic acne. I can't recall how this regimen began exactly, but it got to a point where my nMom would lock the two of us in the bathroom at the end of the night (around 9/10 pm), soak a washcloth in scorching hot water, use it to scrape my face like she was trying to scratch old paint off of wood, then would push me up against a wall with her body weight, and use her thumbs/nails to start popping all of my pimples.  

&nbsp; 

The entire ordeal would last 1-2 hours. If I ever spontaneously yelped-out ""OW!"" or twitched my face/body from the pain, she would start slapping my arms and face because I ""hurt her ears from shouting"" or ""messed her up"". Her rationale was that if my acne went unchecked, I would develop pock marks when I was older, so marring my face for 2 hours every night was necessary to protect from any scaring. Naturally, I was too young and stupid to do this on my own, so my nMom would force this on me every night, never showing my how or why I should take care of my face, only that she knew best.  

&nbsp; 

I would go always go to school the next day, having my face decorated with bruises and scabs from all the picking. It got to a point where I found a bathroom at school that no one ever went into at lunch that had a mirror, and started to poke my face. I thought if I could do it myself, I could be more gentle, it would hurt less, and I could go to sleep earlier. When our cleansing ritual rolled around, nMom was infuriated that I ""*destroyed my face behind her back*"" while whipping me with a slipper. After that, when I woke up in the morning, she would take stock of all the fresh new blemishes and document them. It was indicated that if I returned home with scabs where the new pimples had formed, I would be severely punished.

In science class, they would show us an episodes of Bill Nye and there was one where they discussed skin care and warned that breaking the skin could spread bacteria, increasing the possibility of breaking out. I remember feeling this overwhelming sense of relief thinking I would tell my nParents this and I wouldn't have to deal with my nightly abuse anymore. Nope, I ""*was lying*"", and if it actually did happen, a ""*kids shows don't know what it's talking about*"" so the abuse continued. It wasn't until I was a Freshman in High School that my skin got so bad I had to go to a Dermatologist who prescribed me Accutane, while having a sit in with me and my nMom, I asked the Doctor about poking pimples, and he was adamant that was probably one of the worst ways to achieve clear skin and I remember nMom getting visibly agitated/uncomfortable.  

&nbsp;

On the ride home I couldn't help rubbing it in her face, after having to suffer every night for 3 years and she started telling me how I was an ungrateful little ""*shet*"" (*nMom is from South America*) and how God would punish me for not honoring her. When I've brought this instance up as an adult, nMom gasps dramatically while faking crying, saying ""*Ayyyyeeeeeeeee! Senor Jesucristo! I never deed dat! You es lying!*""  

&nbsp;  

Sorry for my Magna Carta of an explanation, but I'm curious if anyone else suffered through similar self-serving abuse / sabotauge disguised as ""help""?"

I've read all over the place that in her condition (suspected antisocial personality disorder), she doesn't even really know she's doing anything wrong and there very little hope at ""fixing"" her, so I just let her yell. I knew that saying anything would make it worse and there was nothing I could say to make it better. So I just let her go. She was going on for so long I was hoping she might realize that *I'm* not the one with an anger problem that she so intently claims I have.

I wasn't as angry as I thought I would be. Normally, I get so mad that she thinks she's in the right and that I lost the fight but I didn't feel that way this time. I was able to acknowledge that it really doesn't matter how she feels, she's always going to feel the same way about me. I've started to settle with the fact that I have a mom who's simply empty. It's not that I've lost anything, there was just never anything there in the first place. It's a shame that it took me so long to realize how to handle it, but at least it'll be easier to go NC.

I made a post yesterday talking about how my sister and Nmom got into an argument, with me recording it. I forgot to mention that my grandmother--Nmom's mother--was there to also witness this. Here's a little exchange from that:

>Grandma: I'm not, though...

I don't think my grandmother is really that tired. She may be 80+-years-old, but she keeps herself busy with a few household chores like laundry, sweeping, and cooking. Besides that, she spends the whole day watching TV. The most physical thing she'll do is go for a neighborhood walk, and that's only a few times a week. So I don't think she's really that ""tired"" from being at home all day.

My theory is that my Nmom realized that because she gave that whole spiel about how kids *have* to listen to their parents in front of her mother, her mother will give her a harder time. Because here's the thing, my grandmother has actually been much more vocal about her displeasure about her daughter's behavior in recent years and has even grilled her a few times. Like, properly call her out and bring up all of her bad traits and misdeeds. And I think because Nmom said all that bullshit, her mother might just use that against her. Hence, she's sending her mom back early.

The only sad thing here is that she's sending her mother back during typhoon season, where things are always flooded and getting destroyed. My Nmom would rather put an 80+-year-old woman--who is her own mother, no less--in potential danger than possibly having to deal with said mother scolding her even more than she usually does. But again, I guess the good thing is that this just further reinforces how much of a monster she is."
58,Finally told her the truth!,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb26c2f60>,AlexisO87,0,1,2,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536139126.0,9d4qug,"Sorry for the long backround and story.

Grew up with extremely abusive father and binge drinking mother. Both narcissistic AF. Moved out when I was a teenager,(16) and never spoke to them. Until I became an adult I began to feel guilty for resenting them.(Thinking maybe my memories were exaggerated considering I was a teenager.)  And so I moved back to the city they reside in and started talking again (This was about 12 years later). Taking them out for dinners, movies etc. But quickly began to realize (even though my father is to old to beat me anymore) they never really changed. They are both horrible right wing extremist that are racists and hypocrites about religion. And my mother's drinking had only gotten worse. Hospital visits due to seizures (even bit her own tongue off) . the amount of emotional distress it was causing me nearly sent me into ending my own life and destroying the only good relationship I have ever had. So I went back to NC again.

Months later (est. 8+ months) my mother had called me several times. Not hearing from them since I went NC. I thought maybe it may have been some sort of important family emergency. So I text her back later asking what she wanted. (Months go by in a flash for her as she's usually drunk 24/7 for about 3-4 months then will be sober for a couple weeks and the cycle continues.) She just replied with ""Haven't heard from you in a while. Just wanted to see what you are up to."" As if we haven't talked for that week.

Angry, and not wanting to hear from her again I text back telling her that she is a narcissist that only cares about herself and the bottle, she lives with a man who beat me for half of my life. (They recently took in a man who needed a place to stay for a while who coincidently also molested me as a child) Told her that the man she now calls a roommate was a child molester. (Never told them that he molested me and a couple of other girls o found out recently) That my brother and his girl friend are sociopaths that commit fraud to make money. And that her and all those people that I once called family in that house are people I never want to see or speak to ever again.

I never got a reply back from her. But these last few days I have never felt more free! I feel good about finally telling the truth about why I don't want to see them ever again, instead of just disappearing like I normally do. I know I should probably seek therapy to finally be rid of all my demons( as I suffer with depression and a taste for alcohol myself) . But I felt like this was a big step for me. Even if she was probably drunk by the time she got the message. It feels good to finally get it out there.

Side note: Before I get any comments on my mother and her drinking, know that for years while I was NC with my father, I tried to get my mother help with her drinking. And she not only relapsed every time but she would take others down with her. Convince people in her AA meetings to get a drink with her. And even people in half way houses that were months sober. "

I made a blueberry cake and overall it took me about 2 hours including prepping and baking time, ate a slice cos why not, and then offered my mum the next one.

Soon as she sees it
""Oh it looks too stodgy""

""The slice is too big"" (considering id cut it into 12 when the recipe said to cut it into 8)

""I need ____ with this"" considering id just spent 2 hours on my feet without a break, and she just asks for more.

""Its not even cooked properly"" well maybe if youd not given all our baking stuff away id have been able to practice more, plus my slice was fine, she just had the very middle slice and it wasnt /entirely/ perfect.
etc etc


I was goddamn proud of that cake, ive never made a blueberry cake before and honestly i think it turned out amazing.
I dont usually do this but i actually told her she'd upset me by complaining repeatedly about it before she actually said anything nice at all. She responded by giving vague and forced compliments about it, probably to keep me happy since im moving out so soon.

And yes, she ate it anyway.

60,How to not feel bad gor my nmom?,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb185a470>,finnabustanuut,0,2,1,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536152135.0,9d69mk,"Hey everybody,

First i am so happy to found this subreddit. I love everyone of you for helping each other and being so strong although we all had it hard in life. My mom is a narcissist with depression, bipolar disorder and light schizophrenia. My dad was never in my life, he was always ""working"" and i saw him maybe one day in a week. After 2008 my parents split and i saw him maybe 20 times after that. My nmom is very very very intelligent. I think all narcissist are intelligent but shes just mind blowing. She would always think evrything out even before you could realize her first step. She knew how to manipulate any and everyone. She overthought anything she does to get to her goal. That makes it very difficult to see through her facade and see er her honest and evil intentions. My problem at the moment is that i told her  that i will move out in 4 months. Shes kind of supportive, maybe because she wants to livd with my stepdad alone but like i said, its hard to see her real intentions. But shes starting to make me feel bad for her. She cries occasionally and i am starting to ask myself if shes just act like this to make me bound to her. So when things with my stepdad doesnt work out well because hes a aggressive asshole, she hopes that i will take care of her when shes old. Anyways, i was the golden child and i always felt bad for my mom. This pity makes it hard for me to seperate my life from hers. Everything i see makes me feel sad for her in a fucked up way. Its just like the tragic of her and our life.  I try to remind me of the bad things shes done to us but as a golden child i wasnt physical abused like my sister. 
I am a very emphatic guy in general.
How do i stop feeling bad for her?"
61,The nightmare that is my father.,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfaea1bac8>,yourmumslefttoe,0,3,4,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536124790.0,9d3c9d,"My father has always placed himself as his first priority. Not caring how his actions effect other. 18 years ago he left his first child and all of his family behind and moved to china ""to be with my mother"". The thing is, my mother begged to stay in America. I think becoming an American is part of the reason she agreed to marrying a man 14 years older then herself. My father's real reason in moving to china was for the attention he as a white guy in china gets. 
Cut to about 15 years later. My mother got a job and became independent ie. Didnt feed his ego by relying on him. He cheated on her. They got a divorce. My father now at the age of 57 has a 20 year old thai wife who can barley speak English and is clearly using him for financial reasons. I wouldn't be as angered by this if his children were all adults fending for themselves but I'm 16 and I have 2 younger sisters and we're all being neglected because he values getting laid more then his children. He is spending money he dose not have on his wife while his children survive on top ramen. 
Me and my sister had to constantly ask for chairs to do school work on for over a month and he ends up buying us 5 dollar used chairs off the internet. This is totally fine because financially we're in a tough spot. The problem is that he then turns around and drops 60 bucks on a vanity for his wife because she makes a mess on the bathroom counter when doing her makeup and dosen't want to clean up.
He left us in a foreign country(America) with an alcoholic and borderline insane aunt for 5 months while he was vacationing in Vietnam, Thailand and Hong kong with his wife.
He is overly defensive, can take 0 criticism and has a short temper which has led him to throwing me into a  wall because I called him a irresponsible parent. He once kicked my then 14 year old sister out on the streets of Bangkok at night because she called him a bad father. 
I am angry at and feel bad for him at the same time because I know he will die a lonely old man with all of his children hating him and his wife he cherished so much leaving him once he's too old to take care of her. Despite the fact that he is the only person to blame for his grim future, one can't help but pity him.
I now can't decide if I should just ignore him untill I turn 18 and get kicked out then disowning him as my father and never speaking to him again or if I should try to salvage what's left of our family resulting in more yelling matches,emotional and physical abuse with maybe a chance of everything ending up ok?

I’ve just sat here for a few minutes trying to figure out where to start this story. It’s my story. At least part of it. My father has played a huge role in shaping me into who I am. That’s not a positive thing. For most of my life I’ve felt inferior and that I’ve had to hide myself. I’ve just recently been able to admit that I’m a woman, and with that I’ve begun to step away from my past and embrace something new.

For years, I’ve treated my body as a vessel; merely an unfeeling machine that is to be used to barrel through whatever life throws my way. I’ve never mattered, and my self-esteem is on par with this sentiment. I have an incredible pain tolerance, and suppose I am also a masochist as a result. This is my father’s doing.

It goes without saying that he is a narcissist, possibly even a psychopath/sociopath. He is the cruelest person I know, and I’m someone who was taken advantage of by a cult and forced to perform slave labor for a farm operated by sociopaths. My life is marred with memories that tear me down even to this day. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve fully accepted how outside of normal my life has been.

When everyday is filled with shit, the shit becomes background noise.

This post is prompted by events this morning. One of our snakes, of which our house is filled with (among countless other animals; you can say my father is also a bit obsessive, bordering on insane), regurgitated in its water this morning. He cleaned it and while he was doing so, my stepmom got out of his way and used the bathroom. This was obviously the wrong choice. She should have known that he wanted to dump it in the toilet. She’s so stupid /s

He then ordered my stepmom to clean the snakes water, which she did wrong, and put a fan in the room to vent the air, which she also did wrong. Everything everyone ever does is wrong. Except what he does. He’s perfect. Hence, why his slammed doors like a child this morning is perfectly acceptable behavior.

My stepmom and I chatted and vented about him this morning. It reminded me of everything that’s wrong with him, and everything that’s happened. It’s also shown me that, while he has changed in many regards, he’s still the same person. There’s so fucking much, I can’t possibly explain to you the depth of this man’s assholish behavior. But, I’m going to try to show you some of the highlights of his transgressions.

I remember always being afraid of him. There are so many incidents where I would plead to my mom not to tell my dad. Even shit like spilling milk was a serious cause for concern. I don’t remember what sparked this, but I remember being thrown across the room when I was 4. This prompted my mom to call the cops on him, an event that never happened according to him. Yet, I distinctly remember waving to the police officers while sipping my juice box on my bed with an ice pack on my head. I believe he must have left before they came, because nothing ever happened from that. He might not even know the cops were called.

Wetting the bed and peeing my pants was a huge issue. I tried my damndest not to, but a child has accidents. I remember I would get spanked, hard, for every single drop is dribbled in my pants. I usually wouldn’t be able to sit afterwards. Nowadays, as a consenting adult, that is a feeling I aspire to have, which I am very grateful for my dad to instill this desire in me.

The bathtub was likewise a danger zone. Once, I flooded the bathtub swish swashing back and forth, and I was called a ""rooster-inhaler"" (had to change the slur for the sub, apparently) for the rest of the week. There’s a lot of names he called me, most of which are responsible for internalizing homophobia in me, thus making me afraid/feel wrong that I liked men and wanted to be feminine. I can’t imagine how much better my life would be if I could have explored those things without feeling like the wrath of God would be unleashed upon me. 

The most scarring of these names was “retard faggot.” I still get depressed and call myself retarded. He started using that after my mom passed away when I was nine. Although, he used to call me retarded well before then. When I was seven, I wrote “I am a failure” on the back of one of my notebooks, which he turned into “I am a farter.” When I started crying, he just laughed and when I didn’t stop he called me retarded.

When I was ten, a pipe burst in our basement. Naturally, he was furious and wound up taking that anger out on me. He threw me down on our kitchen floor and smashed my head into it. This lasted about a minute, then he stopped. I stared up at his bald head which looked like a cherry tomato, and reached for my glasses which had gotten flung from my face. He smacked me, then smacked my glasses away, saying I didn’t need them. He then smashed my head into the floor some more. 

Afterwards, he told me to get the door for him. I did. He kept getting madder because I kept doing it wrong. I would open the door a second too early or a second too late. After a few of these horrendous fuck-ups, I was back on the floor. Clearly, I deserved this. I continued to help him, but wound up slamming the door once and causing another incident of head trauma. I was pretty much numb at this point, so when he told me to do my homework, I did. I remember having to juggle opening the door for him and doing my homework at the table. I couldn’t hold my pencil straight.

When he told me that this would be the last load, he stayed outside and smoked. I stood there, paralyzed, unsure of what to do. I end up choosing to do my homework, but this resulted in him coming in and asking “who the fuck told me to do my homework?” I was so afraid I was going on the floor again, but he just shook his head in disbelief that I could be that defiant to his rules.

About fifteen minutes later, his girlfriend calls him, and nothing is wrong. He is completely calm and cheery. We go out to dinner not long after, and it’s like nothing ever happened. This charming persona of his that he can turn on and off is a staple of life with him. You never know how he will act or what he will do.

For instance, when his now ex-wife (the woman after his previously mentioned girlfriend; he went through a lot) left for a weekend dart tournament, my not wanting to play chess with him once set off a chain of events where he functionally tortured me. This was a day’s long session of him beating me, throwing me around, calling me names, and more. He destroyed every single thing my mom every made me, because I didn’t deserve them. I was tossed on the floor and told to “lay there like a dog,” where I had a vacuum slammed into my head as he cleaned up his mess.

After this, I was told to sit and come up with an apology for him. It wasn’t good enough and he told me to stand. I stood there for hours, and nothing I said was good enough for him. I wound up passing out while he lectured me about how ungrateful and horrible of a child I was. Even after that, he wasn’t done with me. It just kept going and going.

I got a hug and a little more than an “I’m sorry” from him the next morning, but since then he has not even acknowledged it. Even when I have brought it up the few times I dared to do so, he’s dismissed it with little more than a shrug. It’s self-evident that he cannot even begin to process how much he fucked up. His ego is too precious; too fragile for consciously acknowledging how badly he hurt me.

In his eyes, he’s the model parent. In reality, I feel like another one of his God-damn pets. When I ran track, he would obsess over everything I did. My successes were his successes that he celebrated with me. But, my fuck ups were mine alone, and always involved getting yelled at and forced to work harder. There was one point where I was literally doing three practices a day and was forcing myself to throw up because I would eat too much.

This sentiment carries over to my half-brother. Everything he does right, it’s because of something my father has done. Everything my brother does wrong, it’s because of his mother. He can’t take any responsibility for his failures. Or anything really. There’s so much clutter in this house and the garage, but my step-mom is a hoarder because she has some stuff downstairs, next to all of his shit.

Our house is falling apart, but neither my stepmom nor I dare to do anything to make it better. Those are his projects, and we’ll just fuck them up. But, he never does anything to make the house better. He’s too busy. There’s too much solitaire to play.

That’s all he does when he’s home. After he does any routine with his animals, he’ll sit on the ipad or laptop and dick around. Or go out to smoke. Or just watch TV. Yet, in his mind, he’s carrying the world on his shoulders. He certainly makes it seem that way about his work. He always has stories about how his day was ruined by one of his coworkers messing something up. He would regale us at dinner about how he put so-and-so in his place, or how he put down someone for something trivial. It’s one reason I try to avoid having dinner with him.

When we go out to eat, he will always pick on my step-mom over something. She had her thyroid removed and takes some time to process some things sometimes. But, my father paints the picture that she’s retarded and he is such a better person now because he can tolerate waiting an extra second or two for her to respond.

Talking with him is impossible. There is no talking with him. He will talk to you. Often, down at you. Always with irrelevant tangents that add nothing to anything the conversation is about. He talks to hear himself talk. He talks how he thinks, and he thinks all the time because he is alone. And he is alone because he pushes everyone away from him.

He hates his mother, but they’re identical. Ok, not identical. She’s a racist bigot, but outside of that difference, they are exactly the same. And if I ever mentioned this fact, I guarantee WWIII, IV, and V would break out simultaneously under this roof. He has such bad mommy issues, it’s just sad. 

And there’s no arguing with him. There’s no way to convince him how much of an ass he is. If you fuck up playing Operation, you get a little buzzing noise. If you fuck up trying to tell my dad that maybe his opinion isn’t the absolute word of God, then congratulations! You just won a one-way ticket to him shitting in your soul. And believe me, he will not hesitate to use any trigger or emotional issue you have to manipulate you and put you down.

Every. Single. Thing. I have ever done wrong has been thrown back at me at some point. It might have been an hour after it happened. It might have been the next day. It might have been the next week. It might even sat silently in the back of his head for months or years until one day he sees something you’re doing and regurgitates it out of the blue and blindsides you, making you feel horrible when you otherwise could have been doing great.

That’s a pretty big staple of my life: constantly feeling terrible. I think self esteem is a myth thanks to my father. I was regularly built up to have the rug torn out from under me. His praise became the life-blood I lived for, because I was gas-lit so badly that only his word was representative of the truth.

And his truth pervaded everything. Anything I did online was followed. I was watched like a mouse to a hawk. Everything I did resulted in some comment or him bringing it up in the most awkward or embarrassing moment. No, doctor, I don’t know where the paranoia of my schizophrenia started.

But I’m done. I’m through living like this. I’m done with fear. I’m done feeling like a worthless piece of shit. I’m done feeling weak and unable to do anything. I will not let his negativity ruin me any longer.

Fuck fear. Fuck it harder than I want to be fucked (which is really hard, btw). I may have let it rule my life for so long, but I am stepping away from the nightmare of the past and walking towards my dreams. I forgive my father for everything he’s done, for it does me no good to hold onto a hot coal, but unless he changes, I cannot let him to continue to weigh me down. I am getting out of this house and I am beginning my life afresh, without the taint that has prevented me from radiating my authentic self.

She was abusive, neglectful, and manipulative my entire childhood... I moved in with my dad at 13 but the damage was already done. Was in and out of hospitals for mental health between 13 and 19. She was still a part of my life, and her proximity made it hard for me to see that most of not all of my issues have come from the way she treated me.

September 29th, 2016, she took off and ditched my father and I. She was living with us, strictly as a roommate. She got angry about the money she was paying toward bills, and took off in the middle of the day while my father and I were both out of the house. No warning. This was the third time in the last four years prior she pulled something like thay, and something in me just snapped. I cut her off completely. I was 21, almost 22.

I'm now almost 24. My mental health treatment is finally *helping* because I'm actually getting to the core of the issues since I'm no longer in her sphere of influence. I'm dating a wonderful man who plans to propose soon. Everything in my life is getting so much better. I have zero contact with anyone who would be able to give her any information whatsoever about me.

I don't want to reform a relationship with her. What I want is to rub it in her face how much better I've become. How quickly my life went uphill when I cut her off like a malignant tumor. I want to contact her just to say ""SEE! Look what I can do!"" I know this would be stupid, and I know I would never actually do it. But I am full of so much *anger* I don't know how to swallow it. I am almost 24 years old. I am an adult. But I want to throw everything in her face. I want to make a point by point list of her atrocities, and read it six inches from her face while she sobs, which she would because she is *always* the victim. I am so ANGRY and I just have no idea how to move past it. The sadness is gone, the desperation for the life I could have had if she was never in my life is fading. But the anger is still burning in me and it's so toxic, but I can't figure out how to take it away.

A few months before she took off, there was a moment where she was screaming about something or other, inches from my face, spitting poison. I just wanted her to shut the fuck up. I was just so done. I grabbed her forearm to push her away from me, something I have NEVER done before. But suddenly I couldn't let go. I felt my hand squeeze, but it felt like I wasn't controlling it. She saw it in my face, and she whipped her arm away. I've swear it's like an untapped rage appeared in that moment and hasn't gone away. That was the scariest moment of my life. She has always made me feel like a pathetic, scared little girl, who she could control with her bellowing screaming and in that moment I just snapped. I couldn't fucking stand it, I couldn't stand her screaming in my fucking face for one more second. I'm still grateful she pulled away, because I genuinely don't know what I would have ended up doing had she not. I was squeezing her arm hard, but I just wanted to break it in half.

I am so scared of the woman I was in that moment, but it still feels like she exists so much in me. That angry, broken person who wants to break my mother's face.

I just don't know how to make this anger go away.

Get it right, stop trying to justify your behavior. You were a deranged, controlling, bipolar mess of a mother & I, a scrawny 5-6 year old little girl who couldn’t defend herself - got the brunt of your violence and rage through beatings, humiliation, ridicule, intimidation, fear, and mocking. 

Let’s not sugar coat this by saying you were overprotective, you were a controlling, abusive mother. Let’s call it what it is. 

I would not need so much therapy if you were simply “overprotective” I would not hate myself and have to learn to love myself again -  if you were simply “overprotective” I would not have self esteem issues and depression if you were simply overprotective.

The problem is that they use my dependence of them as leverage against me and constantly put me down and invalidate me, to the point that I only realized how badly they've been treating me after a couple of therapy sessions with my mother made me see the situation from the outside.

I'm mentally ill and that's made it really difficult for me to make progress in terms of acting more independent, but they keep using that as an excuse to treat me like a child and punishing me for still living at home and taking longer to get through school. I can't disagree or be angry or have a different opinion or defend myself because ""you live under OUR roof you follow OUR rules"" and I'm powerless to do anything. I straight up asked my mother why they won't treat me with respect, and though she wouldn't say it directly, her answer basically implied that because I don't ""contribute"" to the family I still have to answer to them. 

It would be one thing if I had a plan and knew I was going to move out soon, but I'm still at a point where I'm living with them indefinitely, and I don't know how much longer I can take it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated"

&#x200B;

Last month I had a mental breakdown of sorts, culminating when my mother used one of my deepest regrets in an argument with me, and I broke down inside of my room and was basically dead for hours. To make a long story short: I (25/m), started to self harm again because of this. I know, I know, I'm pathetic for still living at home at this age, and I shouldn't complain about the way my parents treat me because of it. 

&#x200B;

Anyhow, I set up an appointment with a therapist about this: both the mental breakdown and the ensuing self-harm, and my mother insisted on coming along. My brother, who was taking me, saw no problem in it. Until I got called into the Therapist's office and she insisted on coming in with me. 

&#x200B;

When the therapist arrives my mother goes on for ten minutes about how horrible her life has been, how hard I've made her life, (I dropped out of college to take care of her after a surgery), and goes on to list all of her traumatic events and starts crying in the office. She sees the same therapist and had an appointment set for the next Monday, mind you. 

&#x200B;

Then she goes on to talk about my anger issues, and brings up that deep regret that she knows I have as some sort of justification to the therapist. How abusive her parents were, and how nobody at home listens to her. I couldn't get a word in edgewise, until, at the end of her tirade about her hard life she said, ""and he just  blew up yesterday and I don't know why,"" through her tears. 

&#x200B;

Ten minutes later and she finally leaves and I'm left to speak with the therapist, who then says I have anger problems and advises me on finding an anger management course. I couldn't tell them that I was suicidal. I tried to explain to them the self harm but they didn't listen. Now I can't go back because the therapist thinks I'm some sort of rage induced monster. 

&#x200B;

This was the event that made me question whether or not my mother may have something wrong with her. Please help me understand. Or is there something genuinely wrong with me for being upset with this? "

73,Just realizing how deep my issues of being raised by a narcissistic father really are.,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb12df048>,krajile,0,1,5,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536115577.0,9d2b6g,"I (39F) have to backtrack a little to start. Between the ages of 25-34 I was in an on-again off-again relationship with a guy who loved me. Or he said he did. And he acted like he did. But sometimes he'd be lying. Or would he be. Things wouldn't make sense, stories didn't add up. I was wrong of course. He loved me. He told me so. He bought me things. He took care of me when I was sick. But then whose number is that? I thought you said you were at X, how did you end up at Y? Why can you never answer my calls? Nothing made sense. He loved me, but his actions (some of them) were saying he didn't care and that he didn't respect me (but sometimes they did). I was so confused.

I'm 39 now. I was raised by a narcissistic father. I first identified his traits when I was in my early 20's and tried my best since then to not let it affect me. I still occasionally fell in his trap where I expected something of a father and was let down. Silly me. 

My mom died 3 years ago. My kind, caring, loving, (submissive) mom. My dad would stay in touch with me weekly; suggest we go for dinner, etc. This was crazy- I wouldn't ever hear from him when my mom was alive. Is he trying to make amends? Has he learned the value of family? Does he realize that he's my only parent and he's not going to let me down? I had high hopes. He was still a narcissist over dinner. Just talked about himself,  his work, etc. He wouldn't ask me how I was, how my new job was, if I was doing ok. I didn't expect it, really, so it was fine. He's alone now so I kinda feel sorry for him too.   
He went on vacation 3 months ago to his home country. A few weeks in he sent some pictures; I responded asking how everything was going, how the weather was, etc. No response. A few more weeks..pictures of a beach....a month later...another beach picture. No words. I stopped replying, aside from a ""nice beach"" once. Eventually he comes back and texts ""if you're free, come over for bbq"". I hadn't talked to my dad in months and he doesn't even start with ""hello"" or, crazier yet, ""how are you?"". 

I was in a bad mood at that moment so I drafted an angry, nasty message which my current bf with loving parents told me was too harsh. Fine, I changed it. I simply said ""Sorry dad, I can't come over. You haven't asked me how I am in 3 months. How do you think that make me feel? It makes me feel like you don't really care and only message me when you're bored."" His response? ""Well I tried sending a few messages but your responses were so short that it didn't really leave me any room to ask you anything"". 

Here's where we finally circle back to the story at the start of my post. I find myself feeling exactly what I felt in that relationship- but he loves me right? He cares. He shows he cares in some ways. But what about when he shows he doesn't care? Which is the truth? How do I know? I 100% do not trust my ability to recognize when somebody does or doesn't care about me. I have no idea what is real. That is the depth of damage caused by narcissistic parents, particularly fathers of daughters. But you all knew that."

I ended up taking a day trip with my older brother today & once I returned back home, all hell broke loose. My nMother went into my room, searched my bed, looked through an ENTIRE STACK of printed documents and decided to read all of them. Not all of them were filled out nor were about therapy but she decided to bring the forms to my dad and blame him for basically why I'm so fucked up as an adult now. She bombarded me as soon as I came home with waterworks about how this isn't how she envisioned my life & she did everything she could to make sure I was raised correctly. She went on and on about how she didn't mean to read ""the papers"" and since I just got home, I wasn't even sure what papers she was even talking about so I brushed it off. It wasn't until I talked to my dad and he told me that I need to make sure to ""keep my private documents out of sight"" because she'll go through them. I just don't understand why it's okay to have my privacy violated like this?  

&#x200B;

My dad is upset because I dared to write that my parents' relationship is dysfunctional & abusive on both sides (Apparently calling it domestic violence means that it's only physical and is only his fault???) & he's upset that I didn't talk to him about this first before ""writing it down & speaking to a stranger."" I'm just so drained and irritated by the whole entire thing. I'm currently taking a leave of absence from college due to my declining mental health & I realized some of my key personality traits are caused by my dysfunctional childhood -- thus why I mentioned the domestic violence & dysfunctional parental relationship. I finally convinced myself to go to therapy & I have been so anxious about this appointment so this is just the icing on the cake. I feel like I started a rift between me & my dad (bc ""I"" caused an argument b/w him & nMother) and somehow like I should be more mindful of others' feelings when all I wrote was my truth. I'm tired of having my boundaries violated and being disrespected but I don't know how to set boundaries bc I've never experienced what healthy boundaries look like.

My dad is the classic 'i make fun of your sorrows and then act offended when you confront me' type of  narcissist. The classic move of his is to make fun of you relentlessly and taunt you, then, when you give it back to him in the smallest way, he ""crumbles"" and acts super hurt and upset and will go on for days about it. 

So my wife and I have a four month old. My dad and my stepmom came over to visit. My wife usually has to help me mentally prepare when he comes over, and this time was no different. We agreed we were not going to deal with the intentionally hurtful way he treats me, the way he treats me more like a ""thing"" as opposed to a human being. 

So, we have a 4 month old and obviously we are incredibly busy with her, and obviously when you have a new baby you have to make many personal sacrifices; hobbies, interests and sometimes friends have to temporarily take a backseat. 

I've been running a Dungeons and Dragons group for several years, we meet every other week. It's a blast, and I enjoy it immensely, and because of that fact my ndad Hates it, and constantly ridicules me. 

During his visit just now, my stepmom (who is genuinely interested in my life) said enthusiasticly ""I was just telling someone about your d&d... How is it going"" 

""I had to stop,"" I said. ""I don't have time anymore.""

My stepmom started to respond, but my ndad cut in saying ""ahhhhh hhaaaaaa.... Ahhhhh hhaaaaaa....it's overrrrrrrr it's overrrrrrrr"" .... Then he starts slowly singing in a high pitched voice ""it's ovvvvvverrrrrrrr it's ovvvvvverrrrrrrr"" 

We all three just stare at him, perplexed. He keeps going. Finally after another 5-10 seconds my wife goes ""what is wrong with you?"" 

My ndad continues 'singing' ""it's ovvvvvverrrrrrrr"" 

My wife shouts over him ""no one thinks you're funny, we just think you're a rude ass"" 

He stop immediately. ""Oh please,"" he says, ""it's all in good fun"" 

""No it's not,"" my wife snaps back, ""you taking pleasure in your son not being to do something he enjoys isn't 'funny'"" 

""Is this like ... A sensitive issue or something?"" My ndad says. ""because you're acting really ...aggressive"" 

""No,"" I say, having courage now to speak up. ""It's just hilarious how happy you are about other people' misfortunes. What are you, in Jr high school?""

""Eat more food,"" my wife says to him. ""So you can keep your mouth shut ""

""Wow,"" he muttered. ""Just another person I have to add to the list of people I can't be myself around. Just aaaaaad it to the list. Just aaaaaad it to the list"" 

For the next hour of the visit he stayed in the kitchen, pouting, sighing, and silent.

I was calm and polite but asked how her (most recent and extremely hurtful) behaviour had made me feel.  Was planning to tell her not to contact me again. I've since learned that narcs cannot handle the word feelings. She swore at me, muttered some spiteful comment and hung up on me. That was over 4 years ago now and she has not contacted me since. I doubt she ever will. She was the 'ignoring' type of narc. I have no contact with any family. My question is, how do you cope with knowing that your parent can cut you out of their life without a backward turn as though you never existed. I feel such a huge sense of rejection. I know and understand she never loved me, nor my father who was a narc too, but I really struggle to make peace with how worthless it makes me feel everyday. I can't help feeling if my own parents can't love me, maybe I'm unlovable.

So this story is actually about a year old, but I remembered it the other day and decided to post it.

Now for a little backstory. I was 26, in-the-closet trans, depressed, and still entirely dependant on my parents for everything. I worked for my dad. I rented a room in my dad's rental house. My parents co-signed my loan on my car. I was securely under my thumb, and they used that to their advantage.

I had a bad habit of not getting out of bed when my alarm went off. Depression is a bitch. And this morning was like any other at this point. Laying in bed at 9AM, after I was supposed to be up at 7AM. Understandably, my dad is angry, and as he has a key to the rental, busts through my door. I really didn't wanna hear it, so I pretended to be asleep.

What followed was the longest, most painful 30 minutes of my life. Apparently I'm terrible at pretending to be asleep, or my dad is terrible at realizing I'm actually awake. He said he knew I was awake, but I still don't know if I believe him. I don't remember what he said, but a few things stuck out to me.

""Your friends are fake, they don't care about you.""

""You are not a transvestite."" (Of course I'm not, that's something different entirely. Validation, yay.)

""I declare death and destruction on those who would misled you."" (Did I mention my parents were religious?)

***""You need to cut these toxic people out of your life.""***

Oh boy, did I take that last bit to heart. I contacted all of my gaming friends to see if any of them had a place I could stay, saved up, bought a bus ticket, and three months later, at midnight, February 1st, I was on a bus travelling ten hours to Houston, with nothing but three suitcases containing my essentials.

Apparently when my dad told me to cut the toxic people out of my life, he didn't realize that was him and my mom. According to my sister, they are not doing as good.

Careful what you preach, I guess.

EDIT: I did not expect this to have the type of response it has. I should probably clarify a few things.

I left because I was being controlled by the things my parents had provided for me. They were holding them over my head. My dad is less to blame for this than my mom is, she was the one that held them over my head.

My dad is not nearly as bad as my mom, and is doing much better. They've both accepted me now, but back then, my entire family was emotionally abusive without realizing it, with the exception of my dad.

They aren't doing much better now, and I am. I don't know the specifics, except my mom cheated on my dad (for the third time, twice within the year). They're supposedly in divorce proceedings now and she's trying to get everything.

My dad had closed down his business that I was working at a few months before I left, and I was helping him flip houses, which he was trying to get into doing. He had taken out a lot of loans, and is most surely in a lot of debt now.

To be honest, if anyone is at fault here, it's my mom. She's narcissistic, controlling, and was basically using my dad, and still is, AFAIK."

81,nMom trying to get Medical Guardianship - Help (tw: entrapment),<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb7b29ac8>,svensk100,0,4,5,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536108031.0,9d1e36,"Hi RBN, 

I've posted here a few times about my nMom trying to get medical guardianship over me. I am extremely concerned with the direction the case has taken and am looking for advice.

Here is why I am concerned:

1. My attorney is saying my options are basically go to an eating disorder inpatient program or let nMom be my medical guardian (and she would force this too). 
2. nMom and I do not reside in the state where the guardianship case is filed.
3. I have made it clear to my court-appointed attorney that nMom is abusive through evidence such as emails she has sent and that she should not be a guardian of anyone.
4. I went to an assessment for an eating disorder in a state I have never resided in (or even visited before) with a doctor and psychiatrist nMom chose. It doesn't seem like my lawyer fought that. He admitted that nMom probably got to talk to the assessors prior to my assessments.The doctor was very manipulative and disrespectful (and tried to sell me her book - seems like she was trying to gain a new patient (and $$ for her) for her program). I questioned some of her assessments in the appointment and now she's written an assessment of me saying nMom should be allowed to give me psychiatric drugs. The report also tries to make me look bad for being late, even though the court gave me to incorrect address on its order. 
5. Assessment with psychiatrist included her wanting me to comment on my body with pictures taken by a FM relative within my private residence without my knowledge or consent. 
6. Court-appointed attorney told me this had no connection to the court forcing me to attend this assessment: A few weeks before the court ruled that I should go to these assessments, GC brother held me hostage in a canoe for 30+ minutes and would not take me back to shore (despite me screaming for help and pleading out loud to God for help) unless I agreed to go to the doctor who was later appointed by the court (I ""agreed"" but didn't go with him). This was also him holding me hostage with the intent to take me across state lines.

There are more details, this is where I am starting and trying to piece things together. Can anyone help?"
82,Trying to reason with a Narc....,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb6e2ceb8>,Headandfeet,0,2,5,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536111070.0,9d1rbt,"""Trying to reason with a narcissist when they feel criticized is like trying to pet a distressed lion when it’s backed into a corner.""

""

 “Vulnerability in self-esteem which makes narcissistic people very sensitive to ‘injury’ from criticism or defeat. Although they may not show it outwardly, criticism may haunt these individuals and may leave them feeling humiliated, degraded, hollow and empty. They react with disdain, rage, or defiant counterattack.

If you have an argument with a narcissist, they will blame you for making them angry. It’s almost impossible to get your point across because they won’t listen.

What they will do is say that  you criticized them, you’re trying to control them, you are wrong and you need to apologize.

They will then come back oozing charm and seduction, trying to seduce you back into their arms."""
83,I need help recognizing/coming to terms with abuse,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb186fcf8>,TangerineTrees_,0,2,2,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536128977.0,9d3rtd,"I'm doing this on my GF's reddit because I'm actually afraid I'm badmouthing too much about Ndad and such. Also afraid of retaliation if god forbid someone finds out who I am here.

I grew up criticized, everything I did was bad, or needed improvement,  or lacked initiative (because I didn't do exactly what they wanted how they wanted it without being asked)… never good enough except my grades (couldn't do better than perfect there I guess thankfully, but god damn whenever I got something less than 100+ percent). I remember always criticism, but very little physical contact. I learned that you can hurt and even break others with little more than your voice.

Not to say there wasn't physical contact. Mom once beat me so much with a belt that I had welts all over, all because I was afraid of being hit, so she just kept at it until finally I turned over and she whipped my ass, guess that one was on me. She denies that ever happened though, but certainly it never happened again.

I can't remember but I swear being thrown by the collar once as a child.

I made it through ok… I guess. Had depression, anxiety my whole life. Learned I had ASD recently too, guess I got good at hiding it, or maybe I was just too numb/afraid of making mistakes/isolated for anyone to notice. Parents don't believe the ASD, don't think Ndad even knows. For the depression they say ""happiness is a choice"" and for the anxiety they just want me to be a pothead like they seem to be (least now I know what that damn smell I could smell every week from their room is)

Made it to college, that came with its own challenges unrelated to the parents but nearly just as taxing. Where I finally got diagnosed and treatment started, but it didn't really do much…

Parents' marriage was falling apart long before it even started. Married after I and siblings were born, maybe eleven years before that fell apart.

Ma was being abused, we all were. Not innocent in the reason Ndad was mad at her, but he hurt her.  I stood up for her, got threatened for it. Tried to break my nose once with the threatening. Stood up too many times, got kicked out of the house. Was 19 at the time so I guess I deserved that too.

Been homeless ever since. Stayed at college because I had nowhere else to go, but never took a single class for the two years I was there homeless. Couldn't focus, almost ended it that summer when school was ending.

Everyone in the family now talks like the abuse is gone, but it'll never be gone. I have anger, and impulsivity. I lash out, and I learned how to have a venomous tongue. I'm afraid of it, and I've scared others, my GF included with it. I've hurt animals, and feel like I'm becoming a monster like he was.

I wish I could talk about what's happened after the ""eviction"", but it's too recent and identifiable. I'm limited/no contact with most of my family. Whenever I am around they act like nothing's happened, or they go back to their old ways, or both….

I'm alive because of my extended family. They're getting tired of supporting me though. That's an issue of itself, they say I need to stand on my own two feet, casually ignoring or just not caring about the fact I wasn't allowed to stand at all most of my life, and knocked down hard when I finally started to in college.

I never knew I was abused, everyone tells me that I am. I'm still unsure. Maybe I'm looking for validation as much as I'm looking for next steps. Maybe I just needed to talk to anyone who would listen.

TL:DR I feel like I've been abused but really don't know, I get told I was and there's certainly episodes but I can't see a pattern. Regardless I could use support because it didn't end well."
84,I remember reading books about abuse in the past and not making the connection that I am dealing with abuse myself.,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb0f79f28>,ray390,0,2,3,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536120064.0,9d2ugo,"I remember reading “A Child Called It” (this book in particular was really heart wrenching.  The abuse is quite extreme and made worse by the fact that it really happened), “Chinese Cinderella,” “The Little Princess,” “Matilda,” heck even “Harry Potter” just to name a few.  The abuse laid out in these are quite straightforward, and I remember reading them thinking, “I’d hate to be in their shoes. This is so terrible. These adults treating their child like that is awful. My parents wouldn’t do that.  My parents wouldn’t hurt me. My family is normal.”  It felt like the abuse didn’t apply to me, they were foreign to me. I was convinced my parents loved me and cared about me. 

But it’s like I didn’t see my own messed up situation when I was younger. It’s only now in my 20s that I am starting to see it and I’m just thinking how was I so blind to what was happening.  I never knew I was a victim. I couldn’t see it and even now I have a hard time digesting it and accepting the fact that these people are hurting me and treating me less than I deserve.  Perhaps with personality disorders like narcissism the hallmarks of traditional abuse can sometimes be missing and it’s harder to grasp. 

It’s so weird to think about. Our mind can really play tricks on us trying to deny our own reality. I’ve been reading about ill treatment yet couldn’t  see the one I was dealing with. 

But it’s right in front of my eyes and I still can’t quite grasp it. It’s there! It’s telling me my nparents did nothing to stop it when the GC tried to choke me.  It’s telling me my parents didn’t reprimand him when he physically abused me. The uneven treatment is right in front of my face and I still have a part of me in denial. 

DAE deal with this weird thing where you can’t fully grasp it? Like where you constantly doubt and still have hope that it’s not what it is?"
85,I'm wasting my life on these people,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb6e2c6a0>,pixie_led,0,5,10,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536096376.0,9czwaj,"I just got blown up at because I told my Nsister's child that a colleague of mine offered to help her to find work at an organisation. The response I got from my Nsister and Nmom was that I should have known she had applied there already, after which my Nmom proceeded to essentially suggest that I really didn't want to help my niece find work! When I got angry at the unfairness of the response I was receiving she then proceeded to
declare that I never loved her, that I think I'm better than everyone else because I have a career (Nmom has always been a housewife and my Nsis just never worked after her child was born), that ""if I really wanted to help"" -and then she stops short and laughs sarcastically, so I have no idea what else she expects me to do? 

So essentially I helped word, get signed and certified a recommendation for my Nsis's child, plus an offer of assistance to get employed - and that makes me the Devil! 

Two weeks ago I travelled with her to another city and took her around to an organisation where she was applying for work - but I'm the Devil!

And when, upset and emotional, I complain that Nsis daughter herself could at least speak up to defend me, seeing that I'm actually trying to help her - she haughtily responds ""I don't get involved in your issues"" and walks off.

And when, emotional and upset, I accuse my Nsis of treating me badly and being fucking ungrateful after all the years I have loved her child like my own - she spat at me twice.

What the fuck am I doing dealing with these people? What the fuck is my life about? Why does everything I sacrificed to build over the years mean nothing? Why am I falling apart?"

Another girl (20) I know says it's perfectly fine to cut off your parents if they are still toxic to your mental health and that I shouldn't feel guilty if I do. She as well had a narcissistic mother. 

I guess I just need more opinions from other people with similar situations. So how do you guys feel about it? Is it alright to cut off toxic parents or should we keep them in our lives simply because they are our parents? "

It really hurts and it keeps locking out randomly while I'm walking, at which moments it feels like it's about to bend the wrong way and snap. Today I wore brick red tights and due to the colour/denier you could really see the contours of my legs, and it turns out - eek - the kneecap that's been bothering me is significantly lower than the healthy one, and kind of twisted inwards. To use medical terminology, it looks fucked. 

Anyway, as soon as I noticed it I went and showed my eMum, who was shocked and agreed with me that it looks wrong. She called my nDad over and his response was:

a), 'what, do you have a bad knee do you?' (I have been mentioning this for **weeks**, and had specific conversations with him about it)

b) 'ha you're just like me then, my right calf is killing me today'

c) 'ah never mind' [end of conversation]

d) It is now 10ish hours later and he's LIMPING AROUND THE HOUSE and mentioning his alleged leg pain every five seconds. I was just showing mum a drawing and he came upstairs for no reason other than to clutch his leg, make some loud 'AH, OWWW' noises, and leave the room again. 

This is not a new pattern of behaviour. It doesn't matter what ailments we have in this house, if my dad hears about them he will instantly claim to be suffering from the same or similar symptoms, and he'll complain about them a lot louder than we do. Occasionally he will also blame us for them for good measure, usually picking whatever lifestyle choice of ours he doesn't like as the cause of the illness. This has actually caused me some issues I'm trying to work through where I blame myself for anything wrong with me and don't seek treatment. It's probably the underlying reason I didn't do anything about this knee for over a month. 

Anyone else's nparents react like this to illness or injury? Or if not, how do they act when you're ill?"

It's extremely painful for me to even remotely pay attention for long periods of time (to the point were I'll start crying) so ever since third grade I've kind of just given up on good grades. I'm in highschool now and when I DO try my hardest to apply myself, it still fails. I failed 3 out of 6 classes last year but the school district let one of them slide (it was PE) because there's a lot of health problems in my family. My parents have hounded me about doing homework and asking questions but I just can't do it. I genuinely don't think I'll ever pass highschool, even if I do extremely well on state mandated tests and have a decent vocabulary for my age. Past teachers have said that I had the potential to do great in school, but that's more of what my parents wanted to hear and not what I'm actually capable of doing.
I would love to get help for it but my mom hates going to the doctor's, even if it's a medical emergency because ""they're paid to say stuff"". She's also antivax (my dad isn't, however), and the only reason why I'm fully vaccinated is the laws in my state surrounding them and school. She doesn't think I should have a therapist either because ""I should be able to tell her everything"". So seeking. Mental help is out of the question.
I overheard her talking not even an hour ago that she doesn't like the school officials in my district, and the quality of the schools have gone down since my dad graduated in 82. (I actually agree with her on this). 
She's right, I hate to admit. The school officials are clumsy and messed up my schedule THREE TIMES, a math teacher got fired for having breakdowns in her class and 70% of her students failed, the guidance counselors purposely pick out the students who do well on state tests to make our statistics look higher, and right now I have FOUR teachers that would rather give us packets and group projects than actually teaching us.
I'm four weeks into the school year. I'm falling all of my classes. I hate the school I go to for the life of me, but what really got to me is how she wanted to homeschool me.
Um, no. She didn't go even up to a 9th grade education and thinks vaccines legitimately cause autism. If she homeschools me I'll be more stressed out than I already am. 
I do want out of that atrocious school system though. Maybe there's some way I can convince her that online school is a better option? Help me reddit.

I got my first positive pregnancy test on February 17th. I had my very first ultrasound done on March 9th, which showed I was measuring 6 weeks and 1 day. My mother has came with me to doctors appointments and the ultrasound tech said I am measuring perfect. Not ahead at all. My mother acts like she believes me, then goes behind my back and tells my grandmother she knows it isn't his, and it's guys A. This is literally impossible. Guy A is black, and guy B is white/Asian. I am biracial myself (black and white). I got a 4D ultrasound done, and she says the baby looks like the first guy and has ""black features"". I can't help this. I told her that yes, the ultrasound is somewhat how the baby is going to look, but of course his nose looks alittle bigger, and his features are more prominent because he is squished up inside the womb. She texted my grandmother today saying ""there's no way"", and ""to check her calander and look at the dates"". I am extremely offended she continues to go behind my back and say my child's father isn't his father, and then pretends to my face she knows it is his. Then, she told my grandmother to delete the messages because ""sometimes I look in her phone"".

The father and I are getting a DNA test and are no longer together, and I can't wait to show her the results that it is his. Even the doctors have said right infront of her that the baby is right on track, and my report says ""size is consistent with dates"". There's no way I conceived in the beginning of January and got a menstrual cycle on the 23rd. And doctors ultrasounds are not going to be this far off. I am so fed up of my mother going behind my back, saying these things. It's offensive, and I am to the point now I just want to leave her out of the rest of this pregnancy. Am I wrong for not wanting her in the delivery room? At this point, I just want to be in there alone. I am tired of the stress and constant ""back stabbing"" from my own family

It was mostly autoimmune and IBS-type things. I learned to hide my suffering (we all know what it’s like to be sick around N’s) so I wouldn’t be tormented anymore. For the most part, it worked. They had no clue when things were going on.

Things got REALLY bad in college as I was bedridden with full body pain, autoimmune symptoms, and unable to keep water down. Essentially, dying slowly. Hid that too.

I was finally diagnosed and treated for Endometriosis which was really severe and destroying my daily life since middle school. My period was always hell and suspected it, but I get confused when I read others’ experiences like “I couldn’t get out of bed,” “couldn’t go to school,” “debilitating,” etc. I’m like “What are you talking about?” 

Every time since starting, I was violently sick from both ends, screaming in pain, tunnel vision-ing, shaking, but could walk out of the bathroom as if I was absolutely fine. The pain was more manageable at school because I knew that I had to push through and learned how to stop myself from passing out. Maybe it’s because I had a distraction?

QUESTION: It was as if I could turn the pain “on and off.”  That I could be in as much pain as I “allowed” my body to be in. Now that I’ve had my Endo surgery and am not in as much pain, I am realizing just how bad it was and am horrified how ANYONE could hide THAT much unimaginable, incomprehensible pain as if nothing is happening. I can’t even wrap my brain around how much pain I was in. Now that I ""allow"" myself to feel it, I'm feeling it.

Literally what even?! Is this even a thing? Don’t know if it’s a trauma skill of dissociating (a useful one) or some amazing willpower. I had been practicing it since I was a child and still continue today. Obviously the need to be fine for the N’s would play a large part in this. But I think you can push yourself and dissociate through any pain if needed.

I had even written on it {Dear Granny I love you double. Love [me]}. That coloring page stayed on my wall from the time she died when I was maybe 10 or 11 til just recently when my Mom took everything off my walls to try and empty out my room because my Dad has turned it into his ‘workshop’ (No never mind the two sheds full of junk in the backyard.

That stopped me because of course I’m not allowed to have feelings in their house. Can’t feel sorry, sad, sick, sore, nothing.

I remember getting it back when she died and putting it on the wall right by my door so that I could remember those feelings when I saw it.

This has been something that although I knew she was an n, I didn't realize she had been doing this until recently. She really knows how to pull the wool over my eyes which makes me rage... But anyways... 

She recently told me she went through my brother's girlfriend's phone while she was here visiting for the first time. She looked through all of it, including messages between her and my brother, claiming she was worried she was going to break his heart.

My hubby and I organized a very small wedding, where we live, which is far away from both my family and his family. I knew that if I got married in my hometown, I’d have to endure a big fat 200-attendees wedding, which as an introvert is a fucking nightmare. Also, I hated the idea of having people over that don’t care about me, that I don’t care about, that I haven’t seen in 20 years, and that are probably just there to bitch about my dress or my hubby.

So we married far away. 50 people were invited, of course also my big fat family, but I employed every sneaky technique I knew to discourage them from coming (for instance, by sending the invites for my cousins to their parents... Subtle cultural stuff to make them feel unwelcome. Don’t judge me - I have 10 cousins and only get along with 5 of them).

My slightly-Nmum insisted to have my GCsis inlaws invited. Now, let me stress that *my sis is not married*. She has been in a long-term relationship with the guy (5 years) and I suddenly had to deal with these people ALL. THE. FUCKING. TIME. Christmas, Easter, summer holidays... You name it. Whenever my parents would come over to where me and my sis live, they would come over too, and I’d have to deal with these people.

So, when the time came, hubby and I were more than adamant that we did not want them to the wedding. Nope. They are 4 and for people who we’ve already had to meet more than we wanted, it was like throwing money out of the window.

But my mum insisted a lot, said “how shameful would be if you don’t”, that “she couldn’t have looked them in the eyes anymore” and so on. 

I caved. We caved. To this day, they were the only older people there besides my parents, my hubby’s parents, and two aunts.

Also, when I invited them, they said that they didn’t expect it and that they would have totally understood and it would have been totally fine if we hadn’t invited them.

So my question is: is that narc behavior to you?

I am coming out of the fog more and more myself and I am involving my hubby as we are planning to have a baby next year. Any resources or books you may recommend (I have only read *Will I ever be good enough?* so far) are greatly appreciated.

Edit: grammar"
98,"I called my Dad for insurance purposes, and used nmom a name and not “mom”",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb589d6a0>,ambann15,0,3,2,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536121347.0,9d2zfz,"He answered all my questions that I needed then asked what’s going on with my relationship with “your mom” he said you used her name, and I said well you probably know why. He said “well yeah it’s why we divorced. So it’s a personality difference that’s all you have to say. But she’s your Mom and you have to remember that.” I just said I don’t know how to healthily have boundaries with either of my sisters or her yet so I’m no contact. His moms a narcissist. He was the golden child, and I think maybe that mindset derived from there. 

He was always painted up as a bad guy by my Nmom, don’t get me wrong they both equally made their mistakes, but he didn’t deserve the amount of hatred spewed at him. We just followed along. Maybe over the years his empathy for her has changed. Or maybe it’s the same case as my GC older sis who said she couldn’t remember how bad nmom was because she hadn’t lived with her in so long.

Either way, it has filled me with guilt and has made me question no contact. But then flashes of my treatment call back. Things I have cut friends off for in the past. Maybe I’m too sensitive, but maybe I’m just done putting up with stuff. I don’t know. Just wanted to talk to someone about this."
99,Finally told a family member about what my mom became and admitted she caused my suicidal thoughts—not being lonely up here,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb5657fd0>,reallypetitebarista,0,7,131,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536039615.0,9csth4,"My Dad has a friend he’s known since high school, who is basically my uncle. His wife acts like my aunt, and his daughter a cousin. I had work all day today, knowing they love me, I asked if they were doing anything for Labor Day that I could invite myself to. They told me to get over there. (I moved 2 hours away from my immediate family, they’re the only “family” I’m close to visit up here)

In the evening I mentioned something my mother did that bothered me, and explained that’s why I was there, I was lonely and needed to see people I loved and trusted. She seemed concerned, and suddenly it all poured out. The jokes about my suicidal period, jokes about taking medication for my mental health, the demands of me in comparison to the GC, the emotional abuse, the physical abuse, how I once went 4 months without speaking to my mother.

And then, my aunt began to cry, and jumped up and hugged me, she said she knew it was bad, but she didn’t know what my mom was doing to me. That she was degrading me. 

And finally coming from a family member who knows my mom, and not a therapist. Who loves my mom, but believed me, IMMEDIATELY, was so relieving. She just held me while I grieved for my loss of supportive mother and parents as I reached my final years of maturity. She told me it wasn’t my fault, I didn’t do anything wrong, and that I didn’t deserve it, and that I didn’t owe it to them to visit them. 

I’m not crazy, and I got a mommy hug and support like I’ve never had in years. Although I’m still scared, I’m so glad I told. "
