One post per day. Seriously, don’t spam. 

SO bashing is not tolerated. Let me repeat that for those in the back, SO BASHING IS NOT TOLERATED. I speak for all of the mods when I say that it’s super annoying to open up modmail and find numerous reports on comments because people cannot/will not follow the rules. Telling OP to leave their SO and/or insulting the SO will receive a ban. 

Do not DM mods. We prefer that you message us through mod mail so that we can discuss everything together because we are a team. Attempts to triangulate the mods against each other will be met with a temp ban and we will laugh at you. 

Encourage, advise, and comfort, don't fear monger. We are a team of different thoughts, not one hive mind of terror. Fear mongering will earn a temp ban or a perma ban, depending on the severity. That’s up to the mod who handles the report or finds it. 

If you're offended that's your responsibility, not OPs. If you can’t say anything nice in a support group, don’t say anything at all. 

Don't word police. We look for poor attitudes and genuine prejudice, we do not try to fight the useless uphill battle of censorship through word policing. Obviously there's not a place for someone talking about ""daddy's cummies 💦,"" but if it's something MIL said we aren't stopping you from describing relevant information. If you are offended at something not directed specifically towards you that is your responsibility. Still, don't hesitate to hit report it you think it might be hate speech against a group no matter what language used.

We need to respect anonymity here. So no chasing users across various subs or linking to their profile after they’ve deleted their posts. 

/u/Made_you_read_penis should be worshipped as a God, and requires sacrifices of eggplant emojis to be send their way at every possible occasion.

/u/dietotaku needs BTS gifs to survive. 

/u/mysisteristrash is my bae. That’s all. 


We put a lot of time and effort into moderating this subreddit and it’s because we genuinely love what this community has become. Let’s all do our part in making r/JustNoMIL great again.

2,"MIL threatened grandparents rights, earned immediate NC",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb1bf8da0>,sequinsandpolkadots,0,217,1289,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536076939.0,9cwz36,"Longtime lurker, first time poster. (Yay?) 

DH and I have been married for almost six years, and MIL has been an issue since exactly two weeks before our wedding. Once she realized that we were definitely getting married, it's like a switch flipped. She has constantly disrespected our boundaries, acted like she's a perpetual victim, feels entitled to do whatever she wants, and treats us like crap. She has also made it clear that she believes I married DH for his money, even though I also work full-time. 

For six years, we've gone through these cycles with MIL where she attempts (pretends?) to behave for six to nine months. Then, she doesn't get her way regarding something trivial and has a full-on tantrum that involves her not speaking to us for about three months. Once she's ready to speak to us again, she and FIL start trying to guilt trip DH. The phone calls start. The passive-aggressive love-your-mother Facebook memes appear. That sort of thing. 

After the most recent cycle, DH and I agreed that we couldn't allow this continue, mostly for the sake of LO but also for our own sanity. I was ready to go NC immediately and be done with it. He wanted to have a Come-To-Jesus meeting to try to ""fix"" everything and see if we could work things out with MIL and FIL. Since this was very important to DH, I agreed but only if we didn't bring LO since I knew the situation had the potential to be volatile. 

It went very well, obviously - Sorry for spoiling the entire post in my title. I could write an entire post about our lovely conversation with them. So much WTF. (MIL believes that every thought that goes through her head and every word that comes out of her mouth is THE TRUTH. FIL enables, enables, enables.) The highlight was when she threated grandparents rights 10 minutes into the meeting. DH and I agreed going into the meeting that any threat of grandparents rights was an immediate NC. As soon as the threat was made, we ended the meeting and left. We are now NC with no potential for reconciliation. 

(Side note: Grandparents rights are non-existent in our state if the child's parents are married, not unfit parents and in agreement regarding not allowing their child to have a relationship with the grandparents. Grandparents rights only come into play if the parents are divorced/a parent dies or disappears, and even then, there are stipulations. However, MIL threated legal action involving our child, so we are taking this very seriously. Also, this doesn't mean they won't be able to find some attorney to take their money to attempt to make a case against us.) 

A nom for your llamas: This particular tantrum was caused when MIL posted a picture of LO on FB after explicitly being told not to post pictures of LO on FB, period. She stopped speaking to us because I had the audacity to call her out on FB. (I also reported the picture to Facebook.) During our meeting, she attempted to scold me for not calling her privately to ask her to remove the picture. I told her if someone disrespected a rule regarding MY child, I would call them out any way I pleased. (Direct quote from MIL: ""What's so special about your baby that his picture can't be on Facebook?"") She also had the gall to complain that she doesn't have any updated pictures of LO because DH and I haven't sent her any in three months. Not surprisingly, this isn't the first issue we've had with MIL and FB.

At this point, we have done/are doing the following:
1) got a call into the attorney to see if we need to take any action right now
2) blocked MIL/FIL on social media
3) blocked MIL/FIL phone numbers
4) installed a Ring doorbell
5) will be purchasing a few video surveillance cameras for our home
6) informed my parents who watch LO a few days/week so they are on alert
7) house is clean (and tends to stay that way, thanks to DH), pantry and refrigerator are stocked, and have started fully baby-proofing in the event of a surprise CPS visit.

Is there anything else you'd recommend doing? How over-the-top should we go with the babyproofing? (LO is crawling and pulls up on things, but he's supervised all of the time. At this point, we have cabinets with any cleaning chemicals locked down and outlets covered.) 

Anything we're not thinking of that we should be? "
3,The wedding dress,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb7e34fd0>,Boldrockwanders,0,91,1625,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536056358.0,9cuceu,"Hi all talking about projection queen (pq) which I was told also loosely relates to toilet roll in French (which I think is hilarious) has got me thinking about other stories to do with her. This takes place before the whole message cheating thing. 

This is the tale of the wedding dress, now to preface me and my dh are not traditional at all he helped me chose my wedding dress on line measure me and send off for it. When pq found out she started going on about tradition how it wasn't right (cry me a river). Dh asked if she paid for it, she replied no he responds with well you don't get a say, (I told you all he is awesome as hell).

Now we had travelled down once again to see them, and things were actually going okay between pq and me, I decided to throw her a bone and showed her my dress, now to me it's gorgeous fitted to the waist then kinda comes out like a skater skirt to just above the knee. She is umm and ahhing over it and actually being generally nice about it.

She then comes out with gem I have a simialr dress in pink I think I will wear it to your wedding, record scratch what, like hell you will. I didn't dear readers say anything in the moment I was shocked. Later on that evening me and dh where talking and I told him what his mum had said, needless to say he wasn't happy he went down stairs and asked me to follow him, he out right asked his mum what was said and the daft bint repeated word for word what she said to me, he played along and was like oh beautiful can I see it, and dear readers I'm ashamed I doubted my dh and was about to kill him, as she scampers off to get the dress he looks at me and says don't worry, at this point I'm still shooting him daggers.

She come down stairs with a dress that isn't like mine guys it was identical and when he looked at the tag it was from the same shop and everything and neon pink! He takes the dress pretending to inspect then looks her straight in the eye and says mum if you so much as entertain the thought of wearing this dress or turning up to my wedding in it you will not be welcome, you will look ridiculous in a neon pink dress the same dress my wife will be wearing, and I will tell everyone you ordered it specially for the wedding to match the bride (her image is her everything) and tell them we told you not to. She splutters out some excuses and says she won't wear it, the subject was left alone after that.

Upon returning home with my dh I'm unpacking and discover the dress my dh didn't fully trust her, so he stashed it so she had no access to it, she never mentioned the dress going missing and never as far as I know brought the subject up again."
4,The Time Republimom kicked me out and got mad at me for being outside,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb7e1ce80>,ThrowThatAssAwayYo,0,32,403,False,JUSTNOMIL,only sucks vegan dick,1536080389.0,9cxjba,"This story comes when I was still undiagnosed with my severe as shit ADHD and Republimom blamed my inability to focus on “laziness.” I dreaded going home every day because it meant hours of screaming. I was only thirteen and I decorated the area around my bed with a series of dates written on paper. Those were the dates that I wanted to kill myself of self-harm but didn’t. A thirteen-year-old shouldn’t have that. She should have a volleyball poster or a lipgloss-smudged Jonas brothers cardboard cutout (or whatever the kids are into these days).

​

Anyway, I got in the car with Republimom and she started doing her typical screaming and I did something I’d never done before: I greyrocked. I greyrocked as fuck. I just sat there and let the ADHD daydreams take me away.

​

We were MAYBE two minutes down the road when she pulls over and orders me out of the car and tells me to find my own way home. I gladly oblige. I mean, it’s maybe a five minute drive from my school to home, and the route is basically straight, left, driveway. It was along some busy sidewalk-less main roads but I could walk in the grass, no biggie.

​

Maybe 20 minutes goes by and I see Republimom’s black car appear again, and my heart fucking sinks. I’m about to be herded back into hell. She picks me up in the car, and is screaming at me again for walking along the major roads because “what would people think if they saw you walking home on the side of the road? They’d think I’m a bad mother!”

​

So it’s ok to kick your child out of a car and make them walk home alone, as long as no one looks down on you for it. K."
5,Was hoping I wouldn’t have anything to post for a while,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb6e52d30>,ohreallynowlinda,0,29,206,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536087435.0,9cylvd,"I am writing to you from home state as we have been here a few days now. I am the woman who’s MIL came in my room after I delivered and took my baby to another room and had me and the hospital staff freaking out for a while after I lost my infant daughter two years ago. 

So the current situation had us returning to home state unfortunately. My in laws live in a midwestern state that has had some awful weather recently. My FIL and BIL work construction and were driving in one of their work vehicles during a bad storm. Their truck was was hit head on by another large truck that had hydroplaned. The driver of the other truck was killed instantly and my FIL and BIL were severely injured. BIL we are not sure if he will recover from his injuries as he has not woken up since the accident and FIL is awake but had broken bones and a lacerated liver. He has had a couple surgeries so far to repair the damage. There might be more in the near future. 

Of course hearing this DH and I with our son flew to home state.  MIL is a hot mess. She is trying to stay together and not freak out but I don’t know if she is taking too many meds or not enough or just losing her freaking mind. She sits in the chair shaking and staring at either FIL or BIL depending on who’s room she is in then gets up and mutters to herself and cries.  I’m sure she is scared to death to lose her husband and her son but I don’t think she is anywhere close to normal. 

I have put aside my issues with her for the moment. I need to be here for DH because he has gone through so much recently. If BIL doesn’t make it DH is going to be lost. His brother is his best friend. We are scared. 

When we arrived at the hospital the first day I had brought son with us because one of DH’s cousins couldn’t get to us yet to pick him up to watch him. We knew it would be an awkward meeting but I wanted to see FIL and BIL too. I love them very much. MIL was waiting for us in the waiting room since we couldn’t take little man into the ICU.  She burst into tears seeing us and nearly toppled DH over with her hug. She looked like she didn’t know what to do with me so she said hello and waved. I’ll give it to her for not trying to jump on me too. I could tell she wanted to take the carrier from me because she wanted to hold little man but she stopped herself. 

She took DH in first then she took me into each of their rooms. FIL was doped up pretty well with a lot bruising but he smiled at me and squeezed my hand. BIL looked nothing like himself with all the tubes and wires. I cried and MIL rubbed my back like we were a normal family. After that cousin took the baby for a while and we talked about prognosis for both. The day after we got not good news on BIL about the swelling in his brain and responsiveness. MIL has now gone we think three days without really eating a whole and only napping here and there. I guess that is probably adding to her craziness. 

She did call at like 2 am last night as we have
Been staying at a friend’s home. She asked if she could see the baby for breakfast. DH told her to go back to sleep or whatever she was doing and don’t call at 2am.  He hung up and confronted her this morning about it.  She says she doesn’t remember calling. He said she looks like she hadn’t slept at all and is running on fumes. So who knows maybe she sleep dialed or something. Or she really is losing her mind. 

I really wish this bad shit would stop. Our little family needs some healing time. "
6,"Moisturizer Nazi got a taste of her own medicine, and DH is on my side again (update)",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb7cafcf8>,cindyxloowho,0,54,200,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536086928.0,9cyj9o,"(TL;DR of this whole ordeal: DH basically went full mama’s boy with JNMIL after she moved in with us and was letting her read my angry texts. They cracked a joke about my moisturizer choices and that was the last straw. DH promised to talk to her, but never did.)
Also, potato format cause I’m on mobile.

Thank you to everyone for your advice, it really helped me grow some hypothetical balls. 

As I stated in my last update, DH started seeing my point of view, for an entire night, before JNMIL sucked him back into his unhealthy sharing of our relationship problems. 
Since he’s off work on Saturdays, I formed a plan. A plan to give each of them a taste of their own medicine. First, I invited my cousin and sisters over without telling either of them. I made sure they came over when they both least expected it, bright and early.  When they showed up, I decided to let my sisters make breakfast. DH walks out and is visibly irritated. My sister asks if he wants some eggs and bacon, he says sure and sits down with us. Like clockwork, this is when JNMIL decides to join us as well. We’re all eating breakfast and my sisters and cousin bring up the fact that my daughter’s birthday is coming up soon. JNMIL says “I know, it really sucks that I have to visit my other son in (state) &amp; miss the party.” to which my cousin responds with “That sucks, OP’s  mom is planning the entire thing and even took off work that weekend to make sure it was perfect. I wish you could be here to see it.” 
Keep in mind, this is the same cousin i vented to about everything prior to this, so I was doing an internal victory scream when she said this.
JNMIL replies “I know, I just really want to be there for my son and see my newest grandbaby. She looks *just* like him.” 

After everyone’s done eating, cousin decides to try and bait JNMIL into talking bad about me in front of my sisters. She says “Isn’t it nice not having to cook breakfast?” I almost expected JNMIL to not say anything, then again, she wouldn’t be a JNMIL if she didn’t. 
She says “OP never makes breakfast like this cause she usually just gives the kids cereal, so yeah it is.” 
Bingo. 
My sisters darted their eyes at each other and my youngest sister says “Well, it *is* hard cooking for three kids as it is, let alone two adults on top of that.” 
JNMIL rebuttals with “I used to make a big  breakfast for my 5 children and my husband every morning when I didn’t work.” 
My middle sister starts picking up on what I was talking about and replies “Well, DH could always make his own breakfast if he wants a big meal, OP is the one with the kids all the time. It’s only fair.” 
JNMIL scrunches up her face and says “He shouldn’t have to, he works so she can stay home all day. I used to stay at home with my kids too and I still managed to get a warm breakfast made every morning until I started working again.” 
DH notices the tension rising and changes the subject by saying “What do you guys want to do today?”. My cousin says “We just wanted to visit for the day. OP has been telling me how lonely she’s been feeling, so we thought we’d come keep her company.” 
DH gives me a ‘wtf you told them?’ look. 
I ignore it. 
Skip to the evening, JNMIL asks what we want for dinner. 
Middle Sister decided to reply with “Isn’t OP gonna cook? You said she never makes big meals, you should let her cook for you.” 
JNMIL says “Well, she does cook but it’s usually just the same old stuff.” 
My youngest sister starts getting irritated, 
“Well, you don’t want her to cook, then you get mad at her for not cooking? That makes no sense!” 
I get a text from DH that says “Tell your sister to calm down, dude.” 
My inner smart ass jumped out and I tell my sister, “DH just texted me to tell you to calm down.” 
My cousin &amp; oldest sister are holding back chuckles now. 
Youngest sister is fully triggered at this point. 
She tells JNMIL, “You know what? I’m not gonna calm down, cause I don’t think you should putting OP down all the time. That’s my sister, and I’m not gonna let you talk about her that way without saying anything.” 
It gets quiet again, and my sisters and cousin get up to go outside to play on the trampoline with my kids. 
The doorbell rings and I realize DH ordered some pizzas. 
When I go to the door to get them, JNMIL sees me and loses it  “Are you seriously that vindictive that you’re gonna waste money on pizza when I *just* offered to cook dinner? Are you really *that* upset over what I said? I didn’t mean it that way, you need to get over yourself! All I said was that you didn’t know how to cook like me, it was supposed to be a joke!! You &amp; your family are being ridiculous!” 
I was left speechless and was about to start crying, when DH walks up and says “THAT IS ENOUGH MOM! I ORDERED THEM! LEAVE HER THE HELL ALONE ! WHY CAN’T YOU EVER JUST BE NICE TO HER? STOP!! YOU’RE PISSING ME OFF NOW!” 
JNMIL was obviously caught off guard, and she scoffs and replies “ Well, how was I supposed to know that? You know I don’t mean it like that! She’s allowed to bitch at you all the time, but I’m not allowed to tease her about one little thing? Do we all have to treat her like a baby now?” She looks and sees that I’m crying, rolls her eyes and sits down at the table. 
My sisters and cousin bring our kids back inside to eat, then pull me aside and ask what’s wrong. I tell them, and my sister storms into the kitchen and asks my children to go outside again for a minute. 
They leave, and she starts going in “YOU SHOULD BE THANKFUL THAT OP &amp; DH ARE EVEN LETTING YOU LIVE HERE! IF I WERE HER, I WOULD’VE KICKED YOU OUT WEEKS AGO!” 
JNMIL claps back with “SHE TREATS MY SON LIKE SHIT! SHES ALWAYS BITCHING AT HIM AND PUTTING HIM DOWN! MAYBE YOU SHOULD TALK TO HER, NOT ME!” 
At this point DH is visibly pissed, “OKAY! EVERYONE WHO DOESN’T LIVE HERE, LEAVE! NOW!” JNMIL puts on a smug smile, then DH says “YOU TOO MOM!”.  She packs a bag and has a cab take her to his sister’s house. 
JNMIL hasn’t talked to me since, but DH said she’s coming back tonight and wants to have a “civil” conversation with the both of us. 
I told him I wanted her out by the start of December and he said okay. 
Will post another update after this.

7,Please read. Emergency situation.,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb4767fd0>,texasbrownies,0,112,287,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536075779.0,9cws33,"My MIL has hit a new level of crazy today that is making me shake with fear. 

A little background, she has a conceal and carry. She has a history of mental illness. No I do NOT let her near our DD. She tried to forcefully grab my Dd from while arms while she was feeding. She tells me I'm ""stealing away her son"". This has been going on for two years. 

I'm pretty sure she just threatened me. I'm not sure if I should go to the police or if I'm over reacting? Her behavior is so unstable right now, she is all over the map. And I am freaking out. 


Text exchange:

MIL-""IF u want to keep demonizing me-keep it up""

Me-""Nothing wrong with help. It's when someone wants to take a title from you that is so great.  mother""

Me-""Get over the fact that I don't want you calling yourself mommy Mary. ""

Me-""Why is that so hard????""

MIL-""no""

Me-""Why can't you respect that??

Me-is that a threat? (Realizing what the heck I just read)

MIL-"" (name)- you are really crazy :-(""

Me- ""are you threatening me""

MIL-"" yes OH MY""

I'm trying to get a hold of my husband but he's working on a roof today so I can't reach him. I am shaking. I am mad and I am scared. I don't know how to get the whole conversation on here but it is like...I'm very scared. 

Should I go to the police? Wait for my husband? I can't think right now.

8,I Had to Go on Vacation to Find a MILITW,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb470bd30>,McDuchess,0,14,280,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536071239.0,9cw3ft,"Last week, we were in MA on vacation. Rather than spend a second day sweating through the Freedom Trail in the mid 90's temps, Husband and I drove up to Good Harbor beach in Gloucester. It's gorgeous, BTW. And there, in all her glory, I saw the MILITW.

I was lying on the beach, people watching, when she arrived. Directing her daughter and SIL, along with their adorable little boys, about 1 1/2 and 3, she plowed through the crowd till she found her spot, right at the water's edge. Another woman was sitting just behind where MILITW staked her claim, watching her son in the water. No matter. This was the MIL's territory now. So she took the woman's boogie board, picked it up and moved it so it would no longer encroach on her spot.

Her daughter spent the entire time we were there, smiling anxiously, except when talking to her kids. Then she looked sincere. Son in law, OTOH, spent the entire time as far away from her as humanly possible, scowling. He stopped when, again, interacting with his children, or when his BIL showed up and started treating him like a companion, not a servant. 

I got squicked out when the daughter needed sunscreen on her back, and her mother grabbed it and put it on her, rather than the husband. Daughter had the anxious smile plastered on her face the entire time. 

MIL took charge of the kids as much as she could, although, once FIL showed up, it was clear that both of them preferred him to his wife. The older son, especially, she tried to monopolize, but he was pretty adept at avoiding her and finding one of the other adults to interact with.

During the time we were there, there were no fireworks or theatrics. Just the typically ""I'm in charge of the world"" bullshit we see so often from JNs, and the uncomfortable responses, in varying fashion, from the people who are unfortunate enough to be associated with them. 

Me, I was more than happy to read my Kindle book on my phone, and take surreptitious visual snapshots of the bitch. Sunglasses are so very useful, aren't they?"
9,"First time mom, MIL can't handle ""no"".",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb4745e10>,GrimJelly,0,151,666,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536045574.0,9ctdh2,"This is my first post here, but I've spent hours reading all your posts! I've also read the rules about a hundred times, to make sure I don't mess anything up and get myself temp banned by accident, so if I do/say something wrong I honestly don't mean to. I'll also try to keep this as organized as I can, but a lot of this jumps around and relates to each other. 

This is also extremely long, and I'm sorry, but stick around if you want to experience my frustrations I have with my MIL. 

I'll preface this with some back story D(ear)F and I have only been together for just over 15 months. We also have a 4 month old son together (scandalous, I know). I met DF at work, we've worked together for going on 5 years, and always had kind of a ""bust your balls"" type of relationship. Keep in mind, that DF is a fairly socially anxious person, and I'm his first serious relationship. We're both in our twenties. I also used to volunteer with his mom, but didn't put two and two together until closer to us developing a romantic relationship. From the very first time I met MIL, volunteering with her, I thought she was a lovely woman. This continued for the first couple of months into our relationship. I now realize that the only reason I thought she was great was because she stayed at arm's length. 

My dad has always been very inclusive of DF. They have very similar interests, and a lot of the time when all of us are together I usually get left out of conversation (because I have no idea what they're talking about and therefore no input), and as annoying as that can get, it's really nice to see Dad being friends with the man I'm marrying. I truly feel like Dad has welcomed DF into the family with open arms. The same cannot be said for MIL. Within the first six months or so of being with DF, Dad had made every attempt to get to know him, be it having dinner with us, inviting him over for movie nights, taking us out to special events. DF even spent Christmas Eve (which is very important to my family) with us and got to partake in our Christmas Morning/day shenanigans. The only dinners I had ever had with the IL's was a birthday dinner for DF and a Christmas Eve dinner before heading to my family's get together. Keep in mind, by the time his birthday had rolled around we had been together for over 5 months. I was invited to one dinner, in a 5 month relationship.

By this point, I felt like his parents weren't being very welcoming of me. MIL was very strict on the ""no spending the night"" rule, even though he was an adult and paid them rent. She would text very late in the night ocassionally, asking when I was going home, when half the time she didn't even realize I was there to begin with. I eventually brought up to DF that I felt like they just didn't want to get to know me, and he responded by saying they just thought I was shy, and that's why I was never invited to come around. I guess that's in part DF's fault, because he could have just as easily said ""is it okay if I bring OP?"", but oh well. Up until this point I really didn't have any real issues with my MIL, other than feeling kind of alienated by her. 

That is until, we discovered I was pregnant VERY early in our relationship. DF, being the upstanding guy that he is, stepped up and immediately started filling his role of ""dad"". He was and continues to be an amazing father to our son. We told Dad fairly early on, shortly after my first sonogram, and he took it really well. I'm a young mom, I'm only 20, so I expected Dad to be disappointed or upset, especially when I had only been with DF for less than 4 months at this point. But he was excited instead! Great! DF decided that he wanted to wait a little while to tell his parents, because he feared they wouldn't take it as well as Dad did. Spoiler alert, he was right. 

Three weeks after we tell Dad, he finally works up the courage to tell his parents. He asks me if he can do it alone, because he doesn't want to subject me to a potential blow up from his mother (this should have been a BIG red flag). He spends several hours anxiously watching TV with them, texting me with promises of ""next commercial break"" when I started getting impatient. Eventually he spills the beans. His dad nervously laughed. His mom went to the sink, accidentally broke a mug, went out to have a smoke, came back in and told him I wasn't welcome around the house for a little while. THIS is where shit hits the fan. 

Over the course of the next couple weeks, MIL has taken it upon herself to try and convince DF that we shouldn't move in together. In her mind, DF should live at home with them, let me either get a place on my own or live with Dad and raise the baby pretty much by myself for the first two years, while DF ""saves money"" and goes to school. DF of course tells her no, but not in a direct enough way, leaving avenues open to try and convince him. She tells him that she would like to have a conversation with me to try and explain to me why moving in together is a bad idea. By this point pregnancy hormones are starting to take affect and I get irritable about this. I say I don't want a conversation, she needs to just accept that we're not doing it her way and comes to terms. Conveniently, a few days later she tells DF that she's changed her mind on the conversation bit, because I'm obviously stuck in my ways. 

Fast forward to October of last year, DF's birthday rolls around. And I'm finally invited to a family outing. I agree to go, as long as DF promises me that I won't be backed into a corner and reprimanded about my life decisions. I'm high stress, we've just had an ultrasound and walked back in the rain. I would like to have a relationship with his parents that don't involve me being treated like a child. He promises me that she's dropped it. We get to his parents' house, and sit down waiting for her to come in from outside. His dad comes in first, and to lighten the mood says ""don't worry, we're just going to have a good meal, no conversation!"". I breathe finally, and then enter MIL. The first thing out of her mouth is ""we need to have a conversation."". She continues to scold me, telling me that I'm not ready for this and I've made a difficult choice for myself, while I sit silently fuming. The rest of dinner goes off without a hitch. I don't see them for a prolonged period of time until Christmas. 

Between October and December, we have our anatomy scan. We find out that we're having a boy, and excitedly announce the gender and his name on our Facebook. A short while later, I find out MIL has taken my sonogram photo and posted it on her Facebook without asking. I'll admit, this bothered me. I feel like this was a very intimate thing for DF and I to share with family and close friends, and that we should have at least been asked. DF wasn't even tagged, so people were commenting asking if it was his or SIL's. I let this slide, and didn't even bring it up to DF because at least she was starting to get on board with being a grandma. 

Shortly after this we find out that there is potentially something wrong with our DS's heart. We had to see a cardiologist for another ultrasound. When DF mentioned this to her, she comforted him, never asking how I was doing, or offering me any kind of support. I truly felt like nothing but an incubator for a grandchild she didn't even want at first. Not long after we had the ultrasound and were told everything was fine she made an offhand remark about how she never had an ultrasounds with SIL and she was fine, and that unnecessary ultrasounds are bad for baby. 

Months go by, and nothing really significant happens. She does some weird things like offering to take pictures while I give birth (she's a terrible photographer and also that's super uncomfortable), getting upset when DF and I make it clear that no one is to be waiting at the hospital for us while I have him, asking to join us to a midwife appointment, and trying to plan a ""grandma shower"" for herself, but all in all the rest of my pregnancy went by without much issue. 

Fast forward to late April, DS is born, and has just been laid on my chest. DF and I spend some time getting to know him, and DF eventually asks if he can text our parents to announce his arrival. I agree as long as he lets everyone know to give us at least an hour before showing up, so we can have some bonding time. IL's show up within ten minutes. So I tell Dad he can go ahead and come see him too. This honestly doesn't bother me a whole bunch, because DS is the first and only grandchild. I understand it's very exciting. Things continue to go well until DS is four weeks old, with weekly visits to IL's. 

Up until this point MIL had made backhanded offers at babysitting, but had never worded it in a way of ""you can feel free to leave him with me if you ever need to"" and instead was always ""oh you just leave him with me. You don't need to take him to do [insert activity here]"". When we expressed that we were going to be taking him to the zoo eventually she added her two cents by saying ""you're not taking him to a zoo. They're awful."" And while I understand her views on them, don't tell me what to do with my own kid. 

When DS turns a month old, we finally let MIL have a crack at babysitting. Being a FTM I was extremely anxious and reluctant to leave my exclusively breastfed baby, so we agreed to let MIL and FIL watch him while DF and I napped upstairs. She asked us to bring our stroller for him, saying it's just to rock him if he gets fussy. I say okay, asking DF to make a note to her that I don't want him going on walks without me yet. We arrive at their house, DF reminds her as I had requested and she immediately gets CBF. 

""Oh, FIL isn't going to be happy. He just wants to take DS for a walk."" 

I reply very politely that I'm not ready yet, and I would prefer him to stay close by me. 

""I would never let anything happen to him!"" 

I meet her with a more solid ""no"". 

Later that evening, after I never ended up napping because I was anxious about her potentially ignoring my boundaries, she asks me if we can take DS to go meet her friend. Now, I'm a pretty easy going person, I like to think. But I just don't see any reason that my son would have to meet his Nana's friend at just a month old. She's a stranger to me, there are germs, and I'm not a fan of passing him around to be held by just whoever. DF agrees before I can say anything, but luckily plans fall through and he doesn't meet this woman. 

This, however, made me realize that she had most likely made plans to take DS to this woman's house while we stayed home, and when I said no and foiled her plans, she got upset and manipulative. The beginning of her second major offence. 

Fast forward another month, we've been told that we need to leave our apartment for two weeks or so while our landlord fixes a pretty major leak. MIL graciously offers us a bedroom, and we take it as Dad's house is small. Before we can leave, we need to move everything from one end of our house to the other end. DF works full-time, so I take on the job mostly by myself. Dad helps me a bit, but eventually has to leave. DS is being particularly difficult, and I'm running out of time, so I ask MIL to come watch him while I power away at it. She asks if she can take him for a walk, I reluctantly agree, as long is it doesn't stray too far out of my neighborhood, and he stays in his seat so he can hopefully nap. She takes him for a half hour walk, and when she gets back I notice his carseat straps aren't in the same spot I buckled him (I'm super anal about this). I ask if she had him out of the seat and she admits she has, claiming she needs her baby snuggles. She says she walked by aforementioned friends house just to show him off, never alluding to the fact that he had been held. She had been reminded on multiple occasions before not to pass DS off to random people, so she was well aware of this rule. Several hours later I'm tagged in a Facebook post of this woman I've never met holding my baby. I, again, let it slide after DF asks me too because I didn't explicitly warn her no visits before hand. 

Now my relationship with her has started to strain. I feel like my boundaries and rules are being thrown out the window as soon as I'm not around to enforce them, and this makes it difficult for me to trust her babysitting. DF convinces me not to bring anything up for his sake.

This is where we come to the big and current issue, and for anyone still reading, thank you very much! 

Recently, I've noticed that people are posting way too many pictures of DS on their social media, myself included. He was set as multiple people's cover and profile pictures, and being shared carelessly. I decided that I wasn't comfortable with this anymore, locked my own social media up very tightly, and asked everyone to please be mindful of their posting habits regarding DS. I shared an infographic about parents and relatives oversharing a child's life and the dangers it could pose, and just asked that everyone keep his safety in mind. I then made a promise to myself to not post him on social media nearly as often (and have mostly kept good on that). Everyone else received this request very well, I got some apologies that I didn't feel were necessary, as I wasn't really angry at anyone. MIL, the main culprit of this, however, ignored it. 

Later that week, we visited the IL's with DS, and I casually bring up over dinner the post I'd shared. I find a way to gently incorporate it into conversation so she doesn't feel like I'm attacking her. I am met with FIL saying ""if you're so scared of social media, you shouldn't be on it to begin with"". Now up until this point FIL is not the one I've had an issue with. He's been a pretty agreeable guy, so this statement throws me for a loop. I explain that I know each and every person on my social media, and that I also know that my privacy settings are very tight. MIL proceeds to throw a miniature fit, giving me attitude about how she has family that she likes to share with. DF is giving me that look, so I let the conversation fizzle out. MIL must have seen this as a surrender, as she pulls her phone out to snap some photos of DS. Fifteen minutes after we leave their house, these pictures are posted. 

At this point I'm irate. There's no other word to explain it. I have made my discomforts clear, asked that MIL be mindful, and was essentially told no, while she did the very thing I had just said no to right in front of me. I give DF a warning that I am no longer biting my tongue, and send her a message. I very politely explain that I'm not happy, that even if it seems silly to her, I am the mother to DS and my rules need to be respected. I offer to speak to her and find a compromise, but that she can't tell me no just because she doesn't agree. She leaves me on read, attempts to call DF, and when he doesn't answer her, messages me back saying along the lines of ""I'm sorry, but you're being ridiculous and I won't listen to you."" She tells me I'm being anxious for no reason and that we need to have a conversation face to face. My blood is now boiling and I can feel the silver tongue coming out, so for the betterment of everyone, I ignore her. The next morning once I've calmed down, I send her another message saying that I didn't think we needed to discuss this further, I was putting my foot down and that was that. 

She leaves me on read and again calls DF demanding he go over so she can grovel about this to him and tell him he needs to talk to me. For the next two weeks this same scenario happens again and again, with DF asking me to reach out and try to talk to her, MIL blatantly ignoring me, and then calling DF crying that I'm being unreasonable. Even SIL sent DF a text stating how disrespectful I was being by telling her no. I tried a total of three times to be polite and respectful and offer a conversation and was ignored each time. DF and I ended up fighting a lot about it, bringing us very close to a break up because he refused to also put his foot down and tell her she needed to listen to me, and instead tried to play a neutral field. In this time MIL continues taking photos from my page and posting them on her own, including works from an aspiring photographer friend of mine, which she had cropped me out of (which aside from just being petty, she had discredited the photographer's work). She tries multiple times to get DF to bring DS over without me, and otherwise just ignores my existence. 

Finally things seem to calm down, DF begs me to forget about it, saying that MIL will be nervous to go against my wishes now because I've made such a stink about this. I changed my settings so she could no longer see any of my posts and agree to go to dinner so she can see DS. A few days after this, I post DS's 4 month sticker photo (yes, I'm that mom) on Instagram.  Within half an hour she has somehow managed to get the picture and post it herself. I'm not sure how as she doesn't have instagram and DF didn't send it to her. My best bet is SIL, who was following me, screenshotted it and sent it to her. 

Now, this probably would not have bothered me IF she had not fought me so hard on the issue before. Throughout this whole thing I've realized that she takes the ""proud grandma"" thing way too far, and is really just using DS as a way to garner attention for herself. I refuse to let my child be a showboat, and obviously I have not gotten through to her, so I message her one last time, this time less than nice. I very bluntly tell her she needs to stop, she's been told multiple times, and this is non negotiable. She flat out tells me I'm being silly and controlling, that I'm too much to handle and that she won't be stopping. That I just need to trust her. I respond with ""how can I trust you if you can't even respect a simple boundary?"" And I'm left on read. She then shares a very obvious post about me on Facebook (keep in mind this is a full grown adult woman), and when I make a comment on it, I am promptly deleted all together. 

Cue more fighting with DF, feeling like I'm on my own in this whole thing, threats of leaving, and he finally sees how serious I am. Agrees to talk to her. He goes for a visit by himself, but the visit is crashed by SIL, so he arranges another visit to clear this up. That was today. 

He sends a text this morning that very clearly states that from now on she doesn't get to say no to me when it involves DS. I need to be listened to, and that is that. He says we'll be coming for a visit today like she wanted, but that there was to be no arguing her case, this was the end of it and she needed to accept that or she would not be seeing DS for a long time. She calls him fighting it. 

During this phone call she manipulates him into making the decision to uninvite me so that they can discuss this further. She tells him she'll be awkward and uncomfortable until this is sorted out and doesn't want to be in that position. No, no. She wants me to not be around so she can try to convince DF that I'm wrong. DF tells me this and says he is taking DS without me. Another fight ensues, because I feel like this is just giving her what she wants. It ends when I agree to let DS go under the pretense that DF promises me that he will be firm and tell her she needs to stop. He was only going to be gone for an hour or so to have a conversation with her. An hour turned into two and a half, with them going out for dinner. 

When DF got home, he promised me everything was done. She had said some things but eventually agreed because she realized she wouldn't get to see DS as frequently. 

I honestly really do not feel like this whole thing is over though and I'm worried about her trying to take legal action against it now. This woman very obviously cannot take no for an answer, and I wouldn't put something like that past her. And at the end of this whole thing, it isn't even about the pictures anymore. It's about the fact that I asked a very simple rule be followed, and it turned into an almost month long battle just because she didn't agree. 

To everyone who reads this whole thing, I really appreciate it! It's been an uphill battle with her and I haven't had many resources to get it off my chest so it feels really good to let all the pent up frustrations out somewhere. 

TL;DR- Crazy MIL is told she isn't allowed to do something regarding DS anymore and throws a month long shit fit about it, pretending I don't exist all while behaving like a child who's had her favorite toy taken away.

10,Langauge Barrier *almost* messed up DH's meds,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfacef2860>,floweryscientist,0,11,130,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536076675.0,9cwxcp,"Hi all!

I just wanted to start this post off by saying thank you for your advice on the last one. As many of you said, DH does not have to be involved in his Aunt's estate and we are very grateful.

Now onto some llama drama from about a month ago! Language Barrier (LB) has been told by many doctors to lose weight. And every time she refuses, stating that they have a distorted sense of what is healthy. Guys, when she makes stir-fry for her family of 3 so uses 4 clubhouse stir-fry packages. Lawd. This is relevant I promise!

So it turns out that LB became close friends with one of the French secretaries when DH was still a teenager in the hospital. Even better -MIL called her last month to talk. Just to confirm - I am married to DH and he has changed his POA/NOK to me. LB has zero permissions to contact any of his healthcare team. But apparently this secretary wasn't clear on this. So she and LB are talking and then she remembers, oh wait, the doctor asked me to call DH and ask for his current weight (since his bloodwork showed his med levels to be low they wanted to see if it was weight related). So what does this woman do? She asks LB because she can't speak English very well and surely LB would know her own son's weight.

But remember, LB doesn't understand that her normal is actually overweight and such, so she greatly over estimates DH's weight. The secretary writes it down and they both go on their way. At approximately 8 am the next day DH gets a very serious call from his healthcare team. They need to speak with him asap. We are panicking. We know the bloodwork is abnormal. DH calls and they tell him through broken English that his meds need increased immediately. He will need to come to the hospital 6 hours away and be monitored because the increase could cause kidney failure. That is a lot to absorb. But DH is medically saavy and asks them why. They tell him that his medication dosages are not in line with his weight. And then it goes like this:

DH: My weight? I never told you my weight and nobody here was weighed me recently. (saying this while walking over to the bathroom scale to weigh himself)

Receptionist: Yes weight. We got weight on (yesterday) over the phone.

DH: You didn't call me yesterday. You must have somebody else.

Receptionist: No, you are (full DH name and date of birth). 

DH: Yes but nobody has called me or weighed me. What was the weight?

Receptionist: (reads out weight)

DH: well I just weighed myself here and I am (actual weight).

The receptionist proceeded to be confused (bilingual hospital my ass) and had to transfer DH several times. 

Upon hearing this one of DH's doctors became frustrated and called DH. This doctor is mainly English and listened while DH explained what had happened. The doctor then contacted some internal hospital people and they launched an investigation. DH's weight was fine and the bloodwork returned to normal with no intervention thank heavens.

Its been a while and the investigation results just came back. They found the phone number and traced it to LB. The secretary has been fired for a breach in confidentially and DH was sent an official apology. 

Side note: many of you have asked why we don't transfer to an English hospital. We have tried many times. There are none close by. And the French hospital refuses to transfer DH because of the distance thing, but we suspect it is because he is involved in much of their research which = $$$$ for them. We have had friends who work in medicine actually find papers published by the hospital and DH's doctors using his health data (anonymously of course). Also, all his health records are in French and we would have to pay big bucks for them to be translated. 

Update: LB denies it all. She says she would never do anything like that. We have been trying to password protect his healthcare info but apparently French hospital doesn't do that. Any ideas?"
11,"At 16 weeks pregnant, I was attacked by my In-laws. Both myself and my daughters lives put in danger. Now my husband wants us to have a relationship with them again. What should I do?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb4483f98>,sammydawn15,0,386,2633,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536016994.0,9cq9ve,"(I posted this a couple days ago in the relationship advice page. Recieved a lot of good advice, but multiple people said I should post here too. Just had to wait until the weekend was over because I havent decided yet if I want to share this with my husband, and I would like to reply to as many comments as I can.) 

Bare with me, as this is my first post and could end up being very long to provide all the info.. now that I've finished typing out the post, it is very long, so sorry! I didnt want to leave anything out 

The incident/backstory:
Back in April of this year, my husband[23], my daughter[2], and myself[23] were visiting with his parents at their house. My in laws went against our request that they not give our daughter Slim Jim's. By the time the conflict started, she had already had 3. I was fed up with them not listening, so I picked up my daughter and demanded to my husband that we leave. He and I exchanged a few words. As I was getting my shoes on, my father-in-law picked up my daughter and walked off into the living room with her. While holding her he started yelling at me. I approached him and demanded that he give me my daughter so I could leave. He refused. I reached out for her and he turned away. Again refusing to give me my child. I reached around him to try to get her. He turned his back to me and kicked me in my lower stomach, so hard it caused me to pee on myself, knowing that I was 16 weeks pregnant at this time. At this point I was completely terrified. I got up and begged them to give me my daughter so I could leave. He handed her to my mother-in-law. I tried to get her from MIL but she was squeezing her so tightly that I was afraid of hurting my daughter if I forced her out of MILs grip. She shoved me back and FIL grabbed me and slung me down into the recliner, then began choking me. My husband pushed him off of me. I got up and grabbed my cell phone, attempting to call 911. FIL hit me in the face and took my cell. I ran into the kitchen to try and use their house phone to call 911. He chased me down and took that phone, destroyed it. I ran back and pled for MIL to give me my daughter. She refused. At this point I saw FIL throw my phone outside into the yard. I went after it to try and find it so I could call the police, but I couldnt. They locked me out of the house. I waited for what felt like forever for my husband to finally come out with my daughter. We left. I called the police. DVPs were filed, and charges pressed. 

Fast forward to now, I ended up agreeing to drop dvps and charges because they had charges filed on us too and said if I dropped mine they would drop theirs. (Small town-they had every in with the justice system in their county). There were many reasons I agreed to drop everything, the expenses of legal aid, the mental toll, the endless stress it would have caused me during my already high-risk pregnancy, and my main reasoning to protect my husband from possibly having domestic battery conviction, although he did nothing, his mother had him arrested.  I agreed to drop the charges under the promise and understanding from my husband that our family was going to cut ties with my in-laws and I would not have to worry about myself or my children being around them ever again. 

It's been about four months since this happened and only about one month since all the legal processes concluded. I'm currently 36 healthy weeks pregnant with my second daughter. My 2 year old has seeming recovered from the trauma pretty well, but still has obvious anxieties over loud talking or physical contact-even play fighting. 

The problem at hand:
Recently my husband has begun speaking to his parents again and visiting them as well. They are sending gifts for my children and offering help with groceries, bills, etc. Even though it's not what we agreed on, I've tried to be as understanding as I can be because they are his parents. So we fought and fought over it, and I finally agreed that yes he could speak to them if that was what he needed to get us to a point where it wasnt going to ruin our marriage. A week or two passes and we start to fight over our children being around them. I dont think they deserve to have my children in their lives ever. He wants our girls to have a significant relationship with them. Eventually I agree that yes IN TIME, and I specified that it would not be within the next year, as I need time to heal from what happened, I would allow our daughters to spend time with them in public settings only, never in their private home, under my supervision. This was agreed upon. Another short amount of time has passed by and hes already asking to take our 2 year old to their house to visit them. Hes made comments about taking our yet to be born daughter to see them too.

What I need help/advice with:
I've given as much as I can mentally handle, any more and it would be completely unfair to what I need and what I think is best for our children and their safety.. So I've refused to budge anymore. Though things are at a cooldown phase right now, I'm afraid that this will eventually turn into another month of misery and fighting or longer because I just can not give in anymore. I dont want to lose my husband.. I dont want my marriage to fall apart because I wont give in to what he wants again. Is there anything I could do to make this work? Is there any way I can show him that I've done enough? How can I fix this? Is there a way I can protect my children from these people and save my marriage? Am I in the wrong? Have I done enough? 

Thanks to anyone who has made it through the whole post. Any and all advice or input is welcomed, rather you agree with me or not. I just want to understand what I need to do or what I could do to make this easier on my family and still keep my children safe. I dont really have anyone to talk to about this. Thanks for listening!

This story has to deal with MIL, SIL, and DD. 

Alittle back story- I have bipolar disorder and have been struggling with depression and manic episodes since I was a teenager but it’s been getting worse since DD was born 2 years ago. With that being said I’m checking myself into a partial hospitalization program today. I set up this appointment on Friday and MIL knew about it. 

I am a stay at home mom who uses MIL for childcare only when I have appointments and she is ok with this. I hate having her watch my daughter because she is to put it nicely, EVIL!!  Well anywho, MIL agreed to watch DD while I go to my intake appointment. 

This morning I text MIL to ask if she wanted to come to my house or if she wanted me to bring DD to her house. She says her house and I agree that’s fine, although I like DD to stay home.  (MIL is a hoarder and her house is busting at the seems with junk) 

About an hour later she calls me. SIL needs to go to the walk in clinic so she won’t be able to watch DD because she has to go with her. I’m thinking SIL broke a limb or something is terribly wrong. Nope, she had a cold sore in her nose. And MIL has to go with? Why WHO THE F KNOWS!!!

Now my SIL is damn near 30.... and she does not go to a single drs appointment without dear MIL.  Some appts I can understand, like for upcoming surgeries or what not. SIL is a healthy and functioning adult. I just don’t get why she has to have dear MIL go with to every. Single. Appointment. She lives with her boyfriend and clams she’s an independent women. 

Anyways back to the story; I kept my mouth shut because MIL is like i said a demon. I don’t want to start a war between the family because there is enough of those. With an hour before my appointment I was scrambling to find a sitter.  Thankfully my dad is on vacation and is willing to take DD for a few hours on a day he was supposed to go boating. 

Sorry for the rant, I am just fuming. This isn’t the first time this has happened either. When I did work MIL would call me 5 mins before she  as due to arrive to watch DD and say SIL needed this or that and she couldn’t watch DD. I have looked into daycares and nanny’s for the those wondering why I didn’t do that. I live in a very rural area with no in home daycares or nannies willing to travel to my small town for the amount I was able to afford.

13,Just answer the damn phone!,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb439a1d0>,Castawaycoffeepot,0,37,71,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536084725.0,9cy7vs,"I saw a comment on a r/aww post that reminded me of this incident. It happened not too long ago, may a week/week and a half. 

We were staying with my in laws while we were finding a house. (We found one and are out of there!!!) My youngest son is in the stage of “talking” on the phone. He has an old Motorola flip phone that has been past down from both of his older brothers to play with. One of his favorite things to do is go around to everyone in the house and telling them “for you!” It’s adorable and easy to play. You take the phone, say ‘thank you’ to youngest son and pretend to talk on the phone for a few seconds before handing it back! Then youngest son takes the phone and runs off to the next person!

But this wouldn’t be posted here if my MIL took the time to fuel his imagination. Nope. MIL looks at the phone with a sneer and says “I’m not taking that.” Then walks away. Poor little guy didn’t know what to do. So he tries again to hand it to her. My MIL takes it this time, but instead of ‘answering’ it she flips it closed and puts it on a counter where youngest son can’t reach.

Luckily the little guy has an awesome older sister who saw the whole thing go down. She takes the the phone and pretends to answer it before giving it back to her baby brother. 

I know that this is a mild story compared to others but I still wanna shake the bitch for not playing along. The kid isn’t even 2 yet! It takes 30 seconds out of your life to make him happy, just answer the damn phone!


Edit: Had to change youngest son’s name to comply with the mods. Oops!! 😬"
14,Comptroller and Flu Shots,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb438bc50>,razsnazz,0,37,158,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536067438.0,9cvkac,"It's been a while since I've posted here. My MIL is the one who, when left alone for 20 min, ""cleaned"" our house, found mail regarding old financial issues, and told me I needed an intervention. I've been living the life of a stay at home mom since the late spring and cooking this bun in my oven. The summer has been interesting with Comptroller and FIL, but mostly BEC and raging pregnancy hormones. This tale from the weekend, however, has me seeing red and I needed a place to vent. It'll get long because I'm too wordy haha.

Bit of background: Hubs considers himself the lost child while BIL (who is single and childfree) is most definitely the Golden Child. So much so, MIL thinks BIL can't do anything without her ""help"" and ""guidance"" and will bend over backwards to make him happy, even when he doesn't want it. BIL is a nice guy and accepts help when he needs it, but she can't let go of the fact that her nearly 40 year old son is capable of being an adult.

It's no secret here that I'm pregnant, YAY! LO2 is due early November. This means lots of newborn fun for the holiday season but also LO2 will be too little for the flu shot. We typically have huge get togethers for the holidays with friends and family (30 people for Christmas last year), so I have been telling everyone they must have their flu shots if they want to come over for any holiday celebration. Otherwise, they will have to wait until after flu season to meet LO2. We have had some pushback. Hubs' friends have made comments about the shot not working, my brother sounded extremely uncomfortable with being mandated to have a shot, and BIL flat out refused. The ILs and my mom are on board with it.


While visiting Comptroller, she asks if LO1 has had the measles shot. Yes, we are up to date on everything. She starts talking about how bad measles are and what she went through when she caught them as a child which leads to shots in general. I felt this was a good time to remind her that BIL is against the flu shot and we won't be able to do Thanksgiving with him.  FIL had said when we first told them that BIL will just have to miss out, his choice. But Comptroller...does not feel the same. Some points she made plus commentary:

This will be the first year in X years FIL is off for Thanksgiving!  (But BIL works and may not even show up the day of. We usually celebrate with him on his day off, we're not doing that this year because of his no flu shot).

I guess we'll just have to have seperate holidays like we did with Aunt and her family (Aunt is manic, super controlling, and demeaning, thanks for comparing me to her. Hubs said that was absolutely not true. They never celebrated holidays, together or seperate, because Aunt was too busy with other things due to her manic phases).

How can Hubs not see BIL for 6 months?! I don't see that happening! (Hubs responded and said *he* can visit BIL, but BIL can't see LO2. We're not cutting him out of our lives, but he is delaying his introduction to our new squish).

(Also, I would like to note that my own brother has been told he is not allowed over for holiday dinners or to meet LO2 if he does not want to get the flu shot. I made sure to mention that it's both brothers whenever she brought it up so she knows we're not unfairly picking on BIL).

I can't remember the rest, but it was basically guilt tripping us for sticking to No Flu Shot = No Holidays. When we got home, Hubs was mad. Said that this is BIL's choice, not ours, and if she wants to pressure someone, it should be him. We had a very rough first month with LO1's health and nearly ended up in ER because we weren't strict with visitors and I refuse to live that again. We agreed we'd like to host Thanksgiving at our house because we both can see MIL making BIL come over against our wishes and his (he would much rather stay home, but guuuuuilt trips galore will make him come). Plus, it would be beneficial with a few weeks old newborn since we'll have a feeding and sleeping set up whereas Comptroller will not. If we can't, then we will just show up for the eating and head back home since we'll have a newborn that really can't be away from the house too long (babies are wonderful excuses to stay home). And if BIL does show, Hubs said we will leave immediately. I'm confident in our plan to handle the situation, I'm just PISSED she is putting us in it and would rather put the health of our newborn over the comfort of BIL or her image of a Faaaaaaamily holiday dinner.

My dear husband (DH) did not see it when he was in the FOG, but sure as sunshine does now.

​

So, a little after we move out of her rental house, she fires her son, my DH, from his job at the family business.  Because she can.  She does this thinking that we will be destitute.  We will have to come crawling back!  No, Morlock, you just lost your last bit of leverage.  We were, and still are, financially fine.  Freedom is sweet, y'all.

​

Any time I read a story here that starts out with something to the effect of living under your MIL's roof, I want to shout, ""Ahh! GET OUT!"" as if I could reach the protagonist in a horror movie.  Either that or ""Molly, you in danger, girl"" like Whoopi Goldberg in Ghost."
16,"Meet Jamie, the MIL who uses teenage-tv-show logic to break us up.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfacef2c50>,Mucheng,0,11,39,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536090785.0,9cz37h,"Hello! I'm really bad with nicknames on this so I'm just going to call my MIL Jamie.

Yeah, the in-laws are both pretty awful and I don't think it will ever change. I'll start out with backstory: my husband's parents had him as teenagers and were divorced before he could remember, and both parents remarried. His father and his step-mother are the awesome in-laws who live states away. I consider his father's new wife to be my actual mother-in-law, because she actually treats me like someone in the family. His biological mother who he grew up with is the fucking devil, that would be Jamie. Jamie had another kid with step-father-in-law when my husband was 10, so the sister-in-law is now a teenager with quite the mouth on her. Since she was born, my husband was put on a back burner. Jamie would cry and tell my husband that she hated him for looking just like his father. She would manipulate him into not going to see his father even though legally he was supposed to have custody during breaks.

In the beginning of our relationship, she tried her damndest to get us to break up. It was almost teenage-tv-show comical the things she would do. He was 19 when we started dating and they would monitor his texts between the two of us (He wasn't even on their phone plan...they wouldn't let him be on the phone plan since he got a phone, he had to pay for it himself. Even when he was 13, he was paying for his own phone using allowance and money given from grandparents). She would then use the information against us. At one point, she took some of the sexting we had back and forth and video footage of in-home security cameras (more like a spy cam) of me (a consenting adult) giving him (another consenting adult) a blow job. She took the ""proof"" over to my parents house (my father is a preacher/deacon and both my parents are highly religious) so that my father would be pissed and force us to break up. Unannounced to my parents' home. She then asked my parents to make me leave because she ""did not want me to defend myself"". My parents told her she wasn't allowed to come into their house uninvited and then boss their child around, but I was still trying to be on her good terms and excused myself. Despite her efforts of showing the videos and appealing to my father's religious side, he just called her a child, told her that it was obvious they were teenagers when they had my husband and that they would eventually learn to let go once they grew up. He then told them ""I taught my daughter what I wanted to teach her, and she is 18 and makes her own decisions. Think twice before turning me against my daughter. Now if you excuse me, your son and I are going to go see a movie. We have been excited about this for weeks.""

Jamie then invited my parents over one day and my parents just left. They didn't really stay long nor did they tell me the things they said. My mom said that she was basically saying I wasn't good enough for her son (you know, the one she mistreated while he grew up). My parents cut ties with them immediately, saying they made them uncomfortable.

When none of these attempts worked, Jamie kicked her son out to live with his dad. This meant he had to stop going to college (despite him doing well and having full-ride scholarships, he still wasn't able to afford dorm-life without her help) and he had to get away from me. We spent a year apart before we decided I would go live with him over there. She called and told him I was manipulative and abusive, my love was conditional, that it wasn't worth having someone mentally broken who had been in a mental hospital, and that he should wait for someone who actually finished college. He then got mad at her for the first time in his life and said ""you don't get the privilege to even speak her name"". When she figured out that wasn't working, she switched to threatening him with not speaking to him again and taking him off her insurance. He did get scared by this (I don't blame him...she is a horrible woman) and cancelled the whole living together thing.

I later got a call from Jamie's mother who told me she was on my side and that Jamie just doesn't know how to handle losing her son to another woman. She apparently told Jamie to quit bothering us and that if she didn't, she was going to have a one-way ticket to a ruined relationship with her son. After that phone call, things were very quiet. Jamie didn't talk to me, or my parents. She would invite my husband on family vacations and wouldn't get mad when she was denied for having not also inviting me.

And then...we eloped. They weren't present (hardly anyone was, only our witnesses and the officiant). When we told them, she had a fit and said ""we would've paid for the wedding!"" Her reaction when I spoke up and said ""HAHAH! Oh god, what? No, you wouldn't have"" was priceless, and she shut up again.

Now, she lets her daughter mistreat me. She, herself, acts as though tolerates my existence in my husband's life, but she laughs and gives high fives to her daughter when she says things that are particularly vulgar and offensive about me. She flat out encourages her daughter to be an absolute bitch. At one point I was holding hands with my husband while we were all out and sister-in-law purposefully slid in between me and my husband and pushed me away. When my husband got onto her about how pushing is not okay, Jamie got onto *him* about *his* behavior for yelling at her precious daughter (excuse me...your precious daughter just physically assaulted his wife, yeah he will be mad)

I've just stopped going out with them entirely. I tell my husband he can go, but I will not be. Last time I saw her was on mother's day where I didn't say anything and wouldn't let them pay for our meal or have any kind of leverage over us. We dined, paid, and left."
17,"Guys, Malbots is coming to visit (and more BEC!)",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb438bb70>,Carbonatite,0,38,57,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536082486.0,9cxvao,"Malbots is coming to visit.  I say this because I need advice,  and also to warn everyone in the Western United States, because while tornado season may be waning, we are about to get an EF5 level twister of sensible $200 loafers and Coach handbags up in here.  DH may need advice too, in case she can't come over the weekend he goes hunting.  He's pretty good at not getting upset by her antics because he finds it difficult to take Malbots seriously, but that doesn't mean he wants to shop for artisanal jewelry with her.

Speaking of advice, thank you all for your suggestions from the last post on addressing ingrained Malbots-induced behaviors like apologizing too much.  There was a ton of awesome advice for both DH and I and it is very, very appreciated.  As was the photoshopped image with stripes added to Malbots's MotB dress.

Things bode pretty well for the most part, Malbots would never stay with us when there are plenty of perfectly good ""economy"" hotels for her like the Hilton.  DH may be able to avoid her entirely if he goes hunting. I love that he would rather be cutting entrails from a dead elk than be around Malbots.  I am currently coming up with neutral things to do, since I doubt she will want to spend much time in our house with [these two derps](http://imgur.com/DqpNE2f).  Malbots thinks all adopted shelter dogs have behavioral problems.  To be fair, the dachshund did poop in my shoes for a few months after I got him, and both dogs have made valiant attempts at killing [this fluffer](http://imgur.com/ddsQpc8) and her ANGERY sister.  But considering Malbots's first dachshund literally sent people to the hospital with his bites, they're pretty good doggos.  As a former shelter worker, I also want to deservedly out her as a horrible human being: She repeatedly tried to make me give our other dog back to the shelter because Malbots thought she would overwhelm the weiner.  We got our dog from a rescue that adopts out dogs at risk for euthanasia.

I imagine Malbots will continue to try to convince me DH is a low class gold digger who thinks ""our family is a cash cow.""  How do I tell her that shit ain't cool without causing a fight? I am ashamed to admit I don't do much to defend my husband from her behind-the-back words.  I know DH gives less than zero fucks about what she says, but I also want to try and curb her constant shit talking.  

I guess my request for advice boils down to three things:

* How to manage her comments and behavior regarding me and DH, and actually stand up for DH for once.

* How to prepare myself for the inevitable anxiety before and during the visit.

* How to look her in the face after excoriating her on the internets and remembering things I'd repressed for years.  Basically, how do I deal with the guilt (not rational, I know) from telling people terrible stories about her on reddit?

Any advice is welcome, since your collective knowledge is gargantuan.  And now, more BEC moments, because I want to focus on ridiculous Malbots behaviors and ideas to make it all less terrifying. 

MALBOTS AND MY HEALTH

My body temperature is low.  It was 96.8 F for years as a kid and now ranges in the low 97s.  So 98.6 is a fever for me, and an actual low fever for most people is not that low for me.

Despite hearing this same thing at my pediatrician appointments for years, she insisted that I was exaggerating and trying to avoid school when the thermometer measured ostensibly-normal-but-actually-sick temperatures.  Bitch, school was an 8 hour break from you.  Anyway, I got sent to school with fevers for years.  

Overshare ahoy!!  Like seriously, I am going to talk about the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome in detail (and how Malbots ignored this until I was in grad school). Skip if you're not into descriptions of gastrointestinal distress.

So yeah, I have IBS and have had symptoms since age 14.  It started in my teens as excruciating pain after eating, generally lasting 3-4 days of hunched over misery as the pain was so bad I had trouble standing up straight.  Malbots said I was being dramatic.  Eventually the psychiatrist she hired as my ""doctor"" (because he straddled the line of HIPPA like a drunk 19 year old on a mechanical bull) was like ""dude, even I believe her, get her worked up for an ulcer.""  It was not an ulcer, ergo, Malbots was right and I was a painfully bloated fakey faker.

This was the way of things for years.  Eventually things got worse. The college health center evaluated me for an ulcer again.

Eventually I said fuck Malbots and her obsession with my malingering.  I was sick and needed a gastroenterologist.  After several cameras in several orifices, the doctor said ""Eh, probably IBS"" and I knew where to go from there.  He emphasized the need for stress control. 

Ironically, Malbots has an autoimmune condition which can cause similar symptoms.  She used to tell me I made it worse when I stressed her out.  It also causes a higher risk of certain cancers.  Let's all take a moment to savor this delectable irony. 

MALBOTS AND TIDY DOORWAYS 

Malbots made everyone remove their shoes at the door and leave them carefully aligned at the edge of the rug by the door.  I don't think this is terrible, taking shoes off at the door=less frequent cleaning.  But Malbots took it to the next level.  

Malbots also had a retainer at the time after having adult braces.  When she talked, she sounded exactly like ~~the nerdy kid who hits on Meg~~ Neil in Family Guy.  It was actually delightful, because it's hard to take verbal abuse seriously when the abuser sounds like an angry 6th grade D&D player.

Anyhoodle, one day my platform flip flops (early 2000s, obvs) had been haphazardly and sinfully left by the door.  Malbots yelled ""Carbonatite, pick up your **schews**!!""  I think there may even have been some angry spittle flying out.  I burst out laughing.  She threw the platform flip flop at my head.

MALBOTS AND *THE HELP*

Malbots ranges from tolerable to traumatizingly embarrassing in her interactions with service workers.  She does this weird wiggly finger wave thing to get servers' attention.  She sends back her wine and medium-well filet mignon about 25% of the time.  She never asks for stuff to be comped.  She doesn't care about money, she's just a dick to people.

On my 23rd birthday, my parents took me to a fancy Indian restaurant.  Malbots ordered something.  The waiter brought the something she ordered.  She claimed she ordered something else, the waiter politely showed her a menu and what she had ordered.  She claimed she ordered something else.  The confused waiter left after a gaslighting/beratement session to make the meal Malbots actually wanted.  She commented on how ""none of these people speak English well"" as he left, while still in earshot.  She made such an ass of herself that my dad added a $200 tip to a $120 bill out of pure humiliation and apology once she sauntered away from the table to the lobby.

MALBOTS AND OUTDOORSINESS

My family's attitude towards outdoor activity ranges from ""I ski occasionally in designer 1990s jackets"" to ""I literally climbed Mount Everest"".  DH and I lean towards the latter, though my current mountaineering status is ""I only lost a chunk of skin from my nose once while ice climbing"".  Malbots has no idea why we do such hazardous things as rock climbing and walking our dogs in dusty dog parks.  I still don't think she believes that my field gear for work includes hard hats, safety vests, steel toed boots, and jeans that only cost $30 covered with nitric acid stains.

Malbots's attitude towards this?  ""My idea of camping is a 3 star hotel with no hair dryer.""  Direct.  Quote.

Edited to add: DH is diligently reading your comments and is leaving his own here and there.  He actually reminded me of some wedding shenanigans I had forgotten in his last comment (previous post, see BitchBot for details). He is a cool dude.

18,The Weekend From Hell: in which I realize it’s neverending,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb40b9fd0>,dyingdill,0,22,54,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536082345.0,9cxuit,"For background: my SO’s mother and I got stuck alone together for an entire weekend. She brought an endless deluge of awful stuff to decorate SO’s new place, threw out some of my belongings, and has already brought up the prospect of her future grandbabies. By this point in the weekend, i have a constant eye twitch and might just go camp in the middle of the woods instead of staying another night with this woman. 

Anyway, it was blessedly finally Sunday. SO left with his brother at 5 am so he could be home as early as possible and save me. I was calling him every five minutes for updates, and his mom knew he’d be back by four- then she could leave and go the fuck home!!! She needed something from the store before then, and I wanted peace and quiet again, so I lent her my keys. She said she’d get lunch as well. This was at 11, neither of us had breakfast. 30 minutes pass and she hadn’t left yet, and my keys weren’t anywhere I could find them.

I checked up on her, and she was just chilling in the guest room. Cue another monologue when I ask what time she was gonna head to the store, “I’ll be right there I’m just checking my phone just give me five seconds I’m going right now don’t even worry about it Dill” 

Ah, how stupid I am.

I believed her.

Another hour later- but this point it’s almost 1:00 and I’m fucking starving. I hear the shower going though, so I’m pissed but I eat the last snack in the house and figure I’ll ask about where my keys are when she’s dried off.

Finally, at 2:00, I give up and go to grab my keys back and get myself some damn food. There she is- reorganizing SO’s closet, that he arranged exactly how he wanted it before he left on Thursday. 

She sees me and instantly starts another monologue about how she swears she’s going soon she just couldn’t let SO’s closet look such a mess and I need to “keep a better eye on him”. I smile, ignore it, and say “well, I’ve been hungry for several hours now soo I’m going to get food. I don’t want to be starving when SO gets here”

It’s amazing, y’all. Her ass took my keys out of her freaking suitcase was out of the door in five minutes- she even called me, got my exact order right, and brought the food back in less than 30 minutes. She immediately went back to the store, and was thus gone when SO got home. 

He finally got home, and we agreed she needed to go- the problem is he’s at their mercy at the moment. If he upsets his mom, his dad would stop supporting him- SO would have to stop studying for his big entrance exam, start working full time, and give up his dream of becoming [doctor/lawyer/you get it] because he can’t afford it. 
She gets home, she’s SOOOO excited to see her baaaaaaby and had suuuuuuch a great time with her baaaaaaby’s sweet girlfriend and I quietly gagged in the corner. 

By the time she got back, it was almost sunset. And oh no, she can’t drive in the dark!! Silly her, she’s run out of gas in the middle of the backwoods before and has hopped medians because it’s just too dark- she simply can’t drive at night. She literally GIGGLED and said “oh well, I guess I’ll just stay another night!” SO and I get to unpacking the kitchen together and I just start sobbing. I’ve been on the borderlines of a panic attack all weekend and it’s finally too damn much, she’s constantly talking and in my bubble and making me feel like I’m going insane. I can’t move into my new place for two more days and I just can’t relax with her in the same house as me. 

Surprise, surprise- SO tries saying we’re busy when I get back from work Monday, she cried and said he was trying to get rid of her. He panics, she stays another night. Rinse and repeat on Tuesday. Isn’t this woman’s husband missing her at this point? It’s been a whole ass week now. Finally, Wednesday during my move-in, she suddenly disappears right when we could use some help carrying boxes! Thus ends her reign of terror- until we can’t find my birth control that night.

It was in the damn bathroom trash can, I’m guessing she thought we’d assume it got lost during the move and idk??? Just risk it??? Smile through the pain when I have an unmedicated period??? 

Regardless, I told SO I would not live with him until we’re self supported and can feel more comfortable in laying down strict boundaries. I also told him that from here on out, I will not be alone with her and will leave wherever we are if she says anything I don’t like. The problem is putting that into practice though- I feel like a limp noodle and get so anxious around domineering people that I’m worried it’s going to take a lot of time and practice. SO and I plan on getting married after I graduate and I don’t want to let this be the rest of my life. 

So, any advice along that vein would be more than welcomed! Also, any nickname suggestions y’all have got... I have more stories I can tell, and I’m sure there’ll be more madness in the long run.

Womb Landlord (WL henceforth because jesus, descriptive or no that moniker is way too long to type a bunch of times) raised me to be her emotional toilet. I had no idea this wasn't how things worked for everyone - I remember reading one of those schlocky Chicken Soup for the Soul books and seeing a story about how this woman's mother was her best friend now that she was an adult and just thinking ""how?"" Because I was seven, and my mother was telling me about how we might not make it home because she only had the pennies in the cupholder for gas.

I turned the heat in the car off, on a very cold night, for which I was completely inappropriately dressed, because I was afraid we wouldn't make it home.

I.

Was.

*Seven.*

It never got better. She told me about how she had to kick my father in the balls for... some reason. When I turned nine, after they'd broken up, I jokingly said I wanted a younger sibling.

Next morning, she told me they'd had sex because of it. And expected me to be grateful. Because I said I wanted a sibling.

I was nine.

We moved to a new place that my grandmother bought when I was eleven.

She kept me up til 4 AM wallpapering.

And then later because she was using my laptop.

Which was mine. Except when she wanted it.

At three AM.

I was eleven.

ANYWAY DH works for a large company. Offices in multiple states, etc. We told the new location not to release ANY info about husband. Don't confirm that he works there. Nothing. 

Death Cookies called the old location and played the 'forgetful old lady' and managed to get the number of the new location DH transferred to. She then proceeded to call the new location. The receptionist didn't get the memo, apparently, and gave her DH's extention. As soon as he picked up he was treated to ear piercing wailing. Not talking or crying. Just full on banchee wails. He hung up, she called again. And again. She left 12 full voicemails of this before his mailbox was full. Then she switched back to calling the receptionist and wailing at her. 

DH was called in to a meeting with HR and had to provide copies of the RO. Legal is sending her a letter. The police in old town have been notified. IT had to set up a whole new extention for DH. I believe they've blocked her number as well but it won't stop her. 

But now Death Cookies knows where we moved. At least we already have security cameras, I guess.

21,The subtle criticism of The Queen of Bitchlandia,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb3c6fac8>,SoVeryTired81,0,60,353,False,JUSTNOMIL,Sucks to suck Bitch!,1536043949.0,9ct7ri,"This is of course all in the past. Reflecting on the Queen lately has seen me realising that the Queen didn't approve of my parenting like ever. Like I knew there was some but it was just about everything. 

1. I swear around my kids. I always have, I taught them that there are kid words and grown up words and they shouldn't use grown up words. Now that they're older I ask that they not swear around adults out of respect. Swear with your friends all you want. If you get into trouble at school for swearing I'm going to let them punish you in an appropriate manner. 

The Queen HATED this. She frequently said ""if there's one thing I regret about raising you all its that I swore around you so much."" 

2. I do minimal policing of television. I don't let them watch Gore, I don't let them watch overly sexual stuff. We watch Futurama, Bob's Burgers, etc. If it goes too far we pause and discuss. 

The Queen forbid us from a LOT of stuff on TV. ""The Mighty Morphine Power Rangers?"" Totally about drugs. Once Aunt Becky joined the cast on full house it was banned for being overly sexual. The Simpson's was a hard no. She frequently pearl clutched about the stuff my kids watched. 

3. Growing up I was forced to eat basically everything. I have sensory issues and this was straight up hell for me. I have an autistic daughter and the Queen frequently told me to just force her to eat stuff. Even after we got a diagnosis. 

4. I don't have shit fits till my kids do as I ask. I frequently was told that if I was just more aggressive about them doing chores they would. She only had to yell sometimes! Yeah we were terrified so we usually snapped to if she wanted something done. 

Those are just a few. Anyone else have examples of their mother or MIL disagreeing with parenting choices?"
22,I'm losing my mind,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb3c77b38>,antisocialprincess92,0,12,36,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536088077.0,9cypbn,"I have posted previously about my future MIL and how she recently joined Primerica. 

Since then, things have been extremely stressful between me (26/F) and my bf (27/M). From the very beginning I was skeptical and expressed my opinion to her, urging her to reconsider. She rejected everything I had to say and convinced my bf to attend a presentation, and to bring me along. We were lied multiple times by her new boss, who was so clearly a con man who figured out pretty quickly there was no way I was leaving my medical billing job with full benefits for Primerica. He did think he had a shot convincing my bf who is 3 months away from getting his degree to become an accountant that he should throw that dream away and join his mom's ""team"", though. 

Since then, my bf's mom has tried relentlessly to convince my bf that he should work with her. That Primerica is so legit and being an accountant would be a waste of time. That he'll be making 60k a year, which is nothing compared to what he could make at Primerica. That everything we've found online, proving her boss to be a complete liar who has been to court multiple times for wage garnishment, is not what it looks like. That her boss is really a millionaire. 

A week ago she called my bf, saying that he owes her 1500 for money that was gifted to him over a year ago. This was after my bf made the mistake of telling her about the scholarship he'd just received, which would cover the rest of his schooling. She originally said this 1500 was sent from his uncle in Mexico and it was never established that this was a loan before. Ever. But now it is. Supposedly she can't pay her mortgage but my bf's brother who lives with her rent-free knows nothing about that. She was just on a trip to Florida this past weekend for a Primerica conference, which she had to have financed herself, despite being broke and in debt from living off credit for nearly 2 years. 

My bf told her via text that he won't pay her the money until she quits Primerica. That he will help her as long as she is going to make good financial choices. Otherwise she is going to continue needing his financial support that he simply cannot afford to provide regularly. She texted him back, belittling his career dreams and shaming him for not supporting her. Saying she is heartbroken over his words and his skepticisim. That he is not realizing his true potential by going to school for accounting and he is making a mistake by not joining her. 

I was **livid**. I actually started crying when he was telling me what she texted to him. To think a mom could say that to her son, who has been working so hard in college and is so close to graduating....it is bewildering to me. I have a seven year old and can't imagine speaking to my son that way when he is working to achieve his goals that will give him an honest income.  I wanted to call her up and pop off at her but it took everything I had not to. I seriously don't want to see this woman again. I don't want to be around her in any capacity. What she is doing is making me so angry, I can't even fully express the anger I feel. I know that you're not supposed to alienate the person whom you're trying to help out of an MLM/cult but at this point I don't even care. I don't care what happens to her as long as she doesn't think my bf is doing a single thing for her. I feel like a bad person for thinking this way but I can't help it. She crossed the line and has no remorse. 

I can't help but worry that this will tear me and my bf apart. He still gives his mom the benefit of the doubt and says her actions are just a result of the brainwashing her MLM has done to her. As much as I can believe that has had an effect, I don't find that to be enough of an excuse for her numerous attempts to manipulate and shame my bf into allowing her to **scam** him. Family has got to mean more than some ""business opportunity"". 

I doubt this is the end of this craziness. I think she is going to break my bf down so badly that he helps her, and I'm worried. He is clearly hurt by that conversation. Even if he is sticking to his guns about the money right now, I do not doubt she will continue trying to manipulate him. I just want her to go away and stop making this our problem. "
23,Introducing ... my GMIL in “Adventures in Caretaking” Long long long,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfacebe048>,cityvengeance,0,12,48,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536080001.0,9cxh40,"As a preface, I’ve been with my husband for almost three years now. We have one child together, both of us have fairly large families. Everyone is fairly okay, some are better than others. Except for his mothers side, the controlling and incontinent matriarch is his grandmother, who is a total JustNo. She rules from her lift chair, when she isn’t busy asking everybody to live her life for her. 

This woman has pretty much always had it easy. Came from a well-off family, has no idea about money to the point of her having a double-mortgage on a house that shouldn’t have one. She will however only spend money for new items for herself. She gives out weird shit from her hoard that is obviously used or bought from a flea market. (But she expects beautiful new things herself. 🙄) She is a Good Catholic with a penchant for indoctrination. She loves to gossip about anybody and anything. 

GMIL has no concept of appropriate behavior. Upon asking her to please not be naked in front of my husband, even if she is somewhat covered, she promptly burst into tears and told me I was “cruel and strange for thinking the way I do”. “I know where I stand!” She cried out, heaving and whining. We don’t want to fucking see you naked. That’s a pretty adequate request if we are in your home helping you out. 

Which brings me to this. Almost a month ago we were asked to help caretake for her. We lasted almost three weeks. It was me, DH and toddler. I would have to actively ignore my toddler because this horrible woman would tell me her needs are more important than my child’s. She would call me at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 in the morning. All night. “I’m so *lonely*, CV,” she says as I’m running on two hours of sleep. Talking at me even after I requested to be let go from the conversation. So much shit to deal with. The toddler has far better manners than her asshole great-grandma.

Which brings me to why we left. 

One morning I am sitting with Toddler in the couch, watching Pocoyo. I can occasionally hear strains of conversation from GMIL’s room, with all her equally-hideous-inside friends. What I hear next stops me in my tracks as I carefully stand up and set toddler in the baby jail. 

*”I think CV and [husband] are drug addicts. I can tell by the way they are. Did you know she only fed me a piece of toast this morning? And then she had the audacity to go out and smoke a cigarette. The dog hid under the bed from her because she’s so awful. She neglects me and the baby! I try to be so nice to her but she is so sour and mean. I don’t understand why her and [husband] are together. It has to be the drugs. I just don’t see what he sees in her.”* And this went on for almost two and a half hours. All this insulting bullshit about me. She barely knows me, she blatantly made up crap about me. 

Hold the fuck UP. This woman had been praising me all the time (which made me incredibly uncomfortable). Always going on about what a good wife I am and this and that. I knew she was a two-faced narcissistic witch. And that’s when I decided *fuck this I am going home, fuck this 77 year old bully*. After she got off the phone, I knocked on the door after she said “Come in!” all cheerily. 

I walked into her room, stone-faced. I’m a tall woman, with a serious RBF. She looked mildly perturbed. I told her we were going home that day, and I was packing all of our belongings. At first she acted delighted we were going and then immediately got suspicious. We were leaving two days earlier, why? I stared at her, took a breath, and in a low tone I said this:

“I want you to know we are leaving because I can hear *every. Single. Word.* that you said about me and DH. I heard all the nasty lies and everything else. You should be ashamed of yourself. Good luck trying to get anyone else to take care of you.” She sputtered and squeaked out with “well I tell you that you’re a good wife and mother!!”

I stared at her in disbelief and responded with “Just because you say this to my face is not what others are hearing. You called me a drug addict. You called my husband a drug addict. I don’t want to hear from you ever again.”

Then I slammed the door and got all of our shit together. This woman won’t be teaching my child how to act like a two-faced bitch. There are so many more stories about this evil creature but it felt good to beat her at her own game a bit. "

I’m currently pregnant with SO’s son. We are not married, however we are now living together. Boyfriend and I were together for over year, however boyfriends mom made no effort to get to know me until after the pregnancy was announced. At first it was great, and then once he moved out she totally changed. She has been not so nice to me this entire pregnancy. I have had feelings she did not like me at all, but bf continues to deny it and says it’s just me being sensitive until recently when we argued. After this I had enough, I texted her saying if she had an issue with me that I would like a conversation about it. Instead of texting me, she texts SO about it. Saying “I think a conversation needs to be done over face” exactly what I had said. Now I get the feeling she was only trying to stir the pot because she texting him saying “I didn’t mean to cause problems between y’all, I figured you knew about her texting me, however I think we need to have a face to face discussion”. It didn’t cause problems, and she never brought it up to me, or at all. Fast forward a month of me staying out of her way, she texts SO asking if he would like a baby shower. He responded that I would like one so she begins planning one and inviting all of her friends and family “to celebrate the upcoming birth of her first grandson”. However, I recently found out she has invited SO’s ex girlfriend to the baby shower. She was the only non-friend and non-family member she invited. His ex is not friends with him, and through the guest list there wasn’t a single friend of his invited. I brought this up so SO and his response was that she’s friends with his exes mom. Even so, why invite her too? Or at least ask me? "
25,MIL and the 'homemade soup',<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb3ab3fd0>,Sheanar,0,18,228,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536048521.0,9ctn2t,"I recently joined this sub, and seriously you folks are the best. I've got a JNMIL (NC for 3yrs), a JNXMIL(LC), and a Nmom(NC 1yr). So really, great. Finally feeling like I'm not alone and in many cases seeing abuse for what it is. I could write so much just on what I've learned, but there is another sub for that.

For my first post I have decided to feed the llamas with a great BEC moment from JNMIL.

Backstory: I've known my BF for about a decade, but we've only been together a few years on account of her meddling. She's been spreading lies about me since she heard of me. Eventually, he grew a spine and we got him and his brother away from her.

Right before I moved in with my BF, YGMIL died of a heart attack, and right after GFIL was diagnosed with cancer. We live literally next door to him, so we took care of most of his day-to-day care (despite JNMIL's sister living next door on the other side - they shared a patio). Every so often JNMIL or JNMIL's sister would bring by leftovers and stay for a little bit, but then he'd call myself or BF (or BF's brother who lives with us) to help him clean up the mess they made. 

One time I was helping him with phone calls to doctors and making him lunch when JNMIL came over. She was oscillating between pretending to be happy I was caring for her dad and CBF. It was so awkward every time I had to deal with her. So on this one occasion she made a big show of this up-cycled yogurt tub full of ""homemade soup I *just* made last night. You can reheat it for him for dinner"". She went on about how good it was but eventually stuffed it in the fridge and left. 

Cancer is ruthless, and GFIL had no teeth in the first place and couldn't use his dentures. The guy was living on soups and mashed foods. If she cared at all she could ask him what he'd like or what he's been eating. But then she wouldn't be a JN, would she? 

The soup she was going on about was just some canned beef chunk soup she had put into a tub and made this huge story to feel good about herself. GFIL took one look and said he wouldn't eat it. When I showed it to BF and BF's bro we all agreed to just push it to the back of the fridge and wait for a good chance to toss it. She's one of those people who just don't care. She brought him soup for herself, not really for him. I knew it, she knew I knew it, but I was just smiling and nodding to make her leave faster.

Not directly related, but sort of. After she saw how much GFIL trusted me with his care she lost her shit (more) and added to the list of lies she was telling her side of the family about me. My ""favourite"" being that I wanted dead YGMIL's jewelry and such. Unfortunately it worked. By the time of GFIL's funeral none of that side of the family will talk to any of us, except for BF's 2 half-sisters (3 different dads between them) and they're on book of faces birthday card level contact.

26,General clinginess and GPS tracking,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb3ba9630>,arkhamdovahkiin,0,77,38,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536081307.0,9cxosi,"Hey everyone, I’ve lurked for a while and am posting for the first time about my FMIL. For the most part, we get on really well and she is (mostly) JustYes. However there is just one thing that bugs me and it’s that she is quite clingy!

Me and my SO are both 19 and at university (starting 2nd year next month) and have been together for 2 years and although she’s gotten a bit better since we got together, FMIL is very clingy. My SO is her eldest child and she doesn’t like to let him go anywhere without knowing and if possible supervising/accompanying him. 

For example, she insists she take him to his doctors appointments and any time he has even a slight cold she will act as if he is dying. This one bugs me because a few months ago I went to A&E (emergency room) from midnight til 10am for abdominal pain and she did not accompany me (we were staying with them) or ask me if I am okay (FFIL and SO took me). 

In comparison, for the 1st year of our relationship SO and I were long distance, and she forbade me from visiting on a planned trip once because SO was “very ill” (he had sniffles,  not even a cold) so she could look after him. 

When we moved to uni halls last September she did not like this change at all and insisted we come to see them every single weekend. I didn’t mind this that much, it was nice to see them and their cats, but we couldn’t go more than a week and a half without a call saying we *need* to visit. 

The problem I wanted advice on is the Life360 app, which is a family tracking app. My FSIL is 15, so it makes sense for her to be on it, but SO doesn’t need to be tracked and it notifies her every time we leave university. 

Once, she phoned in a hurry at 7PM asking where we were going because it notified her (we were just going grocery shopping...) and she acted as if we had no business being outside this “late”!

This Sunday we move into a studio flat in a different area of London and I don’t want it to be on the tracking app. I’ve tried asking my JustYes FFIL and he said it’s just how she is and I “won’t understand” until I’ve had my own children, as if this is how all mothers are. 

My own mum is very JustYes and does not track me or ask where I am going; she is much more easygoing and less overbearing.

My mum lives 3 hours away vs my FMIL living ~30 minutes away from us, so we’re hardly very far from my SO’s family (which I could maybe use as justification for tracking him if we were very far away). 

It just feels like FMIL won’t let SO grow up: I really like and get on with her 90% of the time but on the topic of my SO she will not budge on being overbearing and trying to micromanage his life. 

If anyone has any advice on how SO or I can broach the topic of asking not to be tracked with her without making her upset or feeling attacked (I don’t want to make her feel bad) I’d love to hear it. 

TL;DR - my boyfriend and I live together while at university and my FMIL insists on knowing where he is at all times via a tracking app. What can we do about this?"
27,"She hid with the druggies, fanatics and freaks",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb39cfcf8>,ConvolutedTomorrow,0,6,47,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536075933.0,9cwszp,"^(I don't know how to start this, but I was triggered by a TV program about cult survivors and have had memories flooding through my mind one after another, and I feel this gut-wrenching urge to get it out even though I don't know where to begin.)

_______________________________________________________

**For those who don't know, my mother is a sociopath.** Yes, she was diagnosed, and I will probably bring myself to write about in the future. She's not your average selfish narc, there is something truly evil and cruel in that empty void, a void that she filled with my screams and tears. She was never phased by the idea of killing me or harming me beyond recognition and probably would have if it wouldn't get her ""toys"" taken away, she didn't have empathy or guilt, she just didn't want to be caught and prevented from doing whatever she wanted.

In the beginning, she was sloppy, mimicking emotion posed more of a challenge and she was slower to figure out what was expected and how to respond. As a result, she had more slip-ups and people ""wised up"" a lot faster. Most people would begin to realise something was ""wrong"" pretty soon after meeting, she never quite ""sat right"", breaching the uncanny valley, and left a sickly feeling in the pit of your stomach; her face would move but her eyes were dark windows into something so sinister and silent it made you want to scream and you couldn't say why. The smart ones left within a week or two, but she honed her craft over the years.

She realised that ""normal people"", even if they didn't want to know or do anything about it, would get suspicious and eventually question things. All the lies, manipulation and isolation in the world can't stop gossip. So she changed her focus to people whose capacity were reduced. It started with churches, they were already so fervent and gullible in her mind, if they could reject reality for this imaginary group experience with God, surely they would accept her and ignore how fucked up she was. **And the scary part was, she was right.** 

All she had to do was be a ""poor Christian woman seeking God and salvation"", and they would forgive her of anything and everything, embracing her as she used them as pawns in her game and provided a perfect cover for abuse. This later escalated into more outlandish and cult-like religious groups that included writhing around on the floor during prayer and speaking in tongues. To an outsider, they looked crazy, so they couldn't question her without taking scrutiny themselves. This trend continued as it opened a new avenue: People in need of help. Drug addicts and mentally unwell people cycled through her life, incapacitated by illegal substances that she continued to supply to lure them in and keep them around. In an altered state, they barely had the senses to function, let alone resist and it took longer for them to realise they needed to get out. Eventually, they cycled through her life as transient nobodies, many of whom were a risk to my sibling and I, trying to physically/sexually assault us and being abusive in many ways; but to us, no one could be as scary or damaging as our mother. 

She also weaponised sex with these addicts to emotionally abuse, using it to break my sibling mentally and destroy any comfort and stability they thought they had. All my life I became a meat-shield and tried to protect them, but there was only so much I could do, and even holding my hands over their ears as tears streamed down their face was futile against the fake and exaggerated noises coming from the bedroom designed to break them. I wasn't bothered by it, but the image of that scared and broken child is burned into my heart and fills me with angry tears every time.

From the outside, she came off as charitable and kind, helping desperate people. But in reality, she took advantage of their vices, vulnerability and kindness to serve her own purposes. 

**Those who got away have no clue how lucky they are, I'm sure they saw glimpses that scared them enough to save themselves... If they only knew how bad it could've turned out for them.**

**TL;DR:** *My mother is a crazy sociopath that covered her tracks by hiding amongst religious zealots and drug addicts, exposing me to some serious creeps and dangerous people, and used them to torture my sibling.*

_______________________________________________________


**For reference:** I have severe CPTSD due to abuse and neglect, this is a journey for me and I am still learning how to talk about it. My mother is a sociopath and a real risk, she has stalked and attempted to kidnap me multiple times, do not ask for personal info.

**Please do not share this outside of Reddit. This is very personal trauma, not drama.**  "
28,My MIL used to be my friend. Now she’s chosen an alcoholic creep over her family and we had to go NC.,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb39eafd0>,SunnyTheGinger,0,13,37,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536083753.0,9cy2ir,"I’ve been lurking on this sub for a long time thinking about how my own MIL is not the greatest, but normally doesn’t even come close in comparison to some of the monsters-in-law I’ve read about here. Over the last year though, she has become a source of immense stress not only for DH and I, but DH’s whole family. And I wasn’t going to make a post on here (because I genuinely think she could be much worse), but I recently went NC with her and I think it warrants a post-if not to satisfy your llamas, then to at least allow me to vent to some internet strangers. Also, sorry about some weird formatting. I’m on mobile. 

My MIL and I used to be really close. She displayed some behavior early on that should have raised some red flags, and we can get to that another time, but nothing seemed too out of the ordinary. We had a pretty normal, friendly relationship for the first 2 of my marriage. Fast forward to this past year and things are completely different. I went NC with her about a month ago and here’s why:

MIL got with this guy about a year ago. I’ll refer to him as MIL’s bf. DH and I disliked him from the start. This guy is a total loser and quite the alcoholic. He’s also downright rude and disrespectful. And creepy. He makes my skin crawl. At first I couldn’t even pinpoint why he made me so uncomfortable. I just got super negative vibes from him. I want to highlight some of the things MIL’s bf has done to give you all a general sense of how awful this guy is:

-He is an alcoholic and would literally rather spend his last dime on beer than food. My GMIL (MIL’s mom) typically has all the family gatherings at her house and banned him from drinking there. So instead, he hides his alcohol in MIL’s truck and goes out to the truck to drink while he’s at GMIL’s house. 

-Speaking of GMIL, he once tried to trip her and claimed it was just a prank. Tripping an elderly woman on purpose is cruel, not just some dumb prank. 

-My SIL’s fiancée (I’ll call her SILf) and I were pregnant at the same time. MIL’s bf always made stupid, creepy jokes about them being lesbians and inquired how one of them was pregnant, like it’s any of his business. My SILf has a nice shiny spine and doesn’t hesitate to tell him  to mind his own business. I guess he took that as an affront and started calling her fat any time he saw her. He never dared call me fat. I think he knows DH would crush him. 

-He and MIL were babysitting my SIL’s children and he told the youngest at the time (baby wasn’t born yet), a 3 yo girl, to go kiss the neighbor boy on the lips. He photographed the whole ordeal and sent the pictures to SILf. SILf was PISSED. 

-Another babysitting story. My SIL and SILf have 4 kids total. MIL and her bf  we’re babysitting the older 3 overnight (again, before the 4th was born). He slept in the same bed as all three kids, in his underwear, and took pictures of himself lying in bed with them. The pictures made me sick. They don’t babysit anymore. 

Those are just some of the main points about him to give you a general idea of what he’s like. He’s also a total mooch, doesn’t have a job or a car, is constantly asking for money that he just spends on beer, and he’s lazy. No one likes him. He’s just a rude, creepy loser and my MIL has gone downhill fast since they got together. And MIL keeps trying to force us to accept him as part of the family! When they got engaged she told DH, “ He is going to be your step father and you need to accept that.” Like, no bitch. He’ll never be part of the family. He’ll just be your dumb, creepy, alcoholic husband. 

And I have a suspicion that he is trying to turn MIL against DH and I because she has had a really shitty attitude towards both of us. For instance, MIL bitches to GMIL about me “being meeaan to heeeerr” and she “just wants her DIL baaaack” and she “doesn’t understaaaand why SunnyTheGinger has chaaaanged.” Like, she for real complained about my son’s name. DS is named after my FIL, and I guess she doesn’t like that. So instead of calling him by his actual name, because it’s sooooo hard for her to say her ex husband’s name, she started calling DS by his initials. I politely told her we’re not giving DS any nicknames and I’d prefer it if she called him by his actual first name. Her response was, “Well [DH] says I can call him by his initials.” I called her out on her lie (because DH and I had literally talked about the issue not even twenty minutes beforehand and I knew he didn’t like it either) and she went and told GMIL I snapped at her and wouldn’t let her give her grandbaby a nickname. Like, bitch. You don’t want to give him a nickname. You just don’t want him to have my FIL’s name! And for the record, she’s seen her graaaandbaaaaby twice since he’s been born. She’s had other opportunities but blew them off to hang out with DFI because DH and I won’t allow DFI near our son. I don’t even like MIL being near DS because she’s a heavy smoker and refuses to shower or wear smoke-free clothes before seeing him. She says “oh I forgot to bring clean clothes. I’ll just put on my jacket,” which, by the way, is also saturated with cigarette smoke. And then she complains when I won’t let her hold DS. Third-hand smoke is a thing, lady! “But I don’t ever get to seeee hiiiiimm!” Too. Damn. Bad. DS doesn’t even like her. He cries around her. 

When DH showed MIL his shiny spine and told her how shitty she had been since getting together with her bf her response was a curt, cold, “Well I guess I don’t have a son anymore.” She should have been apologizing for her behavior and here she was getting defensive and trying to make DH the bad guy. DH tried to brush it off, but I could tell it hurt him. She still hasn’t apologized. 

There have been other things my MIL has done here and there that have been building up for a long time, and I might talk about them at a later time. For now I’ll stick with the series of incidents that led to me cutting her out of my life. 

I want to preface with the fact that MIL asks for money and favors A LOT. DH and I stopped giving it to her long ago, but the point I’m trying to make is that she needs help from family a lot and she always gets it one way or another, despite her being shitty to everyone. This woman literally never thanks anyone or returns the favor. But DH’s family has always supported her when she needs it because they’re all good people. If MIL didn’t look just like GMIL and GFIL I’d swear she was found abandoned in a ditch somewhere. 

About 2 months ago I got a phone call from SIL to tell me that MIL left her bf after an argument they had ended with him threatening to burn down their home. I thought “yes, finally, maybe she has seen the light and is going to leave this asshole.” And I was actually concerned so I called MIL to make sure she was okay. She explained that he was drunk and yelled at her but never hit her and it was just a one time thing blah blah blah. I gave her some tough love and said, “Look, this is how it starts. He has shown you his true colors and this is the beginning of a long string of violent outbursts that will end with you getting hurt. You have to stay away from him. Any chance of redemption between your bf and DH and I had been lost forever. There’s no coming back from this; please be done.” She responded, “I think I will be done, but part of me wants to give him another chance. He hasn’t done this before. He didn’t know what he was doing and he doesn’t even remember it. But I’d never choose him over my children if that’s what it comes down to.” I told her if she goes back to him she’s literally choosing him over her kids and hung up. They were back together the next day. 

Fast forward a couple weeks and it happens again, go figure. This time must have been worse because their neighbor actually came over to see if my MIL was in danger. GMIL spent $300 to help her move her stuff out and gave MIL her spare bedroom on the condition that MIL had to leave for real this time. I called MIL and got no answer. I guess she didn’t want another dose of my tough love. Oh well. Didn’t really want to talk to her anyway. Two days later MIL said “fuck you” to the whole family and moved back in with her bf. 

I blocked her on everything as soon as I found out. I blocked her number, Facebook, Snapchat, everything. Part of me feels bad because I’ve been in an abusive relationship and I know it’s hard to leave. I try to tell that part of me to STFU. I’m over her drama. I’m over her taking advantage of good people and then screwing them over. I’m tired of her reckless, disrespectful, entitled attitude. I don’t want her near my child. There’s a slim chance I’ll ever talk to her again. DH hasn’t talked to her either, but he’s reluctant to block her because she has some health issues (which she’s lied about in the past, so who even knows if they’re real?) He agrees with me keeping our son away from her though. At this point I’m not going to make DH block her unless she does something bad directly to us or DS. It’s been about 6 weeks and she either hasn’t noticed or doesn’t care that I blocked her on everything. It seems unlikely, but I actually think she might not know because she’d bitch about it to GMIL as soon as she figured it out and so far GMIL hasn’t inquired about it. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I needed to vent. 

Oh! Before I finish this post, I want to add that just a week ago, I found out she has been lying to me for YEARS about something pretty serious. In a nut shell, FIL went to prison for a little while. He fucked up and paid the price for it, but he’s not a bad guy. He’s one of the most genuinely good and honest people I’ve ever met and I’m glad to have him in our lives. MIL lied to me about the reason he went to prison and I’m very angry about it. She made his crime sound so much worse than it actually was. She made some very serious accusations (some of which I knew weren’t true, but I stupidly believed the rest) and I wish she had to pay for that. I want to confront her and tell her I know about her lies, but then I remember keeping NC is more important. The worst part of it is she continues to ask FIL for money. And he gives it to her because his heart is made of gold. I just wish his spine was made of silver. We’ll have to work on that lol"
29,MIL Screenshoting Private FB Groups,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb39cf2e8>,Mkpencenonethericher,0,12,19,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536095446.0,9czrla,"Today, my lovely friends, my boyfriend’s mom for got that he texts her from my phone. She sent him screenshots of a post I made in a private FB group that she is not in. The group is about Gentle Parenting (my SO and I have a babber).She carefully clipped them to make sure she didn’t include my comments and tried to make it look like I was sneaking around behind his back to take custody of our child. 

Now is a good time for me to add that I love my SO, he’s an amazing father. I don’t want him to leave the room half the time, let alone leave our lives. We need him and love him. 

The best part of the story is that I used that post (which my SO knew about) to ask for advice to be a kinder partner to him when we disagree. We had read the post and all of its comments together as a spring board for solving the original problem together. 

TL:DR, showed my boyfriend nice things I said on the internet, his mom tired to spin it as mean. Also, why is she stalking me in Facebook groups? She’s not even my on my friend list. "
30,Step On Me's Emergency Mattress,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb6986d68>,kitethekite,0,23,25,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536087380.0,9cylks,"BF and I work 9-5 jobs so we typically go to sleep around 10pm, wake up around 6am. His mother knows this.

We wake up on Sunday morning to multiple missed calls from her around 11pm-midnight. Plus, a text from BF's brother saying ""kitethekite tell BF to check his phone. BF, call our mother"". Our phones are usually kept on silent, so nothing woke us up. We saw all this first thing in the morning and started to panic, thinking someone died.

We finally get in touch with her and what did she want? Who died? Whose car was totaled? What's the emergency? Oh, she just wanted her son to order a mattress online - not for her, but for her friend.

Not only is it crazy that she couldn't leave a text/voicemail saying ""hi, whenever you get a chance, call me, I need you to help me order something"", but it's INSANE that she then got mad at us. 

She was angry we were sleeping (at 11pm/12am) and not available to take her calls. She was angry we leave our phones on silent. She then slid into being angry about the fact that the two of us even HAVE phones in the first place, since, you know, the only people we ever talk to is each other... typical baby-boomer-mad-at-millennials-and-their-darn-technologies stuff.

Just needed to rant. Thanks."

I won’t go into details but long story short is that my boyfriends mom wants to be called “mama” by our daughter. 
It’s apparently Filipino culture, and she has 3 other grandchildren that call her that. 

I am not Filipino, I’m Puerto Rican and In Spanish “mama” means mom. and my daughter has already started to call me “Mama”. I never forced it on her, it’s just come naturally for her. 

I don’t want her calling his mom “mama.” I just want her to call her grandma or something else. Anything but “mama”. 

What do you guys think? I’m stressing out over this and my boyfriend doesn’t agree with me. He also wants our daughter to call her mama and I’m 100% against it.

32,JNM: Abandoning Puppies as a Hobby edition,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb3901898>,byacolate,0,10,77,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536061014.0,9cusrc,"TW: Animal neglect

&#x200B;

To round out the trifecta of living beings rottenly treated by my JNM, we move on now to: Household Pets.

&#x200B;

A little background: Growing up, we had several animals. Not in the animal hoarder capacity - no, we staggered our pets. Over a period of 18 years we kept approximately eight pets, and none of them remained in our home for longer than two years, and even that was a stretch. You see, my mother LIKED pets; just not the responsibility of them. She didn’t like that she had to pay for food. Or clean up after them (fur, poop, or pee - how fortunate that she’d given birth to human pooper scoopers). Or treat them for ailments. Or exercise them. Or keep them contained.

&#x200B;

The notion that someone could grow up with a pet into adulthood was a myth to me. Surely pets only lasted as long as your mother was entertained by them! People having deep long bonds with animals was some real *Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover’s Soul* propaganda.

&#x200B;

There is a particular breed of dog that my mother has always loved (chow-chows. They're wonderful, majestic creatures, so it's understandable). She had one when I was born that she never got over (but strangely did not keep) and when I was about 16, she decided it was time to adopt one again. Well, the puppy was perfect in every way, and just a month or so after, we go back to the breeder (yes, I know) and adopt another. 

&#x200B;

(Allow me a moment of BEC: This second puppy bonds with me immediately. Even sleeps with me like all those lucky kids in the picture shows. So it should come as no surprise to anyone that he is the one ousted a short few months later when mother dear is tired of having two big dogs around.) 

&#x200B;

We keep this large, wonderful dog for about half a year when JNM decides one day: “We should get a tiny dog for BB so he can learn responsibility.”

&#x200B;

So she seeks out another breeder (yes, I *know*) and we bring home a tiny white puppy. Very energetic. Very sweet. Really loves people.

&#x200B;

Fast forward a year and a half. Now she was **too** energetic, **too** sweet, and loved people **too** much.

&#x200B;

This takes place about half a year before I make the decision to go NC. I had been abroad for three months for work, and returned home for a week-long visit. (My very charming mother was crowing on the drive back from the airport about how she’d told eeeveryone at work that her daughter was coming home and so she had to get the house cleaned up - and then she simply hadn’t done it! She’d spent the day doing other things! Just didn’t do a damn thing with the house! Can you believe one person can be SO quirky and yet SO classy all at once?)

&#x200B;

It’s nighttime. We get in the house, and everything is a mess. Shed dog hair all over the floor, the furniture, everything. The dogs are very happy to see me, especially little sweet Lizzie. It becomes clear very quickly that I am the only one still charmed by her.

&#x200B;

She is *starved* for affection. At best everyone ignores her, and at worst they shove her away and shout at her. So I make a point to give her some affection. 

&#x200B;

And that’s when I notice the fleas. 

&#x200B;

And the ticks, some as big as my pinkie nail, so they've clearly been there a while. 

&#x200B;

They are *all* over her tiny body. When I confront my JNM about this, she breezily answers something to the effect of “oh, that’s probably because she hasn’t been bathed since you left”. 

&#x200B;

I was the last to bathe this dog, who spends several hours a day outdoors, over three months ago. 

&#x200B;

I’d been awake for over 24 hours, traveled over the ocean, been through multiple long connecting flights, but I knew that if I didn’t do something, Lizzie was going to spend another night as a feast for parasites. So I corral her into the tub - something she’s always been terrified of - and spend my first night back home carefully pulling ticks and fleas out of a screaming dog. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward a year or so. I was close with my mother’s then-boyfriend (the only decent man she’s ever been with), even after I went NC with her. He was from the country that I’d moved to to work in, and visited often, and so we saw each other frequently enough. When they’d broken up (he had a spine and used it, and she hated that), it took her quite some time to move out of his house. Since he traveled back and forth between his home country and mine, he was not present the day she finally left with my brothers. 

&#x200B;

When he returned from his business trip back to his home about a week later, the house was not empty.

&#x200B;

He found both dogs barricaded into his office room with two giant bowls of old dog food, and a week’s worth of poop and pee all over the floor. Yes, my mother had decided that there was one very simple way to both punish her ex and unburden herself of the responsibility of animal care with no effort whatsoever on her part. Who cares how it might affect the animals’ well-being? Who cares if something might have happened to her ex that delayed his return and left them starving, living in their own shit? Certainly not her!

&#x200B;

(TW: Animal death. I just remembered something as I was writing all of this up. Decent Boyfriend had had a dog from the time I met him to the day I left. He’d had her since she was a puppy ((and her sister as well, who had died years previously and whose ashes were kept in a very nice urn on the mantelpiece)). She was elderly, had trouble walking too long or quickly. Several months after I left, my mother in her classic slovenly fashion just let her wander outside because she couldn’t be assed to walk her. Decent Boyfriend gets a call from JNM to tell him that his very beloved elderly dog had been hit by a car. She died alone on the road, probably in a lot of pain given the nature of her wounds. The way she delivered this news to him was incredibly callous.

&#x200B;

Now what I’m about to say is all entirely speculation: while my mother is cruel in many ways, she has never been given to PHYSICALLY harming a creature apart from the occasional spanking. But I always found it odd that this could happen on a very straight, flat road in the middle of nowhere, where there is no visual cover around to hide an animal, nor could the dog physically “dart out” anywhere and surprise a driver. It was a two lane country road with a moderate speed limit - maybe 45-50 - that was never very busy, and she was a slow walking dog. For anyone to hit her - especially to the degree of the wounds they inflicted -  they would have had to had their eyes off of the road driving really fast for a very long time…..or it was intentional.)

&#x200B;

I want to leave you with a happy note. When Decent Boyfriend met with me after this fiasco, I was devastated and furious. He’d been able to rehome little Lizzie, but it was not so simple with the bigger dog. She was put into the local animal shelter, which was a kill shelter. I spent a long time looking over the shelter for her, and I was terrified when I couldn’t find her listed anywhere. I was afraid that they’d put her down since chow-chows are one of the “scary” breeds, and at the time were one of the top five breeds statistically likely to get put down first. 

&#x200B;

After emailing the director, I learned that she herself personally rehomed the big girl with a friend of hers who were enthusiasts of the same breed of dog, and had plenty of space to run on a giant farm. 

&#x200B;

Lizzie was rehomed with a retired couple who had another small dog, so she could finally get all the attention she deserved. 

&#x200B;

They’re both in the best places they could be, and completely out of my mother’s hands. 

&#x200B;

Little snotty PS from yours truly: Last year I finally got to know my mother’s only sibling, her sister, who she’s always hated. My aunt is very similar to my mother, but my mother is the dark mirror Just No to my aunt's Just Yes in many ways (including but not limited to their treatment of their gay daughters). Being with her was like stepping into an alternate dimension where my mother wasn’t a garbage fire in human clothes. One thing my aunt is well known for is her love of dogs. She has very, very many of them that she takes care of exceptionally well, and she keeps them for life. Their mother, my grandmother, never keeps multiple dogs, but she has a lifetime history of taking in one dog as a very close companion and spoiling it for its entire life. Spending time around these two women from my JNM’s past who are very successful at treating animals well makes my mother look even more incompetent and pathetic by comparison. If the shoe fits!"
33,Glum Gabby and the Pasta Throwdown,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb3911eb8>,Danceswithmorons,0,4,28,False,JUSTNOMIL,"O hai, Satan!",1536080528.0,9cxk5a,"*Recap: Glum Gabby is my fMIL. She is disabled and living on her own isn't really an option. She also meets all the requirements for 'independence' so big live in care / old folks home are out of reach at this time. SO and I are solid, he has a great spine. I live with SO and fMIL part-time so I don't rock the boat too much and have no immediate plans to move in full-time.*

So yesterday, let's talk about yesterday.

My day job is set hours at a computer - a virtual job.  I also freelance so I'm BFFs with my computer.  Glum Gabby has been told many times in the past by SO to leave me alone when I am working.  Now, I'm not heartless - some small tasks are totally fine.  But the unspoken rule is that (1) it has to be something she has tried to do and (2) if it can wait until I'm off the clock it waits.

Pretty simple stuff.

Even though the household now includes SO's niece (Glum's granddaughter) and niece's young daughter - many days when I'm here it is just Glum and I until they get off work.

So yesterday... It all started with a pair of shoes.  Neice's daughter's birthday is around the corner and she loves shoes that have sparkles.  Glum wants to get her a pair.

Glum comes in the bedroom, telling me the plan and asking if I can help her order the right size.  That's okay-ish.  Glum has ordered crap gifts off the internet before including this [ugly thing](https://www.google.com/search?q=monkey+shirt&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwixxd_726HdAhUQlKwKHb6ZARsQ_AUICygC&biw=1600&bih=794#imgrc=VXswtv03ctzrJM) and PJ's that are beyond too small.  So, confirming the right size should only take a quick glance at her phone.

Only, this is Glum Gabby.

She hands me her phone, and it's on an EBay search screen.  I know this is somewhat petty on my part, but it's obvious that she hasn't tried or picked out the shoes yet - and she is trying to get me to pick them out for her.  I tell her, ""You handed me a screen with lots of shoes, pick out the ones you want and I'll be happy to confirm the size.""  She gets pissy, clicks on a pair without paying attention and hands me the phone back.  

""Those are adult sizes only.  You have to find the ones you want first.""

A flood 'can't's came rolling out.  And when I basically repeated myself she shot back, ""You always have an attitude with me.""

""Well, you have interrupted me when I am working to do something for you when you haven't even picked out the shoes.  I will be happy to confirm the size for you - but you have to pick out the shoes.  And you coming in here is the same thing as coming into my office.  This is my work time.  I agreed to help, but I won't order them for you.""

Thinking she was being slick, ""I just won't come in here and bother you anymore then."" 

""Okay.  Thank you.""  Being polite with her is always a fun tool.  She hates that she can't run to SO and say I've called her a name.  She always has this look on her face like she accidentally walked into fresh dog poop barefooted when I 'thank' her instead of chasing her down and consoling her. 

And that was the end for a few hours.  But in JustNo fashion Glum Gabby was stewing.  I did shoot off a simple text to SO to let him know that ""I was a horrible person who told his mom 'no'.  I'm the meanest ever.""  Followed by a juvenile gif war so he would know he was coming home to potential drama.

I cooked a quick pasta dinner.  Enough for everyone.

Everyone was home, but SO was in a back room.  Niece was fixing a plate for her and her daughter and offered to fix Glum some.  At first, Glum wanted it - and then Niece said the unthinkable.  ""OP made it.""  

Glum changed her tune, she didn't want it.  Niece looked at me confused and I whisper that Glum was mad at me for something small.  Quickly said how Glum doesn't really like me in general and she loves picking silly stuff with me.  Niece didn't quite know what to do with this info - beyond being a bit surprised.  Niece drops it and sits at the table.

But war was brewing.  

SO came out from the back.  He also offered to fix Glum a plate.  She said 'no'.  I told him what he had missed with Niece.  

To color this - Glum never says no to food.  She has eaten my cooking and pasta more times than I can count.  If you bring her a plate of something she will always say yes or take it because it means she is waited on gets to be lazy.

SO went Hulk-mode.  It was sexy as hell. He must of asked ""Why aren't you eating"" 15 odd times.  

And I hear you... That gave her attention etc.  Glum only thrives on attention when she is the victim.  So instead of ""she was so sad, and hurt, and blah blah blah"" SO flipped it to ""What is YOUR problem Mom?""  To which she already lost.  She wasn't being allowed to sulk.  Niece wasn't coming to her rescue.  No one felt bad for her or was rushing to her side.  Instead, it was ""What is YOUR problem?""

The best part?  After Glum Gabby got her plate dinner rolled on.  SO, Niece and I had a conversation about vegetarian food (something Glum always tries to make me feel bad about) and Niece's other grandma who she is really really close to.

Suck it Glum Gabby.  

P.S.  I'm writing this because it helps me keep the incidents in order and I believe things are about to get more interesting.  I also think it is important to show how a SO can completely have your back and how that can zap a lot of the JustNo's 'power'.  

And if you are only commenting to tell us to look into other living arrangments.  That will happen with time - but right now it isn't possible. Glum has no savings and doesn't receive enough assistance to fund it.  It is in the pipelines but some other benchmarks have to be met first."
34,I think my own mom will be (is?) a JUSTNOMIL,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb6986cc0>,readyrosie,0,24,82,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536058393.0,9cuj6n,"Let me set the stage: I (24f) have been dating my partner (30m) for over a year. Shortly after our anniversary, we moved in together and it’s been really lovely. I could go into a novel about all the ways we are compatible, but I don’t think that adds to the story, so just believe me - he’s great! Another important tidbit- I was raised Southern Baptist but I accidentally became a feminist instead. 

So here we go:
My SO has always followed my lead with my family because we are a weird bunch. When we decided to move in together, I decided that we would wait until about a month before our move-in date, take my parents out to a nice dinner, and break the news. Unexpectedly, my mom went out of town so we were only able to tell my dad. He was great, congratulated us, and wished us well. Since I wanted my mom to hear it from me first, I had to settle for a phone call to her.  Here’s the gist of that phone call:
“If he loved you, he wouldn’t live with you before marriage” (Mom, I love and respect you, but this is my choice.) “I raised you better than this!” (Mom, you raised me to be an independent and free-thinking woman, which I am so thankful for!) “You are DENYING ME the chance to pay for your wedding one day” (Well Mom, one day we are going to have a wonderful wedding and I want you to be involved, but that will have to be your choice.) “GOD WON’T LET THIS HAPPEN! I’m going to pray for you and WATCH, it won’t happen!” (At this point, I reiterated that I loved her, but I also wasn’t going to argue with her. I told her that if she wanted to have a conversation about our reasons for moving in together, that’s fine... but I wasn’t going to get in a religious debate.) 

End phone call. 
Cue the prayer chain. 

Over the next few days, I received calls, texts and emails from family and church members letting me know that my mom had contacted them, and that they would be praying for me. I also received many weepy texts from my mom telling me that I’ve broken her heart, worried about my safety(?) and lots of other emotional dialogues. One time I called home, and she hung up on me saying that she couldn’t hear my voice without crying. 

So move-in day comes and goes without a hitch. Thankfully for us, we did not get struck down or break up from my mom’s prayers. Woohoo! 

More recently, my mom has uninvited us from one family event and refused to speak to us at another. When we were uninvited, I let it roll off my back because I hadn’t wanted to go anyways. However, the refusing to speak got undeeer my skin. We went over to their home for a family lunch, and she said 2 words (hi, bye) to me and 0 words to my SO. We left as soon as lunch was over because I was so embarrassed about that way my SO had been treated. In the car on the way home, we reflected on the day, on our feelings, and made a game plan for future encounters. (yes, he’s willing to try again!!!? He’s been so forgiving and understanding through this whole thing!)

This morning I woke up to another text from my mom saying that she was so concerned about me and I should MOVE HOME. This was the last straw and I sent her a very firm response telling her she needs to stop, calling out her behavior, and telling her that nothing she does will change my mind. No response yet, will update if it’s anything worthy of an update. 

Also, if you’ve made it this far, my SO is planning on proposing sometime later this year, we want to elope to Mexico next summer, and his family is wonderful! 

Phew. That was therapeutic to type it all out. "
35,Small Update and Advice Needed,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb474b588>,AllegraO,0,4,21,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536084665.0,9cy7kf,"So in my last post, I told you all how FMIL thinks FH and I should push our wedding out until June 2020 so FH has time to get a job and whatnot after finishing grad school.  That idea literally made me feel nauseous.  We’ve already pushed it out once; we were originally going to get married THIS June, aka three months ago.  I am *not* about to wait **another goddamn year**.  One of FH’s oldest friends, who we want to officiate our ceremony, suggested moving it to the fall of 2019, so postpone it by 3-4 months instead of 12.  That I can live with, and it’ll also make it a bit easier to find vendors who are still available.  Another bonus is that our honeymoon somewhere warm won’t have insufferable heat, because it’ll be in the beginning of fall instead of the beginning of summer.

Now, the advice I need is twofold:
•How should I tell my mom we want to pay for the wedding ourselves?
•What should I write to the people we’re uninviting?  “We’ve had to push the wedding back and move the venue, and the new venue can only accommodate 100 people”?"
36,"""I made your vagina! You're not allowed to use it!"" Says My Mother",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb39268d0>,EzraViolet2,0,7,13,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536094981.0,9czp5x,"Yes, my mother really said that to me. Yes, she was serious. Not sure if anyone remembers me, my other account got deleted but I'm under the same name again. The last time I updated, my head space was pretty dark and it showed in the post so that got deleted, apologies mods. Anyways, some memorable moments with my mother have been her accusing me of masturbating to hearing her have sex, accusing me of trying to seduce a grown man when I was 11, threatening to burn my fingers off as a child if I ever touched a lighter, treating me like absolute trash while I was in the hospital after a suicide attempt, told me in graphic detail how she received oral, would say sexual things that would make me very uncomfortable,  the list goes on.

​

Even through all that though, the thing she does that I can't stand the most is try to control my personal life. She told me my whole life I wasn't allowed to date until an age she chose, any potential boyfriend would need to be vetted and approved by her, not allowed to have sex unless she approved and gave the okay, but only after talking to the guy beforehand, no sexual talk of any kind with any guy ever, no telling anyone I was a virgin, dates are only allowed to be held at the tim hortons 20 minutes from my house, must text her every 10 minutes and update her as the date goes on, ask the guy a list of questions she came up with and report back to her with the answers, no one was allowed in the house. She said if she ever found out I was dating behind her back or had a guy over, no matter my age, she would kick me out. I could maaaaaaaybe understand a mothers concern for her daughter dating if the daughter was say 15 and the ""rules"" were less extreme. But I'm 18 ffs. And it's funny she has the no guest rule but constantly had men over and would loudly have sex with them when I was home, when I was a child.

​

Today she asked me if I was ready to start dating yet, I said no. I got enough on my plate and enough bullshit from her, I do not need the stress of dating and dealing with her extra shit. She went on to again explain to me all her rules. I lost my cool and told her for the 10000th time, I was not following her rules. She's been giving hand jobs since she was in like 6th fucking grade, she's a self proclaimed feminist (more like feminazi) and constantly talks about how sexually liberated she is and yet this is the shit she tries to stick her adult daughter with. I told her she was crazy and a hypocrite, if I want to have sex, I will. It is none of her business. She screamed at me ""I MADE YOUR VAGINA, YOU AREN'T ALLOWED TO USE IT UNTIL I GIVE YOU PERMISSION!"" I kinda just stared at her like did you really say that?

​

Mom- ""YOU ARE MY DAUGHTER, YOU WILL DO AS I SAY.""Me- ""Yeah nah, I'm not your fucking property. I'm done talking about this with you, you're insane.""

Mom- ""WHO ARE YOU EVEN GONNA HAVE SEX WITH! WHO WOULD HAVE SEX WITH YOU??? STOP BEING A BAD GIRL AND DO AS MOMMY SAYS!!! YOU'RE NOT READY, YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING!""

I stopped engaging at that point. She calmed down and tried to tell me ""Mommy just loves you so much honey, I only want you to be safe. A mother knows her daughter and I know you're not ready and I need to make sure you don't regret your decision."" I think she may be bipolar. Half the time she's trying to be her weird version of a loving parent, referring to herself as Mommy and telling me how much she loves me. The other times she's calling me every name under the sun, insulting me, making fun of my appearance, calling me fat, saying she doesn't give a shit if I kill myself, telling me if I weren't her daughter she wouldn't like me.

My silence apparently meant I was lying about not wanting to date and when my girl-friend texted me and I refused to show my mother my phone, she blew up again and was convinced I was talking to a guy.

""OMG YOU'RE TALKING TO A GUY! GIVE ME YOUR PHONE! GIVE ME YOUR PHONE NOW! HOW OLD IS HE? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, STOP BEING A BAD GIRL, YOU BETTER NOT HAVE A PROFILE UP, YOU BETTER NOT BE SEEING ANYONE, YOU BETTER STILL BE A VIRGIN!!!""

​

So yeah, that was my day.

37,My bro and SIL are terrible people for not being the right religion and getting a dementia sufferer the help she needs,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb392e0b8>,CastielGalafran,0,13,15,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536092244.0,9czb58,"I posted here about a week ago venting my frustrations about having to live at home right now. Things have actually been pretty good in my house since then. I know it's not a permanent change, but I'm just enjoying the good moments before things turn bad again. If I'm going to survive in this house for the next nine months I need to find ways to not be miserable all the time and for me that means appreciating the lulls in JustNo-ness.

​

Unfortunately, it seems like my mom always has to be JustNo to either me or my brother. She can never be great to both of us at the same time. Growing up, if my brother wasn't being hit or screamed at it was me. If it wasn't me, it was my brother. Both of us took turns being GC and SG, although I ended being SG more often because, by virtue of being 5 years older than me, he achieved independence long before me.

​

I just want to rant a bit about this. I feel bad ranting because my mom has been so much better this week, but it's at the cost of my brother and SIL's emotional well being. This whole drama involving the three of them has been going on since before my brother got married, when it became clear that SIL was a permanent fixture. I love SIL. She has been there for me since we met five years ago. She's a genuinely good person: bookish but feisty, progressive and open minded for a devout Catholic, and will weather any storm for someone she loves. I was a bridesmaid at the wedding. My brother and I weren't very close growing up, but we have become very close in the last three years. They had their first child, a girl, at the start of June. This is also my parent's first grandchild and my first niece.

​

The entire issue my mom has with SIL is that she is Catholic. My mom is devoutly Orthodox. She has always dreamed of me and my brother marrying an Orthodox Greek immigrant. In fact, she arranged a marriage for me when I was a child. When that fell apart, she attempted to arrange another but I was having none of that. Because I refused another arranged marriage, I was called hateful, spiteful, and told that the devil was influencing me. When my SIL's great sin of Catholicism came to light, the wailing and moaning from my mom was great indeed. She went to multiple priests and monks, telling them that this evil Catholic girl was tempting her sweet son, tricking him into marrying her for his money (they were both teachers with the exact same salary). One priest told her that my brother is going to go to hell for marrying a Catholic. Thankfully, the others told my mom to chill the fuck out.

​

I was the one, however, that bore the brunt of the crazy regarding this. I was living at home at the time, and nearly every day I listened to my mom tell me never to have kids, because all kids abandon their parents. She told me that she failed in raising both of us and that there was no point in life anymore. I can't remember the number of times she threatened suicide during that time. My brother did not have a great spine back then, and she convinced him to have two different weddings with full receptions. One would be Catholic, but the real one, as she called it, was Orthodox. My poor brother and SIL had to shell out the money for two weddings, with the exact same guest lists, on the same weekend. And to this day my mom whines that everyone looked sullen and sulky at the Orthodox wedding (that may be because everyone was sullen and sulky because they were hungover and exhausted).

​

My brother eventually converted to Catholiscm two years ago, shortly after I ""came out"" as not Orthodox. So, of course, since both parents are Catholics, my niece was baptized as Catholic. Personally, I don't give a fuck. The kid could be baptized Pastafarian for all I care, as long as she is safe and happy. The baptism was short, there was free food, and I got to pet a dog. I was pretty happy. My mom, however, is beside herself and has been for the last two months. She is convinced that Niece hates her, that my SIL is an evil harpy, and that my brother doesn't love her. She's back to telling me that children will always be ungrateful and hateful. She says she doesn't even know who my brother is anymore and that SIL is just a ""mean spirited, vicious little girl"". My mom knows not to rely on me for emotional support anymore, which means she's started saying these things to my brother.  Every time my mom brings this stuff up to me I defend my brother and SIL. But it never changes anything.

​

She acts as if she's being a great MIL by not telling SIL any of this, but SIL knows damn well the way my mom feels. And it hurts her. SIL has only ever wanted loving in laws. She has an extremely unstable family herself, and she tries so hard to win my mom's approval. Her own mother has a severe case of dementia and doesn't even remember her own daughter. BMIL (brother's MIL) lived with them for the last two years while SIL taught full time and my brother was in law school. They tried their best to care for her but her condition only got worse. She would leave the house, forget where she lived, and wander into traffic. She'd become scared and belligerent. Eventually, her condition got so bad that, right before Niece was born, they had to put her in a nursing home. It was an extremely hard choice.

​

But my mom only talks about how selfish they are for doing this. She says they abandoned the woman and should have kept her in their home. She told me to never abandon her like that. I get that my mom doesn't want to end up like BMIL. BMIL is suffering and in a horrible condition. But, as I have told my mom time and time again, my brother and SIL dedicated every free moment they had for two years to caring for this woman. The only reason they put her in that home was because keeping her in their's would have been dangerous for BMIL and for Niece. This was the safest, most responsible thing they could do. 

&#x200B;

(ETA: Just to make how great of people/a couple my brother and SIL are, their first year of marriage was spent living with me, my cousin, and my parents all in one house. They had maybe three months of getting to live together in their own place before BMIL moved in. Then they had a week on their own between BMIL moving out and niece being born. They've always placed caring for each other and others as the priority. When she's old enough, I want to offer to babysit Niece for a week or two so they can take a vacation together. Lord knows they need one.) 

​

I just hope that my mom never says any of this to SIL. It would hurt her so much. Last night, I listened to a long phone call between my mom and brother in which they argued about all these things I've just shared. My mom kept going on about how he doesn't care about her anymore, about how everything changed since SIL came in the picture, how now she'll never have a ""good DIL"", and that Niece will never love her. After their phone call, I texted my brother and told him that I love him and SIL no matter what, and that they're good parents despite anything my mom says. I know they both feel guilty and frustrated. It sucks.

​

I'm just glad that I'll be moved out, making great income, and probably in another state by the time me and my boyfriend (assuming we end up getting engaged and all that) tie the knot. He's an Atheist Mexican guy from a long line of devout Catholics. I'm pretty much Agnostic. Neither of us would want a church wedding. I dream of having a barn wedding in a forest. I will not have two church weddings, no matter how many tantrums get thrown. If anyone has a problem with it, they'll be last in line at the taco truck and donut bar.

​

TL;DR: my mom thinks my SIL is an awful person for being Catholic, and thinks that she and my brother are bad people for putting SIL's suffering mother in a place with proper care."

for background, i’m 19, nonbinary (important because egg donor exclusively calls me by my birthname/deadname), have been living on my own for nearly 6 months, and i’m currently working on trying to survive amidst the emotional/psychological pressure of recovering from abuse. my SO has been wonderful in helping me (including spending a whole night where we stayed up and tried to uncover some dark shit that happened in my past) but my job currently has us long distance which makes today’s events all the more difficult. 

my egg donor has been blocked on my previous phone since about may of this year. my dad has reached out rather inconsistently to talk to me here or there. it’s far from unusual for me to go for a couple months without talking to him, as from around may to the end of july there has been minimal responses. i recently got a new phone. i didn’t tell her or my dad. it’s been exactly three days with this phone. 

i received an email last night that i didn’t see until just now that says:

“(op’s birthname/deadname):

I hope all is well. Your father tells me you are very busy. 

We have been trying to reach you and you are not responding to calls or texts. It looks like some of the texts are not being delivered. First, it worries us when you don't respond, and it causes us to be concerned that something may have happened to you. I would like for us to be able to check on your safety and also contact you in case of an emergency. PLEASE CONTACT US TO LET US KNOW YOU ARE SAFE.  Are you willing to do this?

Also, based on what we see on our account from AT&T it looks like you are no longer using your phone. Again, this causes me to worry and wonder if you are ok. Or, it may indicate that you have your own phone plan and no longer wish to be part of the Family Plan. If this is the case, PLEASE LET US KNOW ASAP.  We will need to update our account. (younger brother) is in need of a phone now because of all the traveling he will be doing with soccer. If you are not using our plan, we will add (younger brother) in your place. 

Finally, if you have a new phone number are you willing to give it to us? Again, I would like to be able to contact you in case of emergency. 

Again, I hope you are safe and well. I am here whenever you are ready to reach out.”

ohhh boy. oh boy. oh boy. 

i don’t even have the proper mental capacity to analyze and respond to every part of this email. my brain has been absolutely fried from work (70+ hours a week/no days off), stresses of moving into a new place (my entire front room is FILLED with boxes), and adding this on top of my already fragile mental state doesn’t exactly help matters. 

i know it appears like she’s just sending a casual email worried about a child, but there’s reasons she got blocked and i packed up and left with someone i didn’t know too well to a city i had never been before in the first place. 

how do i respond? do i respond? i don’t know what to do but i do know i feel sick to my stomach right now. "
39,I've finally snapped and I present you all with the tale of The Filthy Hoarder,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb3920898>,Mortuaryfaerie,0,12,9,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536096132.0,9czv3l,"I wrote a really long post detailing the last 4 years of my life that I've spent dealing with this demon but my dang phone crashed while I was writing it. So I'm just going to give a summary and maybe later after work I'll give the details.

To explain her nickname, The Filthy Hoarders house is absolute squaler. Her bathroom floor is rotted out so bad that it's caved in and been replaced by a 2 by 4, there's a pile of rotted food on her table that she keeps  adding to that's probably about 4 ft tall now, 5 foot tall stacks and pils of trash everywhere in her house to the point you have to walk a certain path to go through it, cans full of grease and oil all over the counter, roaches and bugs and all manner of creatures in it.  But she claims my house is disgusting solely because my dog lives inside.

Over the last 4 years she's thrown food on my apartment floor, gone through my medication and belongings, mocked me for being goth, tried for force me to eat pork (I'm Jewish and a pescetarian), belittled me for not having a job immediately upon moving cross country, then tried to force me to quit my job when I got one, mocks me for being infertile, tells me that becoming Christian will cure my infertility,  caused me to have to go to the ER by preventing me from eating for a day and causing my blood sugar to plummet,  would come into my new house and take down things like curtains that I bought and replace them with ratty smelly dirty old ones, leaves trash all over my house, etc.

So yesterday he invited her over for labor day.  It had me so stressed I thought I was having a stroke.  First of all they were supposed to be over by 2 at the latest. When it's 2:45 and they're not there yet I was already sure of the day I was about to have.

They finally show, it's TFH, his nephew B (3 yrs old) and his cousin K (12 years old).  I tell K not to approach my dog yet because my dog is very fearful and shy. TFH immediately pushes K to my dog then flips at me because my dog  growled. I also caught TFH smacking and pushing my dog a few times through the day.  BF was having to hold me back because I genuinely intended to smack the shit out of her for it.  I repeatedly had to correct B because she was letting him run wild, but then she'd tell him not to listen to the ""mean girl"".  At one point I got frustrated because he was standing on my couch with his shoes on (which ended up staining it) and I gently picked him up and removed him from my couch. She FREAKED out and said I was assaulting him. 

So then it came time for food.  We only currently have two chairs at our table so I let her and him have the chairs and told B and K to sit on the floor. TFH then sat on my couch and started eating.  And took her ENTIRE PIECE OF BBQ CHICKEN AND PUT IT ON MY COUCH CUSHION. So I got up and went into the bathroom and told BF I was taking a bath to calm down.  

About a half hour later she comes CHARGING IN TO MY BATHROOM where I'm nude in the tub, and starts lecturing me about how awful I am for about 10 minutes before finally having mercy and getting out of my house"
40,Living with MIL coming to an end.,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb3906160>,alienschool,0,16,11,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536091572.0,9cz7hh,"So I've lived with MIL for about 2 years and pay market rate for a room with other people's shit in it and the washer and dryer, resulting in minimal amounts of privacy. 

I have so many fond memories such as peeing in a bucket when someone decides to close the bathroom door while brushing their teeth or getting dressed resulting in my having bladder problems, having my personal items rummaged through and taken, my MIL yelling at me, MIL talking about white trash specifically while I'm in the room, and MIL having DH lie to his uncle so she could get some of DH's college money for who knows what, but WAIT! There's more! I've written and erased so many potential posts regarding living with her and my two BILs, one SIL, and DH.

Now things are finally coming to an end and we're getting our own apartment. I can finally rest easy, maybe put on some of the weight I lost due to stress, and finally get the privacy to have sex with my husband without MIL banging on the door to tell him that he left his mail on the kitchen table at 10:00 at night. Sweet, sweet memories.

One final nail in the coffin, MIL refuses to let DH take the one item he received from his GM when she was moved to assisted living. A nice wood desk. She says that she'll take it to us when it's the ""right time"". She says the crime rate is high where we're moving. It's my hometown. I've gotten more things taken and destroyed at her house than any other place from her and SIL. Needless to say, it's a bunch of horse shit and I know it has to be a final ploy for power over him. I don't want her to visit, neither does he. I don't want to ever give her our new address. Don't think he cares if she ever gets it. But fuck, I'm fuming over the desk thing. She always has to take everything good and turn it against us. DH says fuck it, he doesn't want it anymore, which yeah, it cuts off her way in to his life. But I just can't fucking let this go. Like, it's his decision to take the desk or not and I tell him that his grandma and uncle want him to have it and she got all of GM's other furniture. Why can't she let him have one goddamn thing? She takes and takes. Money and favors and dignity and everything she can get her greedy idiot hands on, but nothing good comes from it because she's just a miserable person and is never satisfied.

I just feel so angry. I fucking hate it. I want so desperately to make a giant stink in the end and just school her on how awful she is. So far, the best I can think to say without having flying monkeys is just to tell her how happy our lives will be without her. I just hope NC will be enough for me at this point. I know she's trying to be manipulative with the desk but FUCK. I hate that she always feels like she wins and everybody bends over backwards to please her.

Advice is appreciated. I'm just so damn done with this bitch."
41,We didn’t tell JNMIL we were in town visiting (purposefully).... obviously she found out....,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfacebec50>,littlebritney,0,88,183,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536037206.0,9csl2n,"So this weekend we went back home (we moved away 2 years ago same with other siblings) and we didn’t tell her because in the last two years, we always have to see her when we make a trip back. It’s been very taxing on us because she monopolizes our time and cries. 

So DH and I have made it a point to make trips for specific reasons, like family functions or to see specific ppl, so we don’t get caught in JNMIL monopolizing trap. This time, we were back for friends.

She found out we were in town. She texted and said “had no idea you were here let’s meet up if you can.... but if you’re busy I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND :) “.

So naturally we dodged that bullet and told her we’d see what we could do but we didn’t think we’d make it to her place this visit (which is cool cause we literally saw her last weekend we rented a cottage with her and spent all our time with her). 

Anyways I’m sure you can guess what happened. She texted me the day we were leaving and was super bitchy that we didn’t see her. I tried to no JADE but apparently I’m bad at actually knowing how to do that... told her “you said you understood so I don’t know where this is coming from” and “if it makes you feel better we didn’t stop in to see my own mother either!”

Needless to say. She lost her shit.

This all stemmed because my SIL’s mom asked us to go for coffee over fbook, which is how JNMIL found out about us being there in the first place and she was mad we made time for SILs mom but not her ... but as I mentioned we just spent an entire weekend with JNMIL.

My SIL said we should cancel with her mom and go see JNMIL.... I said absolutely not.!!! That’s what she wants. And if she thinks I’m going to completely change my plans for her because she pitches a fit (old behaviours) well she’s wrong.

I’m so tired of her. If we tell her we are in town she expects a visit. If we lie, we always get caught and she freaks. If we are 100% honest and say “we are here but we aren’t seeing you” she’s pissed that we isolated her. ....In two years I’ve been to see her EVERY SINGLE VISIT. It would be different if she just let us pop in, but nooooooooooo!!! She always has to monopolize our time when we are there. If we make plans to spend 2 days with her and 1 day with others she cries and is like you never make time for me, which prevents us from seeing my family and our friends.

I know the approach could have been better. But there is literally no winning with her. NO MATTER WHAT we do, if we don’t devote all our attention to her when we visit, she’s mad."
42,"Introducing Hagda, or, Be Gentle with the Piñata",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb35cde48>,LikeItSounds,0,34,323,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536024509.0,9cr79b,"Hi there! I'm really glad I found this forum. This is my first post.

I have a jnmil. She is the worst. Right now I'm calling her Hagda, bc it works w/her name and she's a total hag, but I'm open to suggestions if we find something better. 

I'm sure at some point I'll be able to regale everyone with lots of flashback stories about Hagda, but today I'm going to introduce us with a story about YS's bday party. Also I have a serious case of sailor mouth, so, there's that.
The YS-bday-specific drama started six weeks ago, which isn't unusual for Hagda. Every year she has somewhere better to be than her 2nd gson's bday party, and every year I say in somewhat nicer terms, ""Go to your fucking lake house if that's really where you need to be while everyone else in your gene pool plus spouses is busy enjoying chocolate cake and not being an asshole."" Yeah, I know--YS's bday is always Labor Day weekend, but Hagda never misses OS's Memorial Day weekend bday, plus she's spent the last ten years boo-hooing out her vagina bc YS wasn't a girl, so she can eat a bag of dicks--I'm not accommodating her bullshit Labor Day weekend lake house desires. 

The story of what she had planned for this weekend instead of being a not-shitty grandmother deserves its own post, so I'll just say that DH put things to rights, secured Hagda's presence at the party (bc her not coming wouldn't be an option, we would have to reschedule hahahahaibustedasphincter), and we enjoyed about five weeks of relative peace and quiet, which came to a screeching but predictable halt about a week before the party.

There was lots of fuckery during this week, the prizewinner involving a piñata taller than YS himself which I feel she bought so as to be the center of attention at my mom's house (we did two parties bc my mom is in the advanced stages of cardiomyopathy, her heart functions at less than 20%, she tires easily, and my niece is also turning 1 so my sis and I decided to combine and take the party to mom, and Hagda insisted we take this gigantic piece of crepe-paper fuck-you trash to my mom's. We didn't.). There's plenty backstory about Hagda needing to be Important and Revered At a Gathering, and the gift of a large Pikachu piñata was suspicious in the extreme (her gifts are often Trojan Horses--stuffed to the gills with hidden agendas and self-serving motives).

Then there was today.

At our house today, there were thirteen adults, one teenager, one ten-year-old, two toddlers, and an infant. Hagda displayed less self-control than either one of the toddlers. That is not an exaggeration. During the three-hour affair, I did not once hear anyone call the toddlers down for the following: yelling; interrupting; shout-talking; being rude; meddling; ignoring repeated requests/commands to stop doing something; not keeping hands to self; taking something away from another kid and breaking it. I heard multiple people getting after Hagda for all these things at least once, and also witnessed each one of them myself. It is so very sad when a grown-ass woman does not have the self-control of a two year old.

The crowning moment was when the kids were outside for piñata time, a second small one she bought just for this party. She's micromanaging every aspect: where the kids should stand, who should go in what order, why the younger toddler should get over it and hit the piñata even though he didn't want to, blindfold--no wait, no blindfold--oh do you have the blindfold I told you to get? She's pissing off people left and right; the mom of the scared toddler is speechless with anger, DH is telling her to get her shit under control, no one is having fun. She's berating YS bc he's hitting his own piñata too hard, but while she's ranting about him being ""gentle with the piñata,"" she yanks the rope so hard that the piñata goes flying up, hits the wooden beam it was hanging from, detaches from the rope and falls to the ground. So YS sees his opportunity and starts whacking the piñata while it's laying there, everyone is cheering, finally we're doing what you're supposed to do with a fucking piñata, and that's when Hagda charges right in as YS is swinging the huge wooden sword we were using for a stick, pushes him aside, grabs the piñata, tears it open with her bare hands, and spills the candy all over the ground. SHE COULDN'T EVEN LET A TEN-YEAR-OLD BREAK A FUCKING PINATA HIMSELF. No. SHE had to do it. Everyone was aghast. The kids had to be encouraged to go pick up the candy bc no one knew what the hell was going on.

And that is my jnmil. Hagda. You haven't heard the last of her, llamas and bastards.

43,A short tidbit,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb35be9e8>,Mistress_Jedana,0,14,60,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536057614.0,9cugkr,"So, JNMiL and I were sitting on the couch yesterday.   DH was napping, and she was watching one of those baking contest shows (one that had already run, and the channel was just running the whole series again).  I was sitting there, playing on my Kindle (Fairway Solitaire).   We're talking a little about this and that, and the baking show...and somehow, we got on the subject of mother in laws.    


She started talking about how her MIL would come over and wax her hardwood floors, and then the kids would put on socks, and slide around to buff it.  (Spoiler:  DH says that didn't happen, that MIL did her own waxing but they did sock buff it after.)   She was also going on about how her MIL would come cook for them and if she didn't like it, she'd still eat it to be polite.    


I say 'well, I haven't ever had a MIL that would come over and clean up or cook.  Besides, I don't need anyone to keep up on my house, I do just fine on my own...as long as I don't have to wait on people to get up so I don't have to worry about noise waking them up.'  (small dig at her, as she got her ass out of bed at 12:30 yesterday...yes, while we were eating lunch.  Waiting to come out until after we had already cooked and were eating.  I did get up to throw a hot dog on her, and I did warm her bun like I did DS's, but I did not make it for her.  I don't make them for my 14 year old son, I'm not making her food for her.)   \[side note:  Johnsonville makes these sweet and spicy sausages...OMG.  DH and I will eat the hell out of those.  Some garlic aoili mustard from Walmart, dill pickles and a good crusty roll...mmmmmmmmmmm\]    


Then she starts 'I would never disrespect my MIL. I always talked to her with respect and about her with respect.  I would never say anything bad about her to nobody.  I was raised to respect my elders.'  


I looked her right in the eye, and said 'well, my former MIL is a cunt who deserves nothing but my loathing...and in my world, you earn your respect.  Age has nothing to do with it.'   And I went back to my game.    


She said nothing else to me until DH got up from his nap thirty minutes later.

44,FMIL and the car - an uneventful update.,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb35c5438>,NoddyBowWow,0,11,70,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536053159.0,9cu19c,"So FDH and I timed it perfectly to where they would not be home when we went to pick it up. So that being said, let's get down to this bitch and her JustNo status.

My first encounter with her was when me and FDH were first dating, and I was being insecure about something and walked outside to have a cigarette. FMIL comes out, unbeknownst to FDH and tells me ""He is NOT cheating on you. My boy does not do that!"" (Arguement wasnt even about that, and I'm also FDH's first relationship. So, um, what?) I just said ""Okay."" and took another drag of my cigarette. Nothing too justno, but a little weird.

Enter FBIL and his (at the time) soon to be wife. I probably owe them my life, because while FBIL is MIL's minion, I got to witness from the start what type of person she was. 

FBIL's wife is a fucking bitch. She is only with FBIL because she is from Cambodia and wants her citizenship. She cheated on FBIL and their child isn't even his. She has told FBIL that she is leaving the moment their child doesn't need to be breastfed. She takes all his money and demands he works three jobs. The bitch needs to be deported.

.......according to FMIL. 

These two are literally the cutest, his wife is the sweetest, and it is obvious just by looking at them how much they love eachother.

I'll admit, I was on the ""just wants her green card"" train for a bit; until I met her and them together. So, I had the heads up that FMIL does NOT like her sons to be taken from her.

She pretty much adored me, up until the moment FDH said we were moving in together. I wasn't privy to it at the time, but she was slowly taking jabs to manipulate FDH to come home. 

-side note- I have never met somebody so preoccupied with other people's finances. She would bring my family up, almost innocently, and then segue into their/our financial situation. For example: my dad has had both knees replaced, multiple back surgeries, and is pretty immobile. So my parents have been looking at new houses. Houses that are not 6 bedroom, 4 bath, and three stories like their current home. FMIL: ""Ha. Yeah, that's what happens when you think you have more money than you do. Guess it's better than foreclosure"" This was relayed to be from FDH, otherwise I would have pointed out the fact that they are currently living in a trailer that they purchased for $2,000 and is being held together by duct tape, while my parents are about to close on a $600k home in a gated community that just so happens to be one-story so my dad can easily move around the house. - but I digress.

So, this all came to a head recently and I probably went nuclear way too quickly.
The financing company was willing to settle with us for a lesser amount, but FDH isnt the greatest at remembering dates. So he couldn't remember the date the payment was due. Well, I taught him a year or so ago to always record his phone calls. The call to the bank was made at work- no recording. But he did call his mom right after to tell her. So he said to just figure out what he told her.

Well, I guess FDH has a terrible memory in general, because he apparently didn't remember his mother saying that I was the reason for their financial troubles, and if he would have listened to her then they wouldn't be in this situation.

Say what? So, I go into my crazy girlfriend mode and listen to more calls. Every single one included some sort of jab at me, my family, or decisions I've made. And I can't even explain how covert they were, it was obviously her trying to subtly turn him.away from me.

The moment I heard that, coupled with the knowledge about FBIL and wife, I told FDH he had a choice. Either put that bitch in her place or leave. He apparently made his own option and just went NC until the car thing yesterday.

The entire time of NC, he was starting to open up about her treatment of him. He was having trouble with wondering if maybe it wasn't true. I just provided him with as many resources I could and cuddles and love. He is livid now, I'm going to beg my therapist to have his colleague make his appointment sooner.

Oh, and because this just blows my mind the most: we don't know where his dad stands about any of this. Because he is deaf. And FMIL refused to allow FDH to learn ASL. 

Chew on that one."
45,CleanFreak: NO PDAs! And why do you never kiss us goodnight?,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb37a68d0>,TheFilthyDIL,0,33,773,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536005970.0,9coucf,"​ETA: This was more than 40 years ago, and CleanFreak is long dead. 

CleanFreak was . . . weird when it came to Public Displays of Affection.  On our first visit there we were still in the newlywed phase, as our second anniversary was still on the horizon.  So we were (and still are) physically demonstrative.  I’m not talking about lap dances and tonsil cleaning, but loving pats and touches and quick kisses.

I was sitting on the couch at the PIL’s house when DH walked past.  I patted him on the butt and he leaned down for a kiss.

CleanFreak hit the ceiling.  “WHY DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BE PAWING AT HIM?!?  **DECENT** PEOPLE DON’T DO THAT IN PUBLIC!!”

Me: “Because we love each other.  My parents still kiss and touch each other all the time.  Don’t you?”  (Incidentally, my parents still affectionately kissed and touched after 70 years of marriage.)

​CleanFreak: “WHERE THE H-E-DOUBLE HOCKEYSTICKS DO YOU COME OFF CLAIMING THAT BECAUSE WE DON’T GROPE EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME, THAT MEANS WE DON’T LOVE EACH OTHER?!?!  THAT WE HATE EACH OTHER?!?”

​I JADEed.  DH JADEed.  I don’t remember any resolution to the “discussion,” if any.  CleanFreak was adamant that I said they must hate each other.

​But the next night, ah, the next night – bedtime came (thank Goddess!) I said goodnight and started to go up the stairs.

​CleanFreak: “Aren’t you forgetting something?”

​Me: “Did I only think that I said goodnight?  Because if I didn’t say it out loud, I apologize. Goodnight.”

​CF: “YOU DIDN’T KISS US GOODNIGHT!!  YOU NEVER DO!! **IS THAT ANY WAY TO TREAT YOUR PARENTS?”**

​Me: ""You aren't MY parents.  And I stopped kissing MY parents goodnight when I was about 10.  I don’t intend to kiss you and Dad, not after that fit you threw yesterday.  GOOD. NIGHT.”  And I went upstairs to bed.  IIRC, she complained loudly about it, but what could she do, other than add to her increasing catalog of Butt-Hurt Reasons to Hate Her Awful DIL?"
46,HTF do I negotiate the holidays with JNMIL...,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb358c7b8>,TenaciousTapir,0,22,12,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536087679.0,9cyn89,"My (24F) SO (29M) and I have been dating for a year and a half and living together for just over a year now. We’re not in a rush to get married but know we will someday. 

My SO and I are generally on the same page when it comes to our families. Mine is great to be around and we spent 10 days last Christmas break living at my parents and would do it again no problem. His family is boring, we don’t share any common interests with them (and our attempts to do things we think his mom would enjoy usually fall flat/are under appreciated), they are not warm or expressive and conversations rarely go beyond small talk. 

So last year, we were living an airplane ride away and my sister and mom came to visit us for thanksgiving and we had a fantastic time. For Christmas break, we drove 14hrs home (our families live 45 miles apart), stayed 10ish nights with my family and 3 days total but only 1 night with his. We spent Christmas Eve and morning with his family and headed over to my family’s around 1pm to do Christmas “morning” with them and then dinner. We enjoy the time with my family much more and both feel like we are doing what we’re obligated to do around his fam. I encouraged him to plan a few more nights we could spend at his parents so they didn’t feel like we were spending all our time at my fam’s but he didn’t, which was fine until when we came over for a day before we were making the long drive back, JNMIL made a comment about how we didn’t split time very equally. Gahhhh! SO did nothing to make it clear that that wasn’t my fault, but I think he knows to next time. 

Anyways, that brings me to the advice part. We’ve recently started talking about how we’re going to break up the holidays this year. SO and I now live 2-3 hr drive away from our parents and my sister and some of my extended fam live in the same city we’re in. We will likely have thanksgiving with my family, but I think JNMIL will be offended by this because it’s my BILs year to be at her place with his wife + daughters. 
I have no idea what we’re doing about Christmas this year yet. We just have so much more fun with my family. 

I’m just looking for stories and advice from people who split holidays (50/50 or a less even split) and how to do this without pissing off in laws who refuse to talk about what they want and prefer to be passive aggressive. "
47,PlantageNOT: the BEC files,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb357ada0>,NotFuckingWarren,0,25,152,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536035221.0,9csdw1,"Hey Llamas!  This is mainly some weird & BEC stuff, all leading up to the big blowout.  Standard disclaimers apply.  We are super NC.  See BB for previous crazy.

So when we last left off, PlantageNOT tried to be all Gollum about FIL's dress clothes and acted like the nasty, spiteful person she is and we had a baby shower in the midst of a family tragedy.  These moments take place in the month that followed: 

-The dueling phone calls continued, with a twist:  now PlantageNOT wanted to make DH the beneficiary of her life insurance policy.  All she needed was his SSN.  

Um, NOOOO.

-FIL gets wind of this (don't know how) and ups the ante: he wants to make the baby his beneficiary.  That is still inside me.  Then he couldn't understand why this wasn't possible. (Not that we would have gone for it anyway).

-Conversations start about holidays.  We tell both that we will split them.  FIL gets Thanksgiving,  PlantageNOT can come on Christmas Day afternoon  (cause you aren't fucking up my Doctor Who Christmas episode, I don't care who you are).   Both were pissy because we should leave the other out and give them allll the holidays because the other sucks.  

Seriously?  How about you both suck and we just dip the fuck out?  Yeah, thought so.

- Then we get to the main event:  who gets to come to the hospital after DD is born (at what time).  Now again, I will give PlantageNOT this.  She never tried to be there while I was in labor in any capacity.  (Small favors to your deity of choice, right?)  But we did have their RO to consider when it came to visiting, and she was insistent that she be there before FIL.  

Luckily, FIL was respectful of us from jump and had suggested he come the day after.  He did act like an ass that day...but that's a mention for the comments should anyone care to hear.

Summer turned into fall and the big day arrived.  After a fashion, DD made her appearance.  Now, I had made a special card for DH to keep in his wallet for the big day.  It was a list of which friends to call, which friends to text, and when for when we went to the hospital (we have a good sized circle of friends that have become our family, both in and out of state).  At the bottom of this card, it said: 

""Call your family at your discretion.""

Note:  Just so everyone understands, (and because it is about to come into play) my choice of wording is simply how I speak, and it was a wallet sized card.  So I kept it simple. DH and I had previously discussed what I wanted and he was in total agreement.  The card was a reminder because 1st baby and shit gets hectic.

No big deal, right?  Ha!  Sure, keep dreaming.  

I do my thing, DH does his thing (and is fucking amazing), the doc does his thing.  DD checks out and we are having cuddle time while I finish my bag of pitocin and get some feeling back in my legs (thank Glob for epidurals, ya'll, 46 hours from start to finish is a BITCH).  My best friend is there, and DH asks if PlantageNOT,  Sibling and Sibling's SO can come in.  I say sure, everyone is cool and DD is passed around (with my consent).  It really was ok!  Then, DH gets the card out to make the last round of calls/texts and Sibling and SSO offer to help.  DH hands over the card, it gets done.  Again, everything seems fine. 

Fast forward to a few days later.  PlantageNOT comes to visit us at the house.  And that's when the other shoe drops.  Turns out they were hurt by me writing 'at your discretion' on the fucking card.  Why?  No idea to this day.  Just didn't like the word choice. 

Now, I couldn't believe that Sibling and SSO would give a flying fuck about something so trivial, nor would they take issue with the notion that it was DH's prerogative when he called his family. 

 Time would tell on that issue."
48,Intro to Giggles: light Boundary Pusher has stepped up to her first full CBF,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb35b5ac8>,Agile_Strawberry,0,8,16,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536079469.0,9cxdvr,"Obligatory on mobile disclaimer. Have posted before, but with a different account. Going to keep this one for all related things, and start diving into the stories.

I was going to originally start with stories of my JNM, but this weekend, my FMIL decided to step up. She's been a boundary pusher previously, but more in the asking if you want a glass of water, you say no, and she brings you one anyways. The harmless kind that you make note of, but it's not worth fighting at all. She's got a bad case of babies rabies, and I'll share a store about shutting that down (which clearly only worked for a while) later. But onto the story. Due to her normal behaviour when boundary pushing, I shall give her the name of Giggles.

Quick background: FH (he doesn't get to be called dear for this story) and I have been together for 8+ years, engaged for 2.5 years. We had some paperwork problems (JNM caused - story for another day), so we haven't been able to do the thing yet, but just got it sorted so can officially start planning. We do want kids, but aren't in any rush. I also have a family history of having a hard time conceiving, and just went through an early miscarriage just over a month ago, on my birthday to boot. So I'm extra sensitive to baby things, and FH knows this… FH is also deep in the FOG.

The scene: we're at JNMIL’s place. I'm on the couch beside her, FH is sitting in a chair across from us and FSFIL (future step father in law) is sitting in his recliner. Convo is small talk things, and I'm more or less a grey rock of answers (also because life is rather quiet, so there really isn't much to say). 

Giggles (leaning over to me): so when do I get grandbabies? (With an accompanying giggle)
Me: You know we want to get married first. (And then I turned back to the main conversation because I am not dealing with this right now. We haven't shared with people about the miscarriage mainly because I don't want Giggles to think we are trying.)

Giggles asks if we've found a venue for our wedding yet. I say that it's really hard to find a venue for a small wedding. Her recommendation? We should get married  where she did, and have our reception at the same place too, and we should also do it in the fall like she did. Y'all, the way she said it, with a giggle, it gave me serious Jocasta vibes.

Of course it's at this time that FH decides to make an announcement. He's been on and off about getting a tattoo for years, and he's back to the on of it. He decides he wants to tell his mom, because her reaction will “be funny”. His sister has many small tattoos, so in theory there should be no reaction.

FH: so mom, I wanted to tell you something… (big dramatic pause). I'm…

Giggles grabs my arm. This is it. I know what she's thinking. I know I just said no, but she's ready. I look at FH, shooting thoughts of “say it and don't play with your mom's emotions"". He doesn't. He done gone and messed up big time.

FH: (he's dragging it out for as long as possible). I'm pregnant.

Giggles doesn't hear the I'm, she just heard pregnant and turns to me. I'm blank faced and simply say absolutely not, while shooting daggers at FH. He catches a dagger and says we aren't. He follows it up with saying he's planning on getting a tattoo, specifically a sleeve. 

Giggles starts getting a little bit of a CBF. She does a “but we're faaaaammillyyyy” type of response that he can't get a tattoo. Giggles turns to me, thinking I will talk him out of it, because I'm supposed to be loyal to her wants, and enforce what she thinks is best for her full grown in his 30s son.

Me: FSIL has many. I have one. If he wants one, he can have one. And I'll probably get more too. 

The CBF increases. Suddenly FSFIL asks a question (I think to move it into a more productive direction), and I start answering it. Giggles is not having it, and starts interrupting. She playfully hits my arm and says I'm supposed to be on her side. I keep answering the question (something about motorbikes and tattoos) so she adds that everyone is against her and it's not fair, in the full whinny voice (we all know the voice). I stop my response just long enough for us all the hear that, and then, before continuing, said “I'm just going to ignore that”. Full CBF. 

She tries again to guilt FH into not wanting a tattoo. FSFIL, just keeping the convo going, asks if FH has ridden his bike a lot this summer. Giggles hates that he has a bike. She thinks I shouldn't let him have a bike. And she thinks that even if he has one, I shouldn't let him ride it. I should guilt him whenever he goes for a ride, because she doesn't want him to. 

FH and I spoke about it all on the way home. He apologized for how he did it, but he's deep in the fog still. The amount of times he said “it's just how she is” was ridiculous. He's been officially warned by me to get her under control, especially about babies, because I will not keep having the same conversation. I have even gone so far as to tell him that her obsession with us having kids makes me not excited to get married, because I know the moment we get married she'll start asking again (she's been asking since before we got engaged, so it's been 3+ years of giving her the same answer). He's been warned as well that if she keeps asking, my default answer will be “why are you so obsessed with us having sex”. The good (?) thing is that this was the push I needed to truly look into pre-marital counseling, because he needs to get on my page about boundaries (he's made a few comments that if me and Giggles have problems, it'll be a problem for him, so I want to sort that out before we do the thing to make sure he understands who's side he needs to be on. I'm not asking him to turn on her, just to be an adult, say no, and back me up or buffer.)

49,CryBaby is...Done?,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb359a5f8>,BlueBee773,0,41,524,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536010583.0,9cph24,"Good news, llamas! DD’s first birthday (end of August) has officially come and gone with no real, direct drama from CryBaby. I know it’s not the nom-filled update it could have been, but I’ve never been so content to have nothing major to report. 

DH and I had canvassed possible contact attempts beforehand, having decided after CryBaby tried badmouthing us to my GM that we would not be offering an olive branch in the name of DD’s birthday, and discussed how we would respond to each if they happened, but nothing. Not a card, not a call, not an attempted visit/party crash. We were left alone. DD’s party was beautiful, DD was happy, and we were both able to just enjoy the day with her. 

Now, that’s not to say that CryBaby’s presence (or lack thereof) wasn’t noticeable; it’s just that it was there in ways that didn’t matter to us anymore. YBIL never responded to DH’s text inviting him down for the party, and AIL/CILs never responded to my invitation on Facebook (didn’t really want AIL there anyway, but couldn’t invite CILs without her). With YBIL, we’ve pretty much accepted that he’s taken his mother’s side, even though there is no need for sides, and that we probably will be/have been cut out by him. As far as the AIL/CILs go, we didn’t figure they’d make the trip anyway, as they live a state over, but we didn’t want to hurt CILs’ feelings or feed the “They’ve cut us all out!” narrative by not at least inviting them. 

So anyway, none of them came, but we weren’t really surprised and honestly probably were able to enjoy the party more because of it. The party started, they don’t show, and we didn’t really think about it again, figuring it was reasons stated above. 

But. Then we got home, I put the girl (who is now one, holy crap!) down for a nap, and we found out what had really happened via our Facebook FMs. CryBaby only posted one thing out of the ordinary on DD’s actual birthday, just a quick, “My beautiful granddaughter is turning one today. Happy birthday, DD!” Nothing life shattering, just standard run of the mill attention seeking/pretending for her public that she still sees her GD. The next day (the day of the party she wasn’t invited to), however, she posted a ton of pictures of a birthday party (cake at home, dinner out) for YBIL, featuring herself, GMIL, AIL, and the CILs and the following caption:

>>Celebrating [BIL’s childhood nickname] early. [BIL’s mid-September birthdate] is right around the corner. 

Hm. So the real reason none of them could come to our DD’s first birthday party wasn’t because of distance, but because they were too busy making that same distance to celebrate YBIL’s birthday instead...half a month early and just coincidentally on the same day as the party for DD? Okay. Good to know where we stand, I guess. 

Honestly, we’re not even mad, but I will own to being surprised. Of all the scenarios we had planned for, her throwing a petty revenge party wasn’t one of them, especially since this woman hasn’t done anything for a birthday for either of her sons—cake, party, dinner, etc.—since DH was 16 and even that one he planned for himself. I mean, she’d send money for a gift, but a party, with dinner, cake, and other people? No. Everything nice that was done for DH’s birthdays since we started college was done by me, and she usually didn’t even show up. Which makes us both believe this was just a case of “They’re throwing a party and not inviting me?! Fine! I’ll throw a party and not invite them, plus steal people from their party to come to mine! That’ll show them!” The cake was even themed for our alma mater’s rival school. And really? The whole thing is just...sad. Because this didn’t effect us at all, if that’s what she was hoping for. 

I’m beginning to wonder if it’s finally over, though. The morning of DD’s birthday, CryBaby apparently changed her profile picture from DD (the pic meant to look like DD eating birthday cake, see bot) to one of herself where she’s trying to look younger (think a different style of makeup, Vogue glasses...oddly enough she looks like DH’s last ex in this pic). Then the day of YBIL’s party, she changed her cover picture from one of DD (the one of her in a “party” dress, see bot) to one of YBIL wearing a birthday hat at the restaurant they ate at for his party. 

So she’s officially scrubbed her page of our DD, which is just not normal considering how much she loves using DD for attention fodder. We haven’t heard from her in over a month, and if there was going to be an extinction burst, I was sure it would have been DD’s birthday. I mean, I know her throwing YBIL a party the same day was definitely spiteful, but it wasn’t something that had any direct or real impact on us at all. Could this be it? Is she really giving up and cutting us out? Because, seriously, DH and I can’t come up with a single downside to her “cutting us out,” only things we no longer have to worry about or deal with. Or do you thinking I’m counting my peaceful, drama-free chicks too early?

50,My car accident and fall semester of senior year,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb354ff60>,drowninginhighlight,0,2,14,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536079274.0,9cxcpd,"Not much recent updates on the QGR front. She’s actually been pretty tame/quiet. Actually not being unhelpful about the whole new job stressing me out thing. Still not telling her shit about the “bile/stomach bug” being a panic attack. Maybe once I’ve quit and found a new job. Anyways, I’m here to post about the time I totaled a car and how she treated me for the first six months after.

Now, I’m not here to play the victim or justify anything. I’ll give credit where it’s due, and I do commend QGR for at least not raising me to be a snowflake. As well as being one of those moms that would Bitch slap me inside out if I ever so much as rolled my eyes at her, or spoke to her like a ton of other kids spoke to their parents. But there has to be a line.

So summer 2015, I wanted to be a dentist, and was taking a summer class, while shadowing at a dentist’s office. This one particular day, I was shadowing, after a tumultuous all nighter studying for a test. Now, maybe I shouldn’t have been wearing wedges. Nor should I have used my phone at a red light. Long story short, I made an improper left and this resulted in a head on collision. A week before my 21st.

Initially, QGR and her consort were cool about it, and more relieved that me and the other guy weren’t massively injured. Just some bruises. And they didn’t really want me to regress and lose confidence driving, so they got a rental for a week. But alas, this isn’t a happy story.

The day of my 21st birthday, I had class. Shadowing in the morning, quick lunch, then off to school. Right before shadowing, QGR told me that I totaled the car to get attention on Facebook. Um. I didn’t post shit on Facebook or any social media platform. And if I wanted attention on social media so bad, I’d probably get a super expensive makeover and post some selfies. Not total a car.

Her consort was also joining in the fun too. They’d constantly be up my ass about being on my phone, and he had this new rule in place. All phones in the hall at night. Bitch I use that shit for alarms. The other actual alarm clocks don’t work for shit anymore. And he wanted to fucking walk from the enterprise office back home. Something I was scared to dispute because he often snapped at me about needing to exercise more. OF COURSE I TELL QGR THIS AND SHE SNITCHES AND GETS ME YELLED AT.

Around this time, I also found out that my “friends” couldn’t have given even a marble turd. This after constantly calling and texting about my accident. The mutual friend who informed me was supposed to be my best friend. And she was making excuses for her college crushes, that “they may not want to be friends but they want you to be happy with your other friends!” And “you have all these other friends idk why you think it’s embarrassing.” 

This was also around the time I got an iPhone and decided to share dad’s iCloud. YES I KNOW ROOKIE MISTAKE I DIDNT KNOW HOW IPHONE WORKS. So of course QGR snoops on my texts via his MacBook Pro. And throws them in my face, accusing me of sexual harassment (IT WAS MUTUAL FLIRTING. THANK GOD NO NUDES), and clearly knew about the friends thing. She belittled it indirectly. And called me emotionally unstable, along with a tirade of other things wrong with me. WHYYYYYY WONT YOU TALK TO MEEEEEEEEEE?!

Around the time the semester started, I was defeated. You llamas know the whole all science academic probation junk. This is just the prologue/behind the scenes. I had a new car after Labor Day, and was taking a defensive drivers course to get the two points off my license. But that semester was plagued by untreated depression.

At one point early on, she wanted to take me to a yoga therapist. She wanted to “get to the root of the problem,” and the school counseling center was taking advantage of me (PLEASE ENLIGHTEN ME). She then screams that I’m close-minded. Nah, I just don’t want to do yoga and meditation because you were up my ass about it. So we go to the yoga therapist, and I still hate her for reasons I’m going to detail in this next paragraph.

I told that bitch I didn’t appreciate QGR ending my high school relationship (I’m actually over it now, not sure if I’ll ever make a post about it), because two horny teens were sexting. And how she caused my ex bf to be bitter at me. SHE TOLD QGR. I didn’t find this out till finals, when I spent all night up studying and making a cheat sheet (sanctioned for the exam), and she screamed at me about it when I tiredly told her I guess we’d find out how the final went.

I didn’t know HOW QGR knew until we saw a psychiatrist and she simpered to her about it, and then admitted that she may have spoken to his parents. Or implied it. I know, it’s been 9 years at this point. But it was the principle of the matter. I’m a firm believer that people should fuck up their own relationships. 

It was also around finals week that she was snapping at me for running my mouth and apparently telling people she ruined my life. I mean. I didn’t use those words but sure whatever you wanna believe. She then proceeds to justify her marriage (tainted by her own JNMIL), saying that at least he was only an alcoholic and she stayed because her parents wouldn’t “let” her divorce, and he said he loves his wife and kids. Lol.

That’s pretty much it. At this point, maybe I’ll be posting some stories about my childhood. Not sure how many of those there are, but you llamas will get the scoop as more recent stuff goes down! "

But trying to talk to FH about how his mom and brother have made me feel during the planning process was a disaster. It's starting to feel like the 3 of them against the world, and like somehow I'm creating issues where there are none. How do I approach this without either one of us getting defensive? We can never agree on the fact that his mom is kind of controlling. His dad has straight up said to my dad that she always controlled the boys. How does he not see it? I'm tired of getting the ""mommy knows best"" routine just because she and the other people he grew up with all have this formula for weddings and bridal/baby showers. I told him I was willing to drop things if it was just about cost, but she wanted us to change the veggies and fruits to something else entirely. 

Updated to add: FH and I had a long talk about a lot of the things contributing to this blowup, and he gets why I'm stressed but I think he's frustrated feeling like I'm always ready for a fight with her. You guys won't like this but he was kinda right about that. But I did thoroughly explain how it feels like me vs them and that I get frustrated with being told she knows more. She does but I also had done a ton of research and brainstorming and consulting with others for what I wanted, and I pointed out the only details that have changed have involved his mom or brother. We both agreed we need to be team us and I told him I will happily askfor her or my mom's guidance in life if we have kids but I'm not having any until we have been married awhile and can get him out of the fog. I will be taking the suggestions for counseling for us because I love him dearly and I think he's worth it. And since I only post about negative situations with his mom, I haven't been able to give background on all the times he does stand up for us. I'm also taking someone's suggestion to get his dad involved. I'm hopeful he can help. "

My JYDad and I came up with some together and ended up with Your Song by Elton John. We both are fans of Elton and both love the song so it was perfect. I kind of figured MIL would do something similar with DH.

Nope. She ended up picking some song she has seen someone else share on Facebook. It was a song DH had never heard in full until the mother/son dance. It had zero meaning to them and didn't create a special moment for DH. I should have figured this would happen since DH is not the GC. Here some the lyrics to the song she picked. They make me vomit.

""The day has come to let you go. Only happiness I will show"" Poor, poor MIL can't show how sad she is that DH married and is happy with me

""Nothing takes away my love and it shows. Yeah nothing takes away my love when I let you go"" Ugh, all this talk about ""letting go"". DH was 28 when we got married. We had lived 5 hours way from her for like 6 years at this point

""Cause you’re my baby, always will be"" Blehhhhh. DH might be the youngest but you definitely don't treat him like your baby.

""Some years down the long long road if you need help with your load I’ll always be here for you, you know"" Vomit. MIL will be there for him because obviously me as his wife won't be there for him. Let's not even get into the fact how unsupportive she is of DH now.

Best part of this story? DH was supppppper drunk by the time this dance rolled around and doesn't remember a second of it."
53,Learning what love feels like.,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb3564c50>,loreike,0,3,6,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536087593.0,9cymrn,"Spinning off a ""what narcs say"" thread, yes:
Learning what love feels like is hard especially when your loved one has N-parents and is only halfway done working on his spine.  

He's so conditioned to stand up for family, oir no matter what they do or say to others, or how inconsiderate etc. they are.  I said for example your mom is out of line expecting us to cancel our friends visit we are expecting to come for the weekend, because she wants us to attend an improptu dinner.  Then - I get screamed at ""DON""T YOU BAD MOUTH MY MOM!!!!!"".  
Same thing from SIL1 SIL2, if I say something like, ""that thing your mom is putting together is not going to work"". then I get something like ""NO ONE ASKED YOU!!!!"". And DH jumps on their side gnashing his teeth along with the two sisters he refers to as ""the wolves"" and will start in on the ""and DON""T YOU BAD MOUTH MY MOM!!!!!

I told them all once, you know what, common law DH and I have been together 20 years she's my mom my too.  

But DH at least was trying to teach me to grey-rocking for years.  He'd say,""When we're there for dinner - can't you just be quiet and not say anything?""  

I always thought that was absurd, why would I go somewhere and then act like I'm in high-school detention?  Because JUSTnomil /  family oey.

But now I can grey-rock the shit out of MIL's the shenanigans and I don't even have to go - to the concert for tribute to artist I've never listen too.

Oh, even though concert is 3 days after DH's upcoming birthday there  was no mention of, ""we'll get your ticket for you since it's your birthday and this is my idea."" Nope. And we live out of town and the ticket office is 10 min from their place but not only is the birthday not mentioned she made it DH's responsibility to buy all the tickets, for them, their 4 friends, and throws in as we walk out the door, ""and remember to buy tickets for your sisters!!!

DH was so ticked off because the sisters never have money to apy back anything, even outright small loans. So he didn't buy them for 3 weeks, would not respond to the calls and messages of  ,""remember to get those tickets..."","" it's getting late, the good seats will be gone."" So eventually because the on-line system is such a pain we go to the actual venue and buy the tix on my credit card. Mom leaves message , ""rememeber I only want 6 tickets"". As in, not your sisters, you sort that out.  Total slow burn.
Lately, when we're in the city he'll take a short cut through his old neighbourhood, drive right past their street and says nothing.  I also stay silent.  
Fortunately, (for MIL) she coughed up the money for all the tickets except his.  Oh, and she was really SAD to hear I wqsn't oming.  That's right, I won't expose myself to her or ""the wolves"", unnecessarily, and the concert is on a Monday night and we live 1 1/2 hours away so - I have to get to bed on time for work. At least DH didn't in the least try to get me to go.  Whew.

54,How do you handle knowing there's an 80-99% chance there's going to be a confrontation with your JNM?,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfaceed080>,second_glance,0,11,10,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536084714.0,9cy7u0,"Most of the time I feel like I don't belong here because my JN is my step mother, but I love reading your stories and try to apply the same concepts you use on your inlaws. 

I still attend family events knowing my JNSM will be there because I still very much want to be a part of my family. It seems as though if the event is small enough and she's comfortable with letting her mask slip, there without a doubt will be some form of confrontation. In my ideal world we can attend the same events without interacting and both enjoy our family. For some reason my presence brings out the absolute worst in her.

 This weird dynamic has been going on for well over a year. Sometimes she's okay with us being near eachother, she just ignores me or makes faces while I talk or rolls her eyes, but other times she tries to make other people believe I want to kick her out of her home and refuse to be places if she's there, to me she plays the victim hardcore and makes up lies before events, but then when we're around eachother she gets super aggressive. 

This last time was my own fault. She was pouting off by herself shaking her leg and head and I walked up to her and asked her to come hangout with the family. My intentions were to extend an olive branch and even though the group is small we can still be around others. 

Idk what I do that triggers her so bad, but when I'm not physically present she puts on a show (especially on facebook) like there is nothing going on between us. But behind the scenes she is bashing me and playing victim, it's gotten so bad one of my sisters kids, I repeat, kids, wrote her a letter about her behaviors including how she bad mouths me. 

So I know that this cycle is just life for now until either she accepts that we can both enjoy our family or I stop attending small events with her present (which causes even more drama with others). 

So JNMil, any and all advice is greatly appreciated. How do you handle going into an event that you know will more than likely involve a confrontation or drama? Most of the time I break out in hives from the stress of it. "
55,MIL hyjacks Christmas plans. Why are men so blind to their mommies?,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb3305cf8>,kerryap,0,22,80,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536038593.0,9csq1f,"As I’m posting on JustNoMIL safe guess I’m not a fan of mine and she’s racked up some very bad behavior in the 4 years I’ve been married to my husband. Had she lived in the country while we’d been dating I’m convinced we would never have gotten engaged let alone married. The last four years have been a roller coaster of stress and frustration at both her behavior and my husband’s short memory and increasingly creative ways to dismiss her behavior as less than it is. 

Finally two years ago things escalated and I finally refused to be in the same room with her. She’s insulted me to my face, tried to slam my hand in the dishwasher, meddled in my marriage (including snooping in our bedroom and even IN our BED) and all around made life miserable. 

The no contact was short lived. DH insisted he wanted “family” to be together for Christmas. I relented with the condition that it would be on neutral territory. I was not going to her home (seat of power) nor letting her in my home. The idea of trying to prevent her from snooping again or worse getting her out of my house when I’d reached my max was a firm No Go. Christmas 2017 was spent at Whistler. The location had something for everyone adult or toddler. Everyone stayed several days, Christmas was bearable. 

I did not however like planning last minute, nor paying last minute prices and insisted we book with more notice for 2018. Upon departing I suggested to all parties Hawaii, any thoughts. To my face MIL was agreeable. My husband has observed me plan, list build, research and all but book this even for 9 months. Now I’m insisting we book. Upon sharing the plan with MIL husband comes back with following text “Mom would rather spend her birthday (Jan 25th) in Hawaii. How about we go to Boston instead.” 

We have a 3year old and my last recollection of Boston was a very adult town. But the suggested alternative location is beside the point. DH was shocked when I didn’t really think this was a swell idea. **Why are men so stupid about their mommies**. If this had come from anyone else he would have caught it a mile off. “I have decided on Hawaii for my birthday so you can’t go for Christmas.” Come on dude this is rude!!!! "
56,Because 2am is an excellent time to ask your child a question,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb31c44e0>,crazyspottedcatlady,0,4,25,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536059906.0,9cuopp,"A bit of context is required for this one, because it involves the cousin of my mother's first sister. Said sister was a little shit as a kid and forever telling lies and setting her siblings up to get them in trouble with their parents. My grandma caught her one day inflicting injuries on herself (not major - think something like a rug burn) which she claimed her brothers had inflicted, not knowing grandma had seen her doing it to herself.  This was in the day where Feet Didn't Touch if you misbehaved so you can imagine how that worked out for her. My grandma never did believe a word that came out of her mouth afterwards.

Now my mom is well established as being nocturnal. She's never out of bed before 12pm and even that's pushing it. This results in her being up all night, which is also important.

My aunt had three children but her youngest was the only girl. My mom occasionally babysat the girl for her (this was also the only *socialisation* I received as a child) and she would ""play"" with me (read: be a little shit until she got her own way). This occasion was one of those times.  At the time, she was sitting on the floor in front of the desk I was sitting at colouring, watching the TV. As they tend to do when put down carelessly by a young child, one of my crayons rolled off the edge of the desk and bonked her on the head.  She wasn't upset at the time, and handed me my crayon back, and that was it as far as I was concerned.

Until 2am that morning, when my mother dragged me out of bed. I'm confused, tired and scared because if looks could kill, she'd be childless.  She demands to know if I had bullied my cousin.

Yes, my auntie called her later that evening and apparently my cousin had told a tale about how I kept hitting her in the head with my crayons on purpose.

My mother waited until 2am so she could drag me out of bed and scare the crap out of me to accuse me of bullying my cousin.  Who was very much her mother's double and well known for telling tall tales just like her mother.

In fairness, I wouldn't be angry about this looking back if she hadn't *waited until 2am* to ask me about it, thus disturbing my sleep. She had a damn good idea that these accusations were false anyway, and when she went back to my auntie to tell her my cousin was a lying little shit, she even pointed out the hundreds of times my auntie had *told lies to get her in trouble with their parents* before now as to why her precious little angel would lie about me throwing crayons at her!

The upside was said cousin wasn't allowed to come over any more, which as you can imagine was no great loss to me.  As far as I'm aware, she's grown up considerably and has a family of her own now, but we're NC because of this incident.

An update on the health stuff also touched upon on the last post: I know full well that I have FM's in the family.  I'm not too concerned because I simply don't share anything I'm not okay with eventually making its way back to my mom.  In any case, I have been diagnosed recently with a condition that can either be a standalone ailment, or a symptom of two or three other, more severe ailments, so the current plan is to treat it as if it were the standalone ailment for now and see if it improves - if not, then we dig deeper.  This means I've currently got a splint on the affected limb.

My mom's input, on learning that I had this condition, which is absolutely NOTHING to do with genetics: ""The wrists in this family have always been weak!"" The only history of anything remotely similar in my family is a case of repetitive strain injury, which is not even close to what I have been assessed with.  NC and I still can't be ill, apparently."
57,The Wedding Outfits,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb3574710>,likeursoperfect,0,15,95,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536031178.0,9crytc,"This is just a tiny blurb. DH and I have been reading a lot of the worst of the worst sagas. Wearing white to the wedding is a running theme here, as you know. 

Neither of us could remember for sure what our moms wore to our wedding, so we pulled out our wedding album. My mother wore ivory, MIL wore champagne. Not like a little bit, but their dresses were solid colored, my mother’s had beading, and neither of them ever wore their dresses again. (My mother also wore white to my sister’s wedding, and MIL wore off-white to BIL’s wedding, but not to SIL’s.) 

My mom and MIL compete over absolutely everything and are passive aggressive AF. It’s like a constant duel between them. MIL takes great joy in the fact that she beats my mom solidly whenever cost is involved, and my mom spends a lot of money trying to outdo her, anyway. I really didn’t think anything of it at the time, and I didn’t remember what they wore, but of course it was shades of white. "
58,Advice on rude remarks?,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfaced4780>,OrdinaryMouse2,0,8,8,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536076350.0,9cwvk7,"JNMom constantly talks shit about people behind their backs. It doesn't matter who they are - she does this with literally everyone. It's generally really gross, uncomfortable triangulation. 

(Actual examples: A classmate's mom is on disability because she's so fat and lazy, how gross and lazy! Your cousin's parents think she's smart but she's really, well, *average at best*. I can't believe anyone would give their kid Ritalin, they obviously just want to make medicated zombies. Your father is so irresponsible and leaves me alone all the time, because he visits friends once or twice a week. Your cousins obviously only went to college to get their ""MRS"" degree.)

Obviously, JNMom tries to sabotage all relationships that aren't with her, and she also demonstrates her behavioral expectations for her children by shit-talking anyone who doesn't meet those (ridiculous) standards.

(And yes, she shit-talks me too, both to my face and behind my back. She's fond of """"honest"""" things like telling me I smell bad, that I'm too fat for a swimsuit, that my hair makes me look like a dyke, etc. I'm not sure what she says behind my back, but I'm sure it's not good.)

I generally grey-rock her, along the lines of ""I'm sure they're fine, Mom -\_\_\_-"". She's a narcissist, so trying to convince her of anything is a pointless endeavor, including ""you're being a dick and need to stop."" (Believe me, I've tried.)

We're already LC, going VLC as I move across the country.

This being said... folks, do you have any thoughts on the best line between information and discretion? 

I don't want to hurt people, especially my significant others, by passing on her toxic bullshit. But I also don't want to keep my mother's secrets or be complicit in her gross secret triangulation. My inclination has usually been to tell people what she's saying about them if they have any ongoing relationship with her, because... I guess I'd rather know if it were me. But... I don't know if that's necessarily the best course of action."
59,Darth Potter has returned,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb31be400>,Peppermint_Panda88,0,23,415,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536001743.0,9co989,"It's been just over one very blissful, quiet, drama-free month since we went NC with Darth Potter. Maybe she's changed, maybe she's learning to respect our boundaries. Or maybe she was just waiting for the perfect moment to crash back into our lives. And maybe, just maybe, she decided that perfect moment was yesterday, during my best friends baby shower.

That's right llamas! Darth Potter crashed a baby shower! But at least it's a shower for people she's friends with right? Wrong! She's met this couple once, and afterwards let everyone know how ""disgusting"" they were in ""the eyes of the lord"" because in Darth Potter's mind if you're gay then you're damned, unless you're on Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. 

How'd she even get in you ask? Poor shitty timing! See, I realized pretty late into setting up  that we wouldn't have enough food, and so took it upon myself to leave and get more. I knew I would be getting back after the party started, but as my bestie said, ""It's not like anything happens at the beginning of a party! "" 

Oh, how I wish the Fates had given us a sign when he spoke those words! But there was no clap of thunder, no foreboding music, the sky was clear, Hans Zimmer was on vacation, and so I left for Trader Joe's. 

SIL was supposed to be my plus one, but was also sick. Darth Potter and SIL have very similar names. Darth Potter also looks much younger than her acutal age. So when she shows up and says she's my plus one, my friends didn't question it.

And so, when I returned with food, Darth Potter was there, joyfully announcing that her ""daughter"" had finally arrived, while simultaneously apologizing to everyone for how rude I was for being late. Then she dragged me over to meet the surrogate, whom I've known for 4 years now and started yammering on about how wonderful it is to spend time together. 

Now, I could have done the polite thing, and played along so I didn't cause a scene. I also could have caused a scene, could have yelled at her to leave. I was angry enough to do that. Instead, I just turned around and walked away. I went outside, called SFIL, and told him he had 20 minutes to come collect his wife before the NC policy extends to the entire family. He sounded really surprised at where she was, and looked pretty angry when he showed up to get her. Turns out Darth Potter told him that she was covering a shift at work, even left in her uniform to sell the act before making her way over here. 

Darth Potter, being a 55 year old toddler, threw a tantrum because I ""tattled"" and had to literally be carried kicking and screaming out of the house. I ignored her. I ignored her while she was shouting about wanting to stay. I ignored her while she was unceremoniously dumped in the car. I ignored her while she was angrily insulting everyone who looked her way. I ignored her while telling SFIL to drive safe and I ignored her as they drove off. 

I said nothing to her because the moment I saw her standing in my friend's living room, I realized that everything Darth Potter does is for attention. It's what keeps her going, it's the only thing that gives her life meaning. Everything from Christmas dinner to a strangers baby shower has to be about her, because if people are focused on her then they care about her, and if that attention ever stops then she'll be alone. And while some of the stunts she pulled yesterday were beyond the pale, if I acknowledge them by speaking to her, then she wins. But if I don't acknowledge her, she doesn't win, she doesn't lose. She simply cease to exist in my world, and I get to go on living my life.

I'm having a weirdly emotional day, so I guess what I'm trying to say is thank you. Thank you for reading my stories. Thank you for showing me I'm not alone. And thank you for giving me some great advice on how to deal with the JustNo's in my life, both by actually giving advice, and by telling me your stories. I know Darth Potter will be coming back at some point with another grand scheme to reenter our lives, and I know one embarrassing moment isn't enough to make her reconsider her approach. But I also know that if I ever need help, you guys will be here for me.

I'll keep you guys updated, and tomorrow you llamas will get to hear about everything Darth Potter did before I showed up. From what i heard, it was one crazy ride. But I've rambled on long enough for now.

TL;DR: Darth Potter decides to show up to a baby shower she wasn't invited to. I kept my cool and instead of engaging called SFIL to collect her. Also feeling a lot of love for this subreddit."
60,Mostly JYmom has been getting on my nerves lately,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb31cdcf8>,dauntless87,0,7,6,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536083396.0,9cy0j5,"So let me start by saying that my mom is awesome. I'm not sure if her behavior is what you would call BEC or not but here it goes. . . .


When my oldest turned 12 I started letting her wear crop tops. Nothing too short or provocative, but yes, her belly button showed. My mom would make little remarks/jokes about my daughter leaving half of her shirt at home or say she needs a refund because the store didn't give her the whole shirt. Que eye roll. When it really started to bug me was when my mom would ""jokingly"" pull on my daughters shirt to make it longer then complain that the top was now too low cut. . . *Um, duh. you just pulled on it!*
 I personally find nothing wrong with a cute crop top and am of the mindset that if you see something wrong with one on a child then you are the problem, not the child.


Now my daughter is 13 and has taken to big hoop earrings. My mom has a problem with this as well and told me that I need to put a stop to ""All of that"". Um, what the hell does that mean? I feel like she is implying that my child is going to wind up being a slut or something and it will be my fault because I let the girl wear some damn earrings and a short shirt!!! Ugh, maybe I'm wrong. (this may open a whole other can of worms but, while I obviously don't approve of my young daughter being sexually active, we have had age appropriate talks and I am very open with her. I don't believe a female should be shamed if she happens to enjoy sex)


Now to talk about my youngest daughter, she 2 &1/2 and I still breastfeed. My mom will scold her every time she asks to nurse. She tells my daughter that she is too big for that and that she need to eat food like a big girl. My daughter will then start crying and apologize for not being a big girl. WTF? Just leave my baby alone. She will quit when she is ready. And no I will NOT starve her until she is forced to eat ""real food"", why would you even suggest that???


ok rant over. I just had to get some of that out of my head before I explode on my mother"
61,FMIL thinks she is now my actual mother???,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfaceede80>,FluffyOmens,0,230,2217,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1535968482.0,9ck78m,"Hello, hi, hello, I'm going absolutely wild planning my wedding because my FMIL is A LOT. Just... a LOT. I thought I was a lot and used to apologize for it, but this woman is The Most TM, and I don't know where to start.

I am not joking when I say this woman thinks becoming my MIL means she is on the same authority/ emotional/ relationship level as my own mother. Like, she seriously believes I should love her like my own mother immediately and honestly and often INSTEAD of treating my own mom that way.  


This woman literally cried because I didn't give her jobs in the wedding planning that are traditionally given to the Mother of the Bride... because I gave them to my own mother, the MOTHER OF THE BRIDE. She threw an absolute hissy because she felt like she was being excluded from the planning and she had been sooooo involved in her own daughters weddings, so why was she not being incluuuuuded.  We're talking she wants to make my bouquet, sew and fit my veil (which is a family heirloom from... you guessed it, my ACTUAL MOTHERS FAMILY), be in the room when I put on the dress...  I literally have to remind her every time we speak that the things she's mad she wasnt assigned were assigned to MY ACTUAL MOTHER. 

This isnt new, but it's becoming very clear that it's not just jealousy, but actual entitlement to my ""daughter"" behaviors (how do you even DESCRIBE this phenomena). Every holiday, she gets angry that I spend it with my own family. She lives about 1 1/2 hours from my family, so partner and I usually separate and spend our holidays separately, and just visit the other's family around that time but not ON the holiday. This I N F U R I A T E S her. Best example is when I spent MY OWN BIRTHDAY with my !!!TWIN SISTER!!! and she yelled about how selfish for not coming to see her family on my birthday-- all of this in spite of the fact that her family \*does not celebrate birthdays\*.

She also asks me really quite personal questions about things only my mother and partner need to know regarding my PTSD and gets so offended when I refuse to answer her. She whines that she's just trying to support me, but I do not need her to support me in that way? That is actually what my mother and partner are doing, and -they are doing it fine?- She hates that my mother supports me in a way very different from her own (selfish and domineering) style, and tells me that she could help me more than my own mother because she wouldn't ""coddle"" me.

Really, I'm sorry for all the weird emphasis, but I feel like I'm in some alternate universe where the rules are all different. I just don't know what is happening. 

This is the level of this woman. Meanwhile, as she is literally expecting me to respect, obey, and love her like/instead of my own mother, she actually really doesn't like me??? I have PTSD and Bipolar Disorder, and she's literally called me childish for having flashbacks/crying episodes, won't allow me to bring my service animal around her, and constantly tells my partner that they should leave me if I ""become too much"". FMIL doesnt like my job, doesn't like my appearance, hates that I'm not religious, doesn't like my personality, and HATES that I'm pretty forward about what I need from my family/partner regarding my PTSD. AND YET?????  


TLDR; FMIL hates me, bit is also WEIRDLY obsessed with me, and it is MAKING ME BONKERS"
62,In-laws just decided to “pop in”...,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb30fcda0>,Darwinian_10,0,55,558,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1535994852.0,9cn9fc,"So, this is happening as we speak. I’ve been lurking on this sub because I’m not married yet, but my DSO and I are technically common law now. His mother is a narcissist and he is the scapegoat. His brother (BIL) and sister (SIL) are both alternating golden children. (When it suits MIL). SIL basically abandoned her son (4yo), and he has been living with MIL and FIL for about 2 1/2 years, but was there a lot before that too, but that’s another story for another day. BIL (28yo) also moved back in with MIL and FIL last year, and he’s a flying monkey. They live an hour away from us. 

Anyway, on to today...DSO and I had made plans as today is a holiday, and the last long weekend of the summer. We were going to go to the beach, go for a bike ride, etc. That is, until MIL and family decided they were coming in for a visit today. DSO said to me: “you know they won’t stay long, they never do.” But he was WRONG. They showed up a couple of hours ago and brought in an uncooked casserole to put in the oven for dinner, so they’re obviously planning on being here for a few hours longer. Great. I’m already finding it hard to be around them without snapping. They brought the 4 year old with them, as well as BIL, so it’s a full house. 4yo is also a menace. He destroys everything, thinks he’s entitled to storm around our house (we don’t have kids yet, so it’s not kid friendly). MIL and FIL don’t do anything about it. 

As we speak, DSO has taken them out of the house to go play at a playground, because I told him that I couldn’t handle them being in my space and inviting themselves over to spend the whole goddamn day. 

About DSO...he is in the process of growing a spine, and MIL resents me because of that. He still has the scapegoat mentality that if he just pleases her, she’ll love him and give him praise. He says he wants to be LC, but then she pulls shit like this. We’re working on it, but it’s been hard. Every time he visits them, he comes home angry because of how much he doesn’t like being around them. 

Anyway, I just needed a place to vent my frustrations about this, and y’all seem really supportive as a community. Sorry if I got any of the acronyms or terms wrong.  :/

I’m actually thinking of putting the casserole in the oven now so that it’s done quicker and they’re outta here faster...

EDIT: I super love all the devious “BURN THE CASSEROLE” posts from
y’all haha. Amazing. However, I didn’t burn it or drop it. I let it cook. She makes terrible food anyhow. SO calls her meals “congealed slop”, because they’re always greasy and covered in cheese. He’s told her on multiple occasions that I’m a better cook than she is, which pleases me to no end. 

They just left. I hope they felt like I was pushing them out the door, because I practically was. I made it clear to SO that this is to NEVER happen again. I have told him how I feel about it. Next time it happens, I am either locking the door, or I’m leaving for the day. 

I hope they felt like I was being cold to them and ignoring them, because they were not welcome. 

Full disclosure: they technically did tell us they were coming in for the day, but it was an hour before they arrived. My SO said yes without checking in with me first, which I told him wasn’t okay. I felt bad though, because he never gets to see his nephew and wanted to spend time with the kid. I felt bad getting angry with my SO for this, because I get to see my niece a lot more often than he does his nephew. I also feel that MIL guilt trips SO about not seeing the kid though, so it’s a complicated situation. :/ "
63,So I think I found out Bankrupt Psycho’s issue with me,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb30b9f60>,coconuts-commodities,0,6,65,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536034710.0,9csc05,"This whole thing makes me really upset. I’m a very easy going, calm, and also a emotional person, very sensitive to other people. I’ve never had to deal with anyone like her, so she gives me a lot of anxiety. And I generally have a hard time not taking her personally, if anyone can tell so far, 

My bf said he tried to talk to her and asked why she keeps acting like that to me? He said she just repeatedly screamed “no one said I didn’t like her, no one said that” “no one said anyone didn’t like her” when all he said was “mom why do you keep acting that way to (my name)? She never did anything wrong to anyone.”

He said it was a weird interaction. 

And then later she said she doesn’t feel comfortable and is embarrassed by herself when I am there. And feels she can’t talk (about her multitude of bankruptcies, work,  life, etc) issues. (She is constantly just angry, yelling, having a nasty attitude with her mom that lives there about these things, so I know what she’s talking about) 

1. I don’t think this is fair to act insane and nasty to me. But I do understand she is like that with everyone and has something wrong with her 

2. But I do think if you have a mental issue, or some other deeply rooted psych issue, it’s not anyone else’s responsibility except your own as a grown adult. 

3. She’s a grown forty something. Get your life together. 

-So, I wanted to ask if that little except where she said she doesn’t feel comfortable around me makes sense? Do these Narcissistic Personality Disorder MIL’s ever feel guilty or feel bad? 

-Now that she’s comfortable with me, I think she feels she can do that now. I also think she doesn’t like other women in general. She doesn’t really have any girl friends. And she’s always nasty. Which I’ve shared that theory before how she makes comments about money or vacations, etc.

64,"Cake Boss in ""The Social Security Card Debacle""",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb3008f98>,tabletoppineapple,0,43,649,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1535988061.0,9cmawp,"Hi fam. It's been a minute. 

I made a post about CB reusing a gift bag that I gave her by giving it right back to me, learned that I apparently can't take one critical comment over the Internet, and have been silent since then. Well, Cake Boss has been silent too, so I haven't felt the need to share anything lately. 

Here we go. 
FH and I are 26 and 27 years old, but both of our parents still hold on to our important government documents. We are getting married in less than 6 months, and as I've learned from this sub, it is best to get all of our documents in a row early to avoid crazy FMILs from lording over birth certificates and preventing their baby boys from getting a marriage license. 

At the engagement dinner where Cake Boss earned her name I gave a brief overview of plans for wedding weekend, and what Roles and Responsibilities™ the parents and siblings have volunteered to fill. I made the not so big ask of ""we will need these documents in our own possession because we need them, and because we are adults and it's time that we own that responsibility.""

Y'all. I thought it went well. There were no objections, my mother told me exactly where mine were and told me to just call her up and we could go to the bank to get them together. Cake Boss said she knew where FHs were and that she would collect them to hand over. 

There is no way that it could ever have been that easy. 

Nearly one month after that dinner Cake Boss finally decided to do the thing. She looked through the lock box in their home and found his birth certificate but not his SS card. A week prior she had been to the bank to look in the safe deposit box for something else, and it had not immediately presented itself, therefore ""it wasn't there."" 

FH and I are hanging on the couch watching a trash movie and unaware of the tornado coming our way. She sends him a wall of text stating that 1) she didn't have his SS card, 2) that he lost it, 3) this is why she always asks for it back, since he is not responsible enough to not misplace it. 

I'm a problem solver, so I ask FH if he has looked through his locked box in our home or his desk just to be certain that it is not in our possession. Followed up with the classic ""when was the last time you remember using it?"" And uncover that the last time he had needed it was when he was hired five years ago. At that time he was living with Cake Boss and FFIL and fresh from college. If he had followed her ""rules"" he would have brought it right back home and turned it over to her at that time. 

He reaches back out to her to tell her it is not in our place and to ask if she is certain that she doesn't have it. 

Cue the phone call. It's a reiteration of the wall of text exclaiming his irresponsibility, how he can't be trusted, and this is why she still has FSILs docs ( she is 30 years old, you guys.) 

*DRAMATIC REENACTMENT OF CONVERSATION AS DESCRIBED BY FH*

CB ""Well (infantilized nickname) you need your SS card to get a new drivers license. You need to take a week day off and WE will go to the SS office to get a new one. You need to have the new one mailed to MY house, and then you can pick it up.""

FH ""Mom, I'm not going to make these plans until we know it is lost.""

CB ""It is lost. You lost it.""

FH ""I do not need you to go with me to get a new one. And I don't want to have my mail sent to your house.""

CB ""Why not? Why can't your mail be sent here?""

* me in a stage whisper ""because you're a fucking adult and your mail should come you your place of residence""*

FH ""Because I don't want to drive all over town to get my mail."" (Someone teach this boy not to JADE 🙄)


It continues for quite a while until she feels she has come up with a sufficient plan for HER to help FH get a new card. I'm still sitting on the couch convinced that she has it all along, and hasn't truly looked.

THE VERY NEXT DAY

She has gone back to the bank to ""look again"" (or look for the first time in my opinion) and SURPRISE; the card has been found. It was tucked into an envelope with deceased middle sisters SS card all along (remember when I said he was a replacement child in a previous post?)

I asked him if she had apologized about the way that she spoke to him. He said that he doesn't think she realized that she had done it. 😑 I so badly want someone to put this woman into her place, but I so badly do not want to be the person to do it.

65,MIL always has to one-up us,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb31be208>,the_taco_belle,0,44,78,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536028331.0,9crne0,"So my amazing husband and I are pregnant!!! This came as a surprise as I only stopped birth control in June and we really didn’t think it would happen so fast, but we’re over the moon! So far we haven’t told anyone except my parents, my sister, and his mom. My angel parents and wonderful (younger) sister had the best reactions and are equally as excited for us, already plan to buy things and are as supportive as we could’ve ever dreamed. I love them so much. DH was in tears by my parents’ reaction and my dad even pulled him aside to tell him how proud he is of DH (career, being a great husband, just being a stand up guy) and how he knows he will be a great father and he’s there if he has any questions. Once again, my family is just incredible. 

Now DH’s dad is not really in the picture and hasn’t been for 20 years (he and MIL divorced when his alcoholism/pill addiction got out of control and he continues to bounce around rehabs, homeless camps, and random rooming houses while still blowing all his money on drugs and alcohol). DH doesn’t really let it bother him as his mom kicked his dad out when he was a young child and they never really had a relationship anyway. 

I have a lot of respect for MIL for raising my husband to be the wonderful man he is, and even though she easily could, she never speaks badly of DH’s father. She was great at our wedding and was definitely the bigger person, is cordial to his dad, and doesn’t cause issues. However, about two years ago she started dating an older man from their church. They’re from the kind of small town USA church where everyone is born into that church, gets married in that church, raises their family in that church, and dies in that church. That’s great and all, but it also breeds some very closed minded viewpoints and general displeasure at anyone who branches out. I don’t like MILBF much because he’s awkward, never makes an effort to talk to us or have a relationship with us, enables MIL’s incessant negativity, and has made some low key racist/homophobic comments. 

Anyway, we told MIL we’re expecting. We hoped she’d be excited, as DH is her only child and thus the only one who will give her grandchildren. She smiled, said “oh that’s exciting” and proceeded to give us a detailed account of her most recent bowel movements (she had an abdominal surgery a few months ago during which BF tried to guilt us into not keeping a bedside vigil for her despite us both working irregular hours at demanding and inflexible jobs). She then moved on to tell us about going to BF’s family reunion and regale us with stories about people we don’t know or care about,  and closed with telling us she and BF went to look at engagement rings and she thinks he will propose soon. 

Don’t get me wrong, BF has been great in the sense that he took a lot of the responsibility off DH since DH is an only and it was just him and his mom for so long. What gets me is 1) really? We’re PREGNANT and you overlook it for stupid stories about the BF? 2) hope they’re not planning a spring wedding because I’m not dragging my pregnant ass across the state or schlepping a newborn to whatever they’re planning, and 3) why must she always one-up is!? I know this is selfish and probably BEC stuff, but I just want to be excited and happy and when we announce to DH’s extended family (who are all very JustYes with the exception of one AIL/UIL) I want them to share in this with us. I know MIL will be busy interjecting about her stupid plans and trying to get everyone to pay attention to her and it just ... it aggravates me. I could see in DH’s expression how sad he was that her reaction sucked, especially since he’s so excited to be a dad, but he didn’t say anything except “she’s excited for us in her own way.” That killed me. I just wish she could let us have happy and exciting news without having to try to outdo it, and this is a pattern for her. (I might post later about when we announced our engagement, when DH graduated from his job training program, my bridal shower, and when DH recently got honored by his job). Ughhhhh.

66,The Mastermind and My Child Puking,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb3030550>,DollyLlamasHuman,0,32,250,False,JUSTNOMIL,"Easy, breezy, beautiful Llama girl",1536003129.0,9cog7o,"**Background: The Mastermind is my EXMIL with whom I am VVVVVVLC. I haven't had phone contact with her since April 2016 and the only thing I do is write thank-you notes on my DS's behalf because I'm a good Episcopalian.**

​

Last night, my kiddo started puking during his tube feeding. No big deal (even though I uttered a swear word). I turned the feeding pump off, my mom tossed me a towel when she heard me swear (she happened to be walking by my room), I put kidlet in the shower, stripped anything affected off my bed to throw in the washer, and got my kiddo changed into clean jammies. As I was loading the washer, I realized how thankful I am to not be dealing with my ex and The Mastermind.

​

My ex would go full-on Chicken Little. DS puking was totally equivalent to THE SKY IS FALLING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111 When we were married and not in The Mastermind's house, I would roll my eyes and tell him to strip the kid and bathe him while I cleaned up the puked-on things (sheets, rug, pack n' play, etc). Heck, I had to handle my kiddo having a stomach bug  so many times while my ex was conveniently gone that I got used to dealing with it on my own and my ex was part of the problem instead of part of the solution.

​

When we lived with The Mastermind, she'd join my ex in going Chicken-Little-on-Steroids. She made it into a huge fucking deal about OMG THE LAUNDRY (!!!!!) and WE CAN'T WAKE EXFIL FROM HIS NAP (!!!!!!!!) and DLH CAN'T HANDLE THIS (!!!!!!!). Bitch, please. Turn on the shower, let me rinse the kid off, let me put him in clean clothes and (if it was nighttime), throw me the spare sheets so I can remake the bed. I'll put Shout on whatever he puked on (if it was going to stain) and add some OxyClean to the washer so that nothing stains. This is not the end of the fucking world! It stunned me to see two allegedly functional adults without emetephobia going batshit crazy.

​

Then there were the times when my kiddo puked for behavioral reasons... because autism. She would refuse to let me put him in the shower to clean him up, saying that he didn't deserve a shower because he might enjoy the shower. (Granted, my kid loves water like nothing else, but this is a matter of hygiene. Let me give the monster a shower or let me at least hose him off.) I'd have to clean kiddo off with paper towels and baby wipes (when he clearly needed a shower) while she raged about my parenting and how much work I was making for her. Huh. Who's the one ACTUALLY DOING SHIT here?!?!?!? (Of course, this was always when ex and EXFIL would be gone so nobody but me saw any of this and despite the fact that both of them **\*\*KNEW\*\***  she was a compulsive liar, they believed her account of things instead of mine. Woo.) What would have taken maybe 5-10 minutes to clean up (my dad actually clocked this a few months ago) turned into at least an hour because my kid would be melting down about the sensory feelings of not getting rinsed off and smelling like puke and I'd have to deal with that on top of cleaning him up, cleaning up the items that were soiled, and getting laundry going. And she wondered why I did whatever I could to get the fuck out of her house when my kid was awake!

Parenting is SO much easier without the shit fit and micromanaging."
67,I think my MIL just crossed the line between MildlyNO to JustNO...,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfacec5dd8>,anonymity117,0,17,73,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536027922.0,9crlqq,"If this still belongs in r/Mildlynomil please let me know so I can move it there.  This will be long so TL;DR at the bottom.

I've been posting in r/Justnofil about my FIL and r/JUSTNOFAMILY about my SIL.  All throughout I've always maintained that my MIL is a MildlyNo and at worst an enabler of the abuse FIL and SIL have inflicted on my DH, since she doesn't seem as crazy as many of JNMILs I've read here.

Well, an episode last night might have changed all that, but I'm still not 100% certain so I thought I'd ask here.

MIL and FIL married when MIL was 19.  She was in college, pretty, popular with the boys, all that.  But she fell in love with FIL who convinced her to drop out and marry.  She had SIL when she was 20, then DH 4 years later.

The marriage was intensely volatile.  FIL and MIL argued often, and MIL caught FIL cheating on her with different women over the years.  The final straw was when he defrauded MIL, her sister, and SIL of their inheritance/savings, that he is still paying back to his day, almost 25 years later.  She packed her bags, said not a word of goodbye to her kids, and just went back to her dad's house.

DH was 11.

To say it devastated him is an understatement.  His grades plummeted.  MIL took to drinking until she passes out.  She even resorted to violently beating DH's back with a flip flop when he refused to do his homework, all while intoxicated.  SIL had to pull her off DH to get her to stop.

DH was left under the care of FIL until the day we married, so FIL controlled every aspect of his life by that point.  His education, his college course, his friendships, everything.  DH was called stupid, slow, usesless.  When he complained to MIL, she shrugged it off and told him to just grin and bear it, and to respect his dad nonetheless.

That was his norm.

Last night, it all came to a head.  FIL had fallen and sprained his knee, plus a water incident at his house made FIL call DH early morning screaming.  DH was obviously drained from all this, and asked MIL to help him care for FIL.  By the way, we live in Southeast Asia so not much of elderly care is done by the government.

She explodes and points the finger at me and my parents, saying we put him up to this, insisting that it's unreasonable to ask her and SIL to contribute in any way.  Partly true, since we did tell DH that he can't be expected to shoulder all of their care simply because he's human.  She then goes into a tirade on how DH should be defending her, and is blaming me and my folks for turning her son against her.

DH was reduced to tears after that conversation.

**TL;DR: DH asks MIL for help in caring for his injured but abusive dad.  She explodes and blames my parents and me for turning her son against her.  Has she crossed the line from MildlyNO to JustNO?**"
68,MIL has baby rabies update: it's all my fault,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb301d358>,blanketburritos,0,54,717,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1535980955.0,9clfk0,"After my last post, my MIL had more things to say re: grandbaaaabies.

DH said something about the way she punished him when he was a teenager, mentioning a time he got grounded for a long time. She denied it, then said he made it up, then said if it did happen he deserved it, then said:

MIL: Well, I insist you have three or four kids! Then we'll see how the stories change!
Me: ...I don't think you can insist that.
MIL: I can say it!
Me: Yeah, rudely!

There was also a conversation about how she and FIL don't have to put the grandkids to bed on time, and SIL was saying that if MIL & FIL don't follow the rules, SIL will find a new person to babysit. FIL (since MIL was away) kept insisting she wasn't being serious. I guess he was kidding? But I said: ""Grandparents who don't follow the rules have to go into grandparent time out.""

At dinner, just me, DH, SIL, and BIL (DH's brother & SIL's husband), I expressed my frustrations with how MIL acts and the things she says. I brought up the thing I posted about on Saturday, how she wants SIL to go into early labor so MIL will have time to bond with ""her baby.""

They all defended her. SIL said that's just how she is (hah) and it isn't how she meant it. BIL says I'm making an assumption about her intentions and I'm assuming the worst. DH stayed silent but kind of nodded along with them.

I tried to defend myself, but they just kept saying MIL doesn't mean it the way I'm taking it, so I should just.... not take it that way? Like it suddenly becomes not rude if I'm not paying attention?

It made me feel crazy. If it doesn't bother anyone else, should it bother me? I don't have kids so I'm (generally) not subjected to the brunt of MIL's craziness, and I'm fully ready to say they can't babysit whenever the time comes. 

I'm here for like thirty more hours so I may have more to say tomorrow. Send help.

PS - MIL and FIL are on the phone with FIL's mom right now to wish her happy birthday, and she's guilting them about not calling earlier. It's 9:20am. Crazy MIL runs in the family."
69,"Christmas, the gift that keeps on giving.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb2ff1cf8>,Stefaki,0,16,33,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536043105.0,9ct516,"Hey llamas! I am back for some advice. B.B. can fill you in, but my JN is my mom. I moved far away and she visits (but doesn’t stay with us) for usually 5-9 weeks at a time.

Last year she visited at Christmas-B.B. can fill you in on that ridiculousness. She came for 9 weeks and while she was here me hubs and DD went away for 4 days, between Christmas and New Years. She was told well in advance, and while she was not happy and tried multiple times to change our plans, she dealt with it.

This year the plot thickens...first she asks if we are planning on going away again like last year. I tell her yes, probably for longer than last year. So she started by saying that she is coming sometime around Nov 20 and leaving by Jan 20. Fuck, it’s a long time but what can you do. Then it changed to “ a month, month and a half”. Then it was a month. Then she says that she can only come for 3 weeks from the 15th of Dec. And if we are going away for a week what’s the point? So “think about what you want to do and let me know what I am doing. And then if that’s the case YOU can tel DD that I am not coming for Christmas”

So I feel like this is really manipulative of her. She knows that this is our only time to go away as a family ALL year and she is basically saying don’t go? For her? But I feel like if her circumstances have changed then that’s on her to change her plans? Also cause she’s sneaky this may just be her seeing what we will do (she likes to test people) and then coming for 6 weeks anyways. 

I feel confused and I don’t know what to do. On one hand I definitely do not want to miss out on our family time and our one chance to travel during the year. On the other hand I feel like a horrible person to tell her no, not changing our plans come another time. But that’s what she wants right? Either for me to feel like an asshole or to bow down. Ugghh.

Also pertinent, I believe, is the convo we had yesterday. She was telling me about some family drama and then:

Me: so basically [cousin] set a boundary and [aunt] is not talking to them?! That’s mature!!

 Mom: but I agree with her, your generation has no respect.  No respect for family members for their age, and their station in life and the family. No respect just for our age at least!

Me: well I think every generation feels that to some extent with the younger generation

Mom: no! It wasn’t like that with my parents generation or with mine. Your generation has no respect!

Me: (not in the mood for an argument) nope, I guess not.

Upon discussing this with hubs, my biggest question is how?? How are we so disrespectful?? What does showing respect look like to her? Also this catering to old people in our family is something she complained about my whole life. It’s like I saw you do shit cause you “had” to and it made us all miserable....why would I want to perpetuate that?? Also is she just pissed cause she kissed ass her whole life expecting the same and now the ass kissing is coming to an end??

Sorry if this is rambly, but I feel like this is the undercurrent of most of our arguments. I am a disrespectful, inconsiderate little shit (as has been told to me by her many times and in front of others) cause I don’t do what she wants, when she wants. She has always hated her parents and done bare minimum to please them, usually not pleasing them at all, she is hardly one to talk about respecting people! 

I guess I am angry cause I have to tell her that we won’t change our plans  at Christmas and I know it’s going to be a shit show. I am so over all this drama. I am tired of being an asshole cause I put MY FAMILY first. She once said to me while we were arguing “You have your husband, your daughter, your business, and me? I am a distant FOURTH!!!” Um, yes? That’s how it’s supposed to be??? Which one of those things should you be ahead of????

Am I wrong? I don’t feel like I am wrong. My husband is pissed and says there is no way we are not going away like we planned.

Edit: I just want to be clear that when she visits (from another country, an ocean away) she does not stay with me. Her parents have a family home here (5 minutes away) and she stays there."
70,Gollum has a foot in mouth moment. Acts like it wasn’t horrific.,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfaced4da0>,Goodlittlewitch,0,6,158,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536010064.0,9cpel0,"This isn’t actually about me, but my family friend thinks these are hilarious (and sadly, accurate) and has allowed me to post it. 

And so hobbitses, here is the tale of Granny Gollum and the major, ridiculously hard to watch, kind of painful to hear about foot in mouth blunder in which Granny pretended after was a non-issue. 

“Granny Gollum has no issues being friendly” says GG, basically. Outwardly, she’s the friendliest person you’ll ever meet. When you first meet her, she comes off as this insanely generous, kind, thoughtful person and not at all the kind of person who will smile as she’s slamming your fingers in the door, but you’re all here so obviously you know better. 

Weddings... weddings make GG nuts. She prides herself on having had 4 bachelorette parties (work, friends, family, friends from other city) and having had her entire town chip in for her ridiculously lavish, 750 person wedding. She wants us all to have this luxury and the non stop attention and all the dramatic bullshit that never seems to end with large weddings and older ladies.  She tried multiple times to undermine my wedding and the only reason she backed off was because DH told her where to put her opinions. 

Anyhow, a little backstory here without rambling much more. My friend was raised by both of her parents in a wonderful loving family next door (relatively because mcmansion acreage thing) to GG& co. Growing up, the families were very good “don’t even knock just come in with a beer” type families, and the parents are still very close (and we all ended up very good friends obviously) 

The couple had decided to go mostly
DIY, have a 100 person wedding (kids included so really probably 75-80 people). They have very low key invitations, very understated  plans for decor, very beautiful but not in an obvious way kind of setup. Obviously GG has poo poo’d all of this because it’s small and the bride doesn’t like attention, which honestly baffles GG in general. 

So the other day, the bride came over to GG’s to show us the wonderful gift her mother had given her. In knowing that they wanted frugality and understated beauty, her mother had hand crafted the most beautiful bouquet you’ve ever seen- and promised to do more come next year closer to the date. 

We all gasped and were amazed by her mom’s clear eye for colour and style. It was gorgeous, feminine, and fit her thing perfectly. Gg? Said nothing. Then, when we thought we might be spared... 

“Well, that is NOT acceptable” 

... no one said a word. Thankfully DH took that moment to remind his mother that she is not involved, has no say, and is being a total ass for no reason. She excused herself for 10 and came back as we were all chatting over coffee. Bride had the sense to ask GG to lie to her mother about how she truly felt about the bouquet. 

GG replied “oh my gosh that is so beautiful I can’t wait to talk to your mother about that! She is just so creative you guys are going to have such a beautiful wedding!!! It reminds me of my wedding...(cue long, unrelated story that gives her the main stage and probably didn’t happen) 

We all excused ourselves after that one. Time to go home, circus is ramping up, long drive ahead of us. Bride has now told her family that GG gets no more info about pending nuptials haha

Sorry hobbitses, that was longer than I meant it to be. 

Tl;Dr Granny is a jerk who loves to rewrite history and when this story comes up later she’ll act like only the second part happened. "
71,JNMom or was I in the wrong?,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb2fd8f28>,ColdburnEntity,0,8,10,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536058001.0,9cuhvp,"Hello everyone. I'll fully admit that I'm very much a lurker, but I adore this sub and its community. I found it about a month ago and been binging between classes and occasional slow moments ever since. I will warn that I tend to have a sailor's vocabulary, but it shouldn't be too bad. This will also be a bit long.

I may have a JNMom on my hands, but I'm not sure. It's hard to figure out if the awfulness is because of you or because you can't recognize you're in the FOG. I've watched you guys talk down people who were making mountains out of anthills and convince people on the fence about their MIL/Mom that things are, indeed, fucked up. I won't lie, I'm nervous as shit about this, because only my closest friends and immediate family plus an aunt know it, but I think I need some unbiased perspectives to get some closure. So, today, I'm going to talk about the most fucked up thing my mother has done to me: kicking me out during Easter weekend. 

For context, I'm in my early 20's and going through college while living at home. Dad's not in the picture and I live with (jn?)Mom, OB1, and OB2. JNMom is the breadwinner of the household. OB1 was also working, but at a shitty factory job and OB2 was also going through the academic wringer with me. JNMom works for most of the day at a city that's 1-2 hrs drive away from home. 

This was happened last year, and we were in a really bad spot. Bills weren't being paid, we were occasionally going hungry, and shit was just really bad. It got to the point where my JYBF sent me money so I could buy myself food at a local fast food joint and a bit extra for some basic groceries. 

Roughly a week before Easter, the power went out. My brothers and I initially thought it was only going to be for a few days, so we resolved to suck it up and deal with it. This went on for a few days, but after a while, JNMom clued us in: no, it wasn't going to be a few days. It was going to be out for two weeks - until my mother could be paid. 

I won't lie, I didn't handle that very well. There's a myriad of reasons I hide behind when justifying what happened, but really, it boils down to two points: me and my cat. We don't live in a particularly cold state, but I straight up just don't handle the cold well. Even in the middle of summer, I'm usually still wearing jeans and a hoodie (or at least carrying it around), even when it's 80-90F. There was also my coursework, as some of it relied on online or technology-dependent components. But to be honest, I could (and did) go to a Starbucks, buy something cheap off of the menu, and work on it on the laptop. 

Really, if I'm being honest, it was mostly because of my cat. I had adopted her (read: picked up a half-dead cat off the sidewalk and nursed back to health) about a year ago from the time of this, and I loved that little grouchy thing to the bottom of my heart. She was old, fragile, had a myriad of health issues, and was as close to medically retarded as a cat could be, but she was my baby. Seriously, if animals could be on the spectrum, she would have been in the deep end, but that just made her all the more loving and charming to me (and my JYBF for that matter). That said, she dealt with the cold worse than me, which pushed me towards action more than anything else, tbh.

So... I called my (mostly) JY aunt. This was the second time I had called her about help with the power being cut off. The first time was several months prior. Originally, I had called her to ask if she wanted any of our refrigerated/frozen foods, but it devolved into me sobbing my eyes out and asking for help very, very quickly. This is a small thing that I had forgotten up until now, but I was fucking terrified of my mother finding out about me calling her and begged her not to say anything. Not that mattered much, really, it was a no-brainer on who would have the gall of asking JYA for help.

To be completely honest, the next part is something of a blur. I don't remember much about it, but it still hurts like fucking hell. The brothers and I went to Starbucks to work on stuff until it closed. While we were there, the brothers were texted by JNMom and OB1 told me we were going home. Okay, it's a bit early, but fine. I was too anxious to care about the 'why,' or why I hadn't been texted, either. I remember being confused when we got home on why they were giving me weird looks and asking if I needed help. It took about thirty minutes for OB1 to get more than a little agitated and me finally getting enough context clues to realize that she had texted OB1 and OB2, but not *ME*, that me and spectrum kitty were no longer welcome in her home and that I should go over to JYA's. I remember screaming at OB1 to fuck off and that I'd take care of my shit, so he did, indeed, fuck off while I freaked out. 

I called JYA and asked her to come grab me and texted JYBF what happened. For context, JYBF a continent and an ocean away from me, so I couldn't exactly go over to his place. I regret going over to JYA's place now, but honestly? I had nowhere else to go. So I stuffed spectrum kitty into a cat carrier, shoved some clothes and random personal effects into my schoolbag, and left with JYA. Apparently, JNMom had come home while I was packing and left with the brothers, so the house was empty when JYA and I left.

That weekend was... not good. My JYA takes care of my justno grandfather, who was kept in the dark about everything due to my JYA's insistence. He was *not* happy I was there and made it clear he wanted me gone ASAP. Even a year later, I still haven't forgotten it and we have a very superficial relationship. My cat could be let out in my JYA's bedroom during the day, but she had to go back into the cat carrier at night due to the fact that there were cats already living there. 

I legitimately don't know what I would have done without my boyfriend. He was fucking amazing and totally on point while I was falling apart. He researched cheap vehicles that I could live in, grants/scholarships so I could continue schooling, what options I had in welfare, low income options for veterinary care for spectrum kitty, and likely more that I've forgotten. I don't know what I would have done without it, and this is far from the only thing he's done to help me with absolute bullshit. 

I was kicked out on Good Friday, so I ended up spending the entire long weekend there. JYA convinced JNGF to let me stay there for a while, but practically it was only really going to last for a month or two. But I remember dreading that Sunday, because then OB1, OB2, and JNMom would be there for dinner and I couldn't... face them. Face her, really, if I'm being honest. 

Luckily, that ended up being a problem. JNMom texted everyone (I honestly don't remember at that point if that included me, but I don't *think* so) saying she was not attending Sunday dinner to give me some space, but OB1 and OB2 would bring me home with them afterwards. I did end up going back with them, as it was the easiest option for everyone involved (including JYBF, as helping me get into a semi-stable situation was going to not be cheap on him as I had *no* savings). 

She wasn't at the home when I arrived back. Instead, she appeared the next day, and... neither of us have ever spoken or even acknowledged it. I avoided her for roughly a month afterwards, but she acted like everything was fine and ignored it. 

A year later, the same holds true, but I'm not fine. Our financial situation has improved significantly (or she's hiding it better now), but I'm constantly wondering if I'll still have a home this time next week, and it fucks with me a *LOT*. I suspect that my depression is likely caused or heavily influenced by this event, as it's worsened by no small degree in the last year. I've built up a substantial amount of savings since then, but it wouldn't be enough to pay for a motel for more than a month and certainly not enough to purchase even a cheapo car. JYBF also helped me purchase a big ass MOLLE backpack and helped me fill it up to use as a bug-out bag. Sadly, spectrum kitty has passed away since then, but I take solace in the fact that I wouldn't have to worry about taking care of her if/when I become homeless (and it would be homeless - I *refuse* to go back to my JYA, as much as I know she would want to help. I will not be made to feel like utter crap by JNGF and I would still be in JNMom's reach of control. I almost regret letting myself be kept under her control when I went to JYA, but I had spectrum kitty. I didn't have any other option that wouldn't ultimately hurt her more). 

At this point, I'm sorta in limbo. I'm still living with her as I don't have too many options, but I've made some vague plans to make my escape, as it were. But she's also paying for my education and if I fucked off, it would take me years to get to a point where I could reasonably continue it again. Right now, I think it'll be another year or so until I can move into a university dorm. Honestly, I just want to leave. I want to hitchhike a thousand miles away and deal with being homeless and start again, without her or my asshole OB1 or any of the rest. The rest of my family are, for the most part, just yes and have *no* idea about any of this and while I think they would be horrified to learn about last year, I'm also scared of them all turning into FMs so I'd rather disappear and not have to deal with it. 

Thing is, though, that for the most part? I've had a good relationship with my mother. She's supporting me through school and letting me live in her home for free. I don't have a job because I don't think I'd be able to handle both working and going to school full time. She's generally been very supportive and loving, barring some other isolated incidents and utter insanity regarding her pet dog. It makes me wonder if I deserved what happened.

72,Thought Dicksmack Paddywhack might be coming around. We thought wrong. Advice on when to finally confront?,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb2f90278>,uh_lee_sha,0,9,81,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536018519.0,9cqgk8,"So since my last post a month or so ago, Dicksmack Paddywhack started contacting us more. We had never officially gone no contact and always hoped that with enough boundary setting and reality checking, eventually she would come around. Her attempts to talk to us actually seemed sincere and she was showing more awareness for others than either of us had ever known she was capable of. SIL has been (in mine and DH's opinion) overly cruel to DP and we actually started feeling kind of bad for her. We agreed that she was putting forth effort to make amends, but probably wasn't sure how to.

Out of the blue about two weeks ago, she texted DH that she was thinking of taking time off to come visit us before DH deploys again (she's never done this before. Usually she guilt trips us into visiting her, but has never offered to travel to see us). DH wasn't thrilled with the idea of her visiting and told her he was trying to go back to our home state before he left so he could see everyone.

DH and I chatted about the possibility and agreed that it would probably be a good idea for him to see his mom before leaving the country. We agreed that if she apologized for her behavior at our wedding that we would help her find a hotel near our home, let her visit the house with supervision and do some touristy things together for a weekend. 

To test the waters of her newfound interest in our lives and attempts to repair things, I sent her a text saying, ""Would love to chat and put together a system for when DH is deployed so that you're more in the loop. I get the vibe that you'd like to be more involved.""

AND THE BITCH GHOSTED ME. I sent that message over two weeks ago and no response. But she's posted on social media a dozen times since then and posted twice the same day I sent the message, so there's no reason she hasn't seen it or been able to respond. She hasn't said a peep to DH since either. Not even about visiting. So apparently that was all for show.

I so badly want to text her again and say, ""guess I was wrong. Good luck getting in touch with him while he's overseas"" or something equally snarky but DH has convinced me that saying anything else at this point would only make matters worse and let her ""win."" But I am SO pissed. Anytime I think about it, I get so angry. 

We have agreed a visit with her at this point is out of the question and I will absolutely not allow someone who ghosts me into my home. We move back to their state next summer. When do we have the come-to-Jesus no contact conversation with her? DH desperately wants to keep a relationship with his father, but it's impossible to do so and cut his mother out. If nothing else, a very straightforward, hurt feelings conversation of boundaries needs to happen. I imagine this works better in person. And that can't happen until after he's back from his deployment. His parents also have no idea we are planning to move back yet, because they're on a very strict information diet and are blocked on social media.

Any advice on when, where, how to proceed from here? When is too soon? When is too late? What boundaries should we absolutely express and how? I would love a fresh start, moving forward when we move and we genuinely hoped she would move forward with us, but apparently not. I'm usually a very kind, forgiving person, but this is just childish and I'm tired of being stressed out and angry because of her. "
73,No contact to be broken in 6 days,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb301d0b8>,shewantstheJD,0,40,174,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536003623.0,9coios,"DF and I have been no contact with the future in laws for one month and a week now. My stress levels have been down and I’ve actually been able to enjoy our engagement finally. We are so much happier just not dealing with them. 

It seems they’ve noticed and the constant calls, voicemails and messages have begun. We’ve ignored them all. I let DF handle his family and make it a point not to interact. FMIL like to perpetuate the stigma that I’m the “angry black woman” so I tend to hold my tongue. I know I shouldn’t. 

Now my issue is I am heading to in-laws state for FJYSIL bridal shower in 6 days. FMIL and FJNSIL will be there. She’s practically FMIL clone. I’m not sure what to expect at the bridal shower. I plan on just having fun and ignoring them, but I’m worried they’re going to try to corner me and say something. 

A little bit of background: 
FMIL insisted on throwing FJYSIL a bridal shower with her friends and family who weren’t invited to the wedding in Oct. I was invited initially by FMIL, but then uninvited. 

Unbeknownst to her at the time I’m a bridesmaid so I was fucking going anyway. Then FJYSIL told me it wasn’t her real bridal shower. She didn’t even want to go. Plus dealing with FMIL and the faaaamily sounded awful. So we decided that I wouldn’t go and would come to the real bridal shower in September.

FMIL of course lost her mind about how it looks and how dare I not go to “her” bridal shower. I didn’t care. 

If anyone has been in this situation before let me know what to expect. My anxiety is through the roof. I’ll be surrounded by FJYSIL’s family and they know of the crazy so I should be ok, but any guidance is appreciated. Thanks for reading. "
74,T-Rex and the discovery of the engagement ring,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb2fadfd0>,commentspanda,0,13,481,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1535981762.0,9cliqg,"Just after the Christmas from hell (previous post), Future DF became official DearFiance. I initially offered to keep it a secret (although I was dying to tell people) as all his family were on my social media aside from T-Rex and he had made it clear he wouldn’t be contacting her. He was adamant he didn’t care if someone told her, it wasn’t a secret. It just wouldn’t be him. So yaaaaay I got to share photos of my pretty ring. We reassured his family it wasn’t a secret and he would tell her when he spoke to her again at some point. He was also clear  that it was no biggie if someone else told her. After about 3 months of no contact from her as she was “very very angry at his poor behaviour”, she sent her faux-pology text about it being the brain injurys fault she had no filter and couldn’t control what she said about me.  Rah. 

He deliberated for days and finally decided he would accept it at face value as an apology attempt. While it was manipulative and totally in denial that she was the problem, it was always hard to tell what her cognitive function was at any given time because of her brain injury...and it did seem she meant to apologise and mend some fences. I was clear I wasn’t ready for contact again but supported his choice. They had a few fortnightly phone calls (awkward as hell to listen to, but apparently she was telling everyone they were back on good terms) and then one weekend she texted him “can’t talk this weekend, will let you know when I’m up to it again”. Uh-oh. Nanna had let the engagement out of the bag. 

We had three more glorious months of silence after that and then a bunch of messages about how she felt bad he hadn’t told her, she was happy that he was happy and had a new life with dog and OP (yes - the dog was listed first)  and that she just wanted things to go back to normal. DF was very shiny spined and with my help on wording, he let her know things would never go back to the way they were before because her actions had forever changed things. However, he was open to moving forward from this point. 

Cue another 2 months of glorious silence. 

Eventually the texts started again and she just pretended nothing had happened and that she was starting fresh. DF is now much more reserved in his contacts with her and rarely shares personal info, he’s also elected to not allow the phone calls to start again. If she calls he just doesn’t answer. Apparently she tells the family everything is a-okay though and they are back on the best of terms. 

Bonus: the Christmas after the Christmas from hell we went overseas to avoid all family contact. A few weeks after that we found out beautiful Nanna was very sick so we went back to hometown to visit with family from all over the world. We understood T-Rex would be there - we hadn’t seen her in 14 months at this point and the last time I had seen her she’d been screaming in my face at the Christmas from hell. I promised to be on my absolute best behaviour for Nanna, although I did have some clear boundaries in place and DF knew I would clearly articulate when I was uncomfortable and move away. His extended family were on board with supporting this. My boundaries went out the window the night before though as we met up with his half brothers and the youngest (17yo now) has just been diagnosed with bi polar and was really nervous about the family thing the next day. I made the decision that no matter how much of a dick she was, I wouldn’t leave until he did. I didn’t feel the need to share that with her though. 

As we arrived to the very public space with all his family around, I gave beautiful Nanna a present of some photos of us. She (and back in the before-the-crazy-kicked-in-time, T-Rex) were the only people DF allowed to have printed photos of him. T-Rex immediately saw the photos and grabbed them off Nanna then turned to me and said “I want a copy of these, I have no photos of you both that are recent”.

My inner demon really wanted to say PLAY BITCH GAMES, WIN BITCH PRIZES!!!

Instead, i smiled serenely and said “I’m sure DF would be more than happy to arrange some reprints for you” and sailed off knowing full well that wasn’t ever happening as the ONLY reason they ever got any photos was because I printed them out. "
75,Dubiously Delusional and the Autism Diagnosis,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb2f90160>,TheIdealisticCynic,0,12,37,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536031694.0,9cs0ri,"DS has received his diagnosis, Autism, level 3 (which was surprising to me). It’s a lot of emotions I won’t get into here. 

We chickened out of sending Dubious our rules. When DH and I discussed it, we realized that most of them were just our regular rules (when we thought DS was neurotypical) and that we just needed to enforce them better. We also chickened out of telling Dubious in person. The only rule we added was that she was not to post about it on facebook, for DS’s future privacy. We also didn’t want her to use our child for likes and sympathy points, because fuck that. 

She took it well, and my annoyance with her reaction was mostly BEC. 

“I’m sorry. I know this must be hard on you and OP. At least now you can get services to help.”

I’m sorry??? We have been fighting for this a long time. This is not sad news. This is a sigh of fucking relief. Like, yeah, we get access to more services, but we have had SLPs for a year and a half. DH pointed it out and said it was upsetting for her to ignore that. 

She then went apology love-bombing and over the top. “Oh, we are just so proud of you!! You’ve done so much!!!!” Whatever, you have literally 0 clue. 

Yesterday, she apologized again for the comment about the services. It sounded sincere. 

Then she texted again, “I just never know what to say! It’s so hard to talk to you boys!”

Oh, right, I forgot it was about you. So close to being human. So. Fucking. Close. "
76,Overly gift-giving MIL being obsessive about us using her gifts??,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb2f3d3c8>,shartweekondvd,0,48,51,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536022814.0,9cqzpj,"Hey, LTL;FTP; acronym acronym

So my boyfriend and I just moved in together at the beginning of July. His mom (BMIL) has always been *relatively* nice and friendly to me and almost ALWAYS gives me small gifts that she ""just had laying around"" or ""saw and she thought of me/us"" whenever she/we visits (which is only a few times a year because she use to live a ways away). I say relatively because she still makes snide comments about our apartment choice (""dangerous, shabby, we can afford better""--despite us wanting to aggressively pay off our debts so we're okay with living cheaply), the fact that we're moving in/sleeping in the same bed before marriage, what I'm wearing if we go out to eat on Sundays (she thinks one should always dress up on Sundays regardless? Idk), etc. I mean she can be like, middle aged southern lady style too much, but that's how some of my family is so I can deal. I just change the subject or make a joke to definitely shut down the conversation but also without being too rude.

Anyway whenever she gave me stuff, which was jewelry like 75% of the time, I would always try to wear it next time I see her because I know how nice of a feeling that is (seeing someone use/like your gift). It's rarely 'my style' but again, I'm trying to be nice and I could tell she appreciated it.

So now we live much closer to her and boyfriend's dad since moving in July. Not like next door, but close enough for her to visit a bit too often for my taste TBH. 

But now it's an issue because she A) rarely sees me wearing her jewelry because she comes by unexpectedly really often and B) she complained that we didn't have any of the trinkets (the other 25% of gifts) out in the open in our new apartment. (And slightly irrelevant C) I have to hear her small comments more frequently than before).

At first she just made side comments about it when we were moving in, but now she is asking straight up where ""that cute so-and-such thing is"".

Now, keep in mind none of this is my/our style. I'm talking like, a little cutesy plaque with a freakish looking  cat on it with cat pawprints throughout, with an engraving that says ""pray for me, my girlfriend is Irish"" (my ancestry is Irish, but I'm only 1/4 and don't identify as Irish, she just heard once that my family is and bought this I guess). It's all like... Stuff you would find either in the clearance at a Hallmark store 15 years ago (which I think is likely the case knowing her) or in those mail order magazines my grandmom used to get.

She's also a quilter and made us a quilt. Now, I totally respect the amount of time, money, and energy that goes into quilting. But they're just rarely if ever aesthetically appealing to me. Plus the one she made is not only particularly ugly but also isn't particularly warm, it's just... fabric? Idk. She also tried to give us the most hideous curtains ever made by man but I flat out rejected those and lied saying we had already ordered some. I took a picture of them before I'll try and find it because I just got a new phone. They had sequins on them y'all. Sequins. On curtains. For adults. What. 

As it turns out, evidently the last time she visited was the last straw because we didn't have the quilt on our bed. The next time boyfriend was at BMIL's house, she said that it really hurt her feelings that it wasn't on the bed (but it was folded nicely and slung on the back of our armchair in the living room!!) and that we didn't have any of her ""decorations"" out (again, these aren't decorations, they are knick knacks at best). She also told him that it hurt her feelings that I wasn't wearing any of the jewelry anymore but was instead opting for ""crap from Target"". Now, admittedly I do get a fair amount of my jewelry from Target. But firstly, my style is really simple, petite gold jewelry... and that exclusively. And secondly, all of the stuff she gets me is from her sister's jewelry MLM thing (which she gets for free!!!) and it is shitty quality... Target jewelry is still leagues better than what she gives me. Anyway, she just went on a mini tirade about everything and my boyfriend was just a bit too diplomatic about it ""oh we haven't finished unpacking"", ""shartweek is still trying to figure out where she wants everything to go"", etc. 

So anyway sorry this got long, but my question is what to do about this. I almost wish that she was screaming/crying/a complete wacko about all this like we see a lot of the time on here, but instead is just saying ""how much it hurts her feelings"" and is a relatively otherwise tolerable woman... Or at least was, because I'm starting to get worried about a ""death by a thousand cuts"" with all her comments I'm getting more and more frequently now. And this is all even harder since my boyfriend and I have every intention of marrying, so I don't want this bridge to burn before it's even built. Any suggestions y'all?"
77,"Falsetto Fiona ""told me so"".",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb2f5e3c8>,justhereforjustno,0,56,157,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1535997907.0,9cnpek,"I posted yesterday about the mostly BEC bullshit with Falsetto Fiona at my parents' house Saturday. As promised, here's the story of how DD choked and Fiona managed to be even more annoying about it.



So, 9 month old DD was in her [bumbo seat](https://www.amazon.com/Bumbo-B10056-Floor-Seat-Blue/dp/B0092NNQ98) eating mandarin oranges and playing with an ice cube my sister gave her. She's had ice before and never really had a problem with it, plus the piece wasn't that big. 



Falsetto Fiona makes a comment about it being too big and I reply, ""She's fine, she's had them plenty of times before,"" and of course, within *literally 2 seconds* DD is making that horrible gagging face with her eyes bugging out. 



*Important information: I am first aid/CPR/AED certified for infants, children, and adults. My dad used to be a paramedic, still works in a related field, and teaches first aid/CPR/AED classes regularly. Some of you remember that Falsetto Fiona used to be a nurse once upon a time. According to the American Heart Association, the procedure for a choking infant is to first sweep your finger to try to dislodge the object. If that doesn't work, you hold the infant facing down, about a 45 degree angle to the floor, and perform hard back blows between the shoulder blades until the item is dislodged (or professional help arrives, if needed). This information is relevant, I promise.*




I sweep DD's throat with my finger, no dice. I whip her out of the bumbo and try to turn her upside down. She keeps trying to lift her head, she's heavy, I'm also trying to beat her back, so it's difficult. Fiona gets in my face and screams, ""You have to put her head down!""  So I yell back, ""That's what I'm trying to do!"" I'm trying hard not to panic at this point. 
 


DD's making this awful sharp, wheezy, inhale every 5ish seconds, which is terrifying but at least I know she's getting some air.



I'm making zero progress so I say, ""Dad-"" and try to pass her, very clearly to my dad and around Fiona, who is standing between me and my dad. Fiona practically rips DD from my arms and holds her facing down but parallel to the floor and just hits her really hard on her lower back like 3 times. It looked like she was just spanking her.



DD is now obviously panicking more, time is passing, so I yell, ""Just give her to dad!!"" Fiona hesitated for a split second but complied. My dad grabs DD and starts following the actual first aid procedure for a choking infant. It's not working, so I get down in front of DD's face while Dad was still following first aid, and I shove my finger as far back as I can into DD's throat to try to see if I can feel anything. She swallowed hard, inhaled with a sharp cry, and started gasping. 



Dad handed her to me and she reeled for a bit trying to recover. She was breathing and just needed to calm down at this point and was trying to pull my shirt off to get at my boobs. 


Then Fiona starts panicking  and yelling that she's not okay yet, she's still choking because, ""her mouth is blue!! She's blue around her mouth!"" DD was pale around her mouth, *because she was just fucking choking*, but she wasn't blue. Her breathing had calmed and she had calmed down, so I just ignored Fiona, snuggled DD close and then nursed her a few minutes after. We ended up discovering she choked on a combo of ice cube and mandarin orange.



It was absolutely terrifying. Everyone was really quiet after and seemed to think it was my fault. My mom called it ""a learning experience"" in a very condescending tone.  My brother ended up joining us later, my mom recounted the tale, and my brother came to me and said ""I heard we almost lost my niece tonight."" Totally blaming me. Wonderful. 


But Fiona, the rest of the night, kept looking at me and shaking her head saying, ""I just *knew* that ice cube was too big...""  I get it, she fucking told me so. By the end of the night, I'm surprised my optical nerves were still attached from all of the eye rolling I was doing. 


As if she and creepy FIL weren't enough to deal with, I left that night feeling like the world's worst mother. And she only made it worse. I nearly had a break down in the car on the ride home. I feel  better now, but I'm still fucking annoyed."
78,Update: The Nose holds me underwater and it is somehow my fault,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb2f11908>,DryDesertBastard,0,35,285,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1535984463.0,9cluac,"In my last post, I mentioned how my mother, The Nose, held me underwater as a child. I posted a vague bit about it on social media without naming names or making reference to who it was and believed it was Not the Worst Idea and that victims shouldn't have to be silent. Apparently since I've been relocating my stuff and working remotely, The Nose felt it was necessary to stalk my social media because I am a child and need big brother keeping an eye on me.

I got a sobbing call about how:

1. She didn't do it 
2. It happened to her as a kid, why would she do it? 
3. She didn't mean it 

I have been in the process of relocating myself and all my belongings and had many things still over my their house. I did a recon of whatever I could fit in two tiny sedans in the dead of night. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to grab everything (a lot of my things are very fragile because... idiot) and had to return the other day because my very finicky plants I've been growing (these are the same plants I've posted about which the Nose hates) were going to die if I didn't take care of them.

SO convinces me to tell them I'm on my way over to get more shit. I think it's a bad idea, but he's coming with me and being my meat shield, so I agree. My JNDad meets us in the living room and tears into me about making The Nose sad and how she was ""beside herself"" the last few days and how dare I? He can't understand why I dont speak to him and can't understand why I would do this to her. I ask if he ever does any introspection. He flat out says no.

Apparently TN hasn't been so completely beside herself because she tore into my office and sleeping area. She's moved all my belongings (including clothes, underwear etc), supplies, and tools around. The best part of it all? A note. She loves to write notes and leave them gingerly in places so that a dramatic read can be made. 

This note included her writing my post down, word for word, and THEN rewriting it and breaking down every single sentence with her own notes and annotations. I think the note is six pages. I haven't counted. I've only skimmed through it. It's vile. I'm going to leave it up to my future therapist.

What I saw was: her admitting to holding me down. Her asking me how much do I really remember. Calling me a liar. Calling me a sociopath. Saying I'm projecting. Saying she no longer cares about me and finally, I got what I wanted, I am all alone.

Swell.

Talking to someone with a psychology background recently, they mentioned The Nose sounds like she has borderline tendencies. I'll admit... yeah. It does. Its always been black or white, absolute love and adoration or hate. I never could connect to her. Anything and everything was held over my head no matter what age. 

I feel like this isn't it but also it might be. I feel there's a void in my life and I'm afraid to cut my parents out but I have always, always wanted to. I just want to get over this because I'm so tired of being emotionally labored all the time. Ugh.

79,Update to Memory Loss - DD2's Birthday and You've Got Mail,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb2eff240>,ImaginationCalls,0,11,176,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1535991218.0,9cmqro,"I'm naming my MIL Rose-Colored Glasses (RCG) unless it's been taken. She tends to look at all her behavior, no matter what, through these.

Due to weather, we moved DD2's party from the place we always have it to another location. This turned out to be a good thing. SIL came (invited) to the party bearing a large envelope full of smaller envelopes. All from RCG. Along with those, the information that yep - RCG had planned to just come to the party anyway. Thankfully, SIL told her party had been moved and would not say where, so we didn't have to deal with that.

I didn't tell DH about the envelope of envelopes until after the party and we'd gotten home. He opened it and found the following enclosed:

* Birthday card for DH (from July)
* Birthday card for DD2
* Birthday card for me
* Back to school cards(?) for DD1 and DD2, with $20 cash in each(?)
* A letter in a sealed envelope for DH
* An open letter with a weird clipart image on the side on cardstock

Not included - any form of card or gift for DD1's birthday WHICH WAS IN APRIL.

DH gave the girls their cards. I have chosen not to open mine and it will either be mailed back or ... ? IDK. I don't want her money. DH didn't open his birthday card but he did open the letter that was so full of rugsweeping rainbows and unicorns and POOR ME's that he almost didn't make it through the first paragraph. First, I will tell you what that weird clipart cardstock letter said:

\[DH\],I gave birth to you but you can with no instructions. All I knew was that I loved you long before I saw you. I know I made some mistakes and for that I am sorry, but I was doing the best I could with what I knew. Everything I did for you, I did from love. You are my child, my life, my dreams for tomorrow. I will always LOVE you and there is nothing that could destroy my love for you. Love- Mom

Got it? Cool. Onto letter #2, which I will add my own commentary to in parenthesis)

Dear \[DH\],

​

I really do not know what to say any more. I can understand about the \[phone company\] bill that I will continue to say I never received. *(This proving that she really still thinks this is about the goddamn money/credit score and it's NOT, it's about her refusing to acknowledge that it ever happened, that she was ever made aware of it, and her lying.)*  My question is; why you didn't say anything back in 2006*. (Well, probably because it fucking happened in 2012*?) It would have been taken care of*. (Just like all your other bills, right, RCG*?) I am paying you this back whether you want it for not. Enclosed is t he $145.00*. (It was actually $150, and STILL BESIDES THE FUCKING POIN*T) I never want to owe my kids money*. (She has asked to borrow thousands from both DH and SIL*.) So for me this is the end of the \[phone company\] conversation*. (Okay...*?)

I don't know if you realize this, I am not one to hold grudges. My problem is that I care too much at times. There are also times that I will trust the wrong people and get burned *(We know the feeling, girlfriend.*) I also will have to learn lessons the hard way. What I am saying is that I am not perfect *(ROFL)*. I am far from being perfect. You and \[SIL\] are my world. I always tried to do my best when it came to raising you two. To this day I feel I did the best I could. Again I will tell you that I am not perfect. I know I made some mistakes.

I want to tell you that I am sorry if I did wrong while you were growing up. I worried way too much. I had an extremely hard time of letting go. I love you more than life itself So for that I am sorry. I miss talking to you. I miss our friendship. I miss my son. I miss my daughter in law. I always wanted to be close with her *(hard pass)*. When I saw what you were dealing with, I wanted so bad to be there for you *(I recently have had some health issues, none of which would have been aided by her ""help"")* both. I wanted to be there with you when \[ImaginationCalls\] went through surgery *(there have been many - which time?)*. I wanted to help with \[DD1\] and \[DD2\]. All you had to do was pick up the phone and tell me you needed help. I would have been there for you*. (This makes me think maybe she thinks we are upset that we didn't have her help? IDK. We had plenty of help and were certainly fine*.) If I am such a bad person, do you think \[SIL\] would have me babysit \[Nephew2\]  when she went ba*ck to work? (Side story: SIL had to actually last-minute find someone else to babysit after a few weeks bc RCG wasn't changing him often enough even after SIL asked her to multiple times and Nephew2 wound up with terrible rashes and yeast issues, but those RCGs must have omitted that fact from her mind.) Do you think she would trust me enough to take \[Niece\] and \[Nephew1\] to school or get them on the bus? (SIL needs help with this stuff, and Niece is *almost 10 so...) I would love to have the same close relationship with you and \[ImaginationCalls\]. I want to be close with \[DD1\] and \[DD2\]. I want to come to things they have at school. Not once since they have started school have I been invited to anything they have participated in or when the*y have received awards. (Fake news. She has been invited 4 times. One she was so late the event was over before she arrived. 3 times she flaked completely AFTER promising my gi*rls she would be there). All I am guilty of is loving my family with all my heart. I am guilty of wanting to be in your life. I never understood when my mom would tell me that she loved me more than y*ou know until after she passed away (Yep. You'll* die one day. We know. Subtle, RCG.) I learned that no matter what a Mother's love never dies. I\[t\] goes on forever. So no matter how mad you are and no matter how long you will hold this grudge, I will always love you more than you know.

Love you! Mom

So wow. DH doesn't know what he's going to do with the $. He's hurt and upset that she doesn't get it and mad she is trying to guilt him. I'm worried this is only going to escalate over the holidays.

Anyway, I'm hoping SIL will no longer be playing messenger. She seems like she doesn't understand DH's stance either and IDK if it's him not articulating it clearly enough (I consider myself fluent in DHnese but even I get lost at times) or she's got her own set of glasses."
80,Thunder Theif and the Weekend Intrusion,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb2ec4898>,mamabear727,0,17,62,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536010071.0,9cpema,"It's been a few since I've posted, but I've decided to call my mom Thunder Thief. I cant recall who suggested the name, but thank you so much! 

TT is the one who takes all of our experiences with DS. She announced my pregnancy to all my friends, announced DS birth on Facebook, gave him cheesecake at 4 fricken months, etc. 

TT used to babysit 2 full days a week and one evening while DH and I were out. We've enrolled DS in a daycare, so now she is down to one evening a week, and one full day of babysitting. I feel that this is plenty of quality time. Wrong....

TT frequently mentions how she misses watching him twice a week and wants to spend EVERY weekend with us. I feel like that's too excessive, so this weekend when she asked us what we were up to, we politely said we were busy all weekend.

 DS goes to a weekly class on Sundays. We get a text from TT that morning asking if DS is going to class that day. We tell her that he might,  if he wakes up from his nap in time. We go to the class, everything is fun and great,  no TT.

Monday rolls around and TT is finally visiting. 

TT: So did DS go to class yesterday? 

Me: yes, he woke up from his nap really late but we were able to make it.

TT: he's in the ""name she shouldnt know because I've never told her"" class right?

Me: uh.... yea why.

TT: well I was across the street at the gym that morning and I stopped by class to see if you guys were there. Then I remembered he's in the ""name she shouldnt know"" class and I was there an hour early. I would have waited but I didn't want to wait for you guys if you weren't coming that day so I went home.

WTF.... Translation....so you just went to the building, looked up his class like a stalker, and then were going to wait around.... for over an hour for us to show up. UNINVITED.  We tell you we're busy all weekend, but you're just going to barge into our DS's class uninvited anyway. 

Then today when its finally time for her visit, we tell her to come for dinner at 5:30. Ya'll she showed up, unannounced,  2 and a half hours early while I'm literally in my pajamas repainting the kitchen! She gets here and I just continue to clean up while she's all ""come give Gramma  kisses!!!!!"" To my one year old. Because she does this all the time, she doesnt think about DS's schedule, so after 30 minutes of visiting, it's time for his nap. 

DH and I take DS to his room and he cries because he hates getting his diaper changed when he's tired. TT is complaining ""awww he's crying he wants to stay with Gramma"" and my DH (Oh how I love him) just closes the door in her face. 

This pales in comparison to what I've been reading on here lately, but this crap and worse happens all the time. She comes over without warning and just walks into our home or invites herself on our outings. This isn't the worst thing she's done by a long shot, it's just the most recent.... thanks if you made it this far!"

YOU helped me support *him* ignoring his own mom. 

Yes, I still struggle to try to bound with her. But I have a good year under my belt of not using SO to talk to her or enable her.

Two weeks! Bitch bot has our rambling story, but pretty much SO and I don't value traditional weddings. We've both been in enough wedding parties to see how *more* fun (for us) it is to stand with bride/groom versus being bride/groom. We want to get married for tax and insurance reasons. After sharing our ""engagement"" with family, we've discussed all avenues of ceremony. We went from small destination wedding, to vegas, to courthouse. All our attempts were to give family *some* celebration because we DGAF. At each step we were met with criticism and offers of upgrading.

So they win. Wedding is planned for next year. MIL gets her ceremony with flowers and vows, and my dad gets to invite everyone I've met briefly since I was born. They win. Plan your wedding yall.

Cause that's all it is at this point. *Their* wedding. And you know what? SO and I are super excited for it! We're getting married in a civil ceremony two weeks from now, at our county court house. It's a secret, no one knows! Out closest couple friends will stand with us then we're hitting the county fair after. I AM SO EXCITED TO GET MARRIED THIS WAY.

The brewery we originally wanted to attend after elopement will now be the reception venue for wedding next year. It's like a costume party where I get to be bride.

Knowing we're getting married in two weeks **our way** has made next years wedding feel stress free, and *fun.* 

We could not have got here without this sub, thank you!"
83,"Update: My JNMiL is living here now... (long post, drama llamas)",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfaceebc18>,Mistress_Jedana,0,74,263,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1535981467.0,9clhi2,"Check BB for what's been going on, if you like.  A bit of drama, and I've been battling migraines all week long. Some family drama in here, but all relates to the MIL issue.

So, last week, we said my JNMiL could come and live with us.  She's been couch surfing for at least the last couple of years, going from grandchild to grandchild to cousins or siblings or their kids.

I posted on FB that she was coming, asked for any advice/help.  I also posted I was a bit frustrated, as she is not well and hasn't been taking care of herself, and I was going to end up being a caretaker yet again (as I was for DH during his 10 years of hell).  I also said that I think it's going to be a hard time for us for awhile, as neither side really knows the other (having only ever physically been around her less than the fingers on my hands).   I did not once call her any names, make any negative comments about her or her family; this post solely centered on my thoughts and feelings and what was coming.

I will point out here that the only people on my FB page are people I actually know;  like 50 people and most of that is family.  I don't even have all of my family on there, because I don't want to deal with their shit even online.  I thought I had blocked off all of DH's family (because I have zero use for their shit, even less than my own family) years ago, but I missed one of his nieces.

Well, his niece popped onto my post and started threatening me.  Then my dumbass sister (who can't keep her damn nose out of anything) started on her.   So...I blocked the niece and put my sister in FB timeout for 30 days.  The niece called her mommy (who is now officially bipolar, and having seizures, and lives with a random guy in his semi) and then they brought the drama to the rest of DH's family.  As they couldn't contact me (since none of them have my phone number and I blocked them on FB years ago), they contacted my fucking daughters on their FB.  DH's sister went as far as contacting my teenage son, telling him to have his dad call her because his 'bitch of a mom' is ignoring her.    Both my girls told them all to fuck right off and blocked them as well (and when his sister called my middle kid 'little J (my name)', she proudly posted on her FB page that she would like to be called 'little J' from here on out.  Hell, my sons-in-law both laughed at that shit, and said they can only hope their wives turn out like me.  /blush

DH and I had a very long talk when he got home, and he has ignored every attempt at his family to contact him since.  He said he doesn't need their drama, and he has my back.  He did tell his sister that if she ever pulled that shit again, he'd let me loose on her.  He also told her she didn't want to start shit with any of my kids, because they were trained by the best (he means me!) and would rip her dumb ass to shreds.    He earned his happy time that day, haha.

We showed up to where his mom has been staying on Saturday.  She didn't tell them that we were coming to get her, because she didn't think we were coming.  So, we got what stuff she had there (4 bags of clothes, that's all she has in the world) and brought her home.  She didn't even have a toothbrush.   She was sleeping a recliner in front of a tv in the living room...Eight people (5 adults, 3 kids), 3 bedroom house, 1 bathroom; one elderly adult in a wheelchair, one elderly adult barely able to walk, 2 grown adults who smoke constantly, a 19 year old adult/kid, a 10 year old kid and a 5 year old kid with Cystic Fibrosis, who is trying to get on the lung transplant list, plus MIL.  The kids all shared a room (yeah, 19 boy, 10 boy, 5 girl); the other two elderly share a room (they are MIL's siblings) and then the adults share a room.

Here, she has her own bedroom, a twin bed with a very good mattress (was DS's and is less than 4 months old; we upgraded him to a Full bed); she has my old 40"" tv w/cable box (DS was using it; we're buying him a new one for his birthday next month).   We bought her a flip phone (her choice, big number buttons) so she has her own phone line to call her family; I gave her my old Kindle, made her an email and a FB account so she can contact her family that way.   We are getting her a shower chair, and will put that in our bathroom (as we have a walk in shower, and it would be safer for her to shower in there than in other bathroom, which has a regular tub/shower set up).

DH calls her 'an emotional terrorist', and I see why.  She is so passive aggressive with her comments, and it's already driving us all nuts.  DH and I are presenting a united front (any disagreements will happen in the privacy of our bedroom or the car) and he has told his family to entirely fuck right off and to not contact him again.

He's taking her next Friday to open a bank account, as her SS checks get deposited to an account she shares with her daughter (so all her money has been being hijacked by that cunt); he'll be on the account with her, but we aren't touching a penny of it.  That's for her to use to get what she needs/wants or pay for medical stuff; we're covering living expenses and most food costs for her.    He's trying to figure out what she has for medical coverage, and what we need to get started for her; I don't think she even has her social security card or a picture id.   This is gonna suck.  


ETA:  fixed what was wrong with the little kid; had the wrong thing listed"
84,Bette Crawford was actually violent (tw: child abuse),<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb2e9e8d0>,MadHatter06,0,10,105,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1535997007.0,9cnkqz,"I’ve told before about how weird Bette Crawford was when it came to sex. At the same time, what she’d let us watch (old movies that didn’t exactly hide sex stuff) made it seem like she was okay with all that. Maybe it was just part of her crazy making, I don’t know. 

I added the tw as a just in case. This was the only time she actually got physically abusive with me. But unfortunately it wasn’t a surprise. I had realized years before this that she was always on the edge of abusive. I think the only thing that kept that from happening was that with our social circle, it wouldn’t have been easy to hide, since we were seeing people outside of family 3-4 times a week. She couldn’t have hid if we were bruised and battered.

This happened when I was 12. Now this was many moons ago, but you expect that by 12, a girl has at least a little knowledge of what sex between adults is. I had very vague understanding, since Bette did her best to completely shelter me and keep me ignorant and babied. A friend was over, and we were playing with Barbies. Yeah, I was probably close to outgrowing that, but this incident pushed that. We have Ken and Barbie living their lives, married, working, and all that Jazz. And so in this little story, Barbie and Ken come home, have dinner... and then its business time. Basically they had their clothes off and were in the bed. That’s it.

Bette comes busting into my room for no reason. Startles me so bad I literally jumped to my feet. She looks down, sees the dolls, and I watch her face. I know in that moment that I’m dead. She says something to me and my friend and leaves. My friend can’t understand why I’m shaking at this point, but I know that as soon as my friend is gone, I’m gonna get in so much trouble.

Sure enough, Bette waits. After my friend is gone, and after I’ve gotten ready for bed, she comes in and shuts the door. I didn’t realize the significance of that at the time, but now I know she didn’t want my dad or brother to hear any of this. They would have put a stop to her plan. She starts demanding to know WHY we were playing with our dolls that way, WHO taught me about that, and WHO had the idea to play that way?!? Again, I’m 12, with very vague knowledge, but I do know that married folks get in bed, get naked, and do... something. I seriously had no real knowledge, which is rather sad in itself.

So she grabs the dolls and basically wants me to reenact the entire play leading up to that. This was another one of her favorite tactics, demanding to know everything leading up to something and then exploding when you don’t remember every detail, declaring that it meant you were lying. No Bette, some people just don’t record the minutes of every interaction and action like it’s a business meeting. So I’m trying, but by this point I’m tired, I’m scared, and I’m trying to figure out what she wants from me and how much trouble I’m in. When I can’t give her detailed breakdowns, she grabs the Ken doll and throws it. At my face. From less than a foot away. Hits me square in the nose.

In that moment, I remember wishing so badly that she broke my nose. Why? Because I knew that otherwise, no one would believe that this happened and she would feign innocence. 

Bette demands again that I show her. When I can’t, she does it again. It happened FOUR times. She deliberately picked up a toy and threw it at the same spot on my face four times.

The next few days were a total mess. She was screwing with my head at that point. In front of other people she acted just fine, like nothing was wrong. Two nights later, the same thing happened. She comes in, shuts the door, and the interrogations begin again. The day after, everything was peachy.

After this, she “decided” that since I was old enough to know about sex, I was too old to play with barbies and ordered that I box them up. They stayed in those boxes till seven years later, when some younger relatives came over and began playing. Turning to me, Bette, in this light half laughing tone, asked me why ever did I stop playing with Barbies. I went stone cold and reminded her that she made me stop. She laughed, said “Oh yeah”, and walked away.

I tried for years to understand. Did she think I was being molested? Why was she so angry? But none of her questions were about if someone was harming me. No, she was asking about tv shows, about friends, about movies. She loved to sudden declare something was “inappropriate” and forbid it, keeping me from either fitting in with others my age or just making me seem weird and an outsider. She loved me being an outcast. I now understand she was looking to shut me off from more of the world. She wouldn’t have cared if I had been harmed, since she never cared when I said someone made me uncomfortable. When that happened I was mocked and basically told that I had no reason to feel that way and to suck it up. 

She never got physically violent with me again. But I always knew that she had the ability to do so.

TL:DR : Bette whapped me with a toy four times and then pretended like she was a doting mother."
85,She didn't stop until the last second.,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb2eaf6a0>,WellUpholsteredLady,0,27,847,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1535956843.0,9cj793,"I first posted here because my MIL was driving me crazy. She's an awesome woman with some BEC moments, but when FH (now DH!) and I finally decided, after ten years together, to tie the knot, she started to wander into JNO territory. 


The gist of it is, both DH and I have very large immediate families, and earn maybe 1/4 what his siblings and their partners earn. The fancy circus his older sister and his brother had were out of the question. FH suggested we elope, but tell people early to give them time to adjust so that things could settle down before the big day. MILs immediate reactions was to pin the whole idea on me: ""if it's what *you* want, WUL, of course, I know FH would do anything for *you*, and I supposed if it's how *the bride* wants to do it..."" FH stayed silent and let me take the brunt of her disappointment. Eventually, it morphed into allowing four guests: our parents.


But that wasn't enough. MIL asked us, ""Are you *suuure* you can't invite your brothers and sisters?"" Insisting certain relatives would never speak to us again if we didn't invite them. I held firm. Parents only. 


""Are you *suuure* SIL3 and 4 can't be there? We'll remortgage the house to pay...."" Again, no. I have five siblings, all with partners, some with kids. FH has five siblings, most with partners, some with kids. I will not pick and choose, and I cannot afford to have them all there. 


FH began to ask me ""if we're sure we can't squeeze in just a few siblings"" and I asked him how we choose. Why, the ones who can afford to pay to be added on! Which means his entire family and none of mine. I almost left him there and then, but he realised his mistake when I handed him my phone and instructed him to call my sister's and tell them they are too poor to invite to my wedding. After that he had my back- PARENTS ONLY.


Eventually things went quiet, and honestly my mother, JellyBaby became the main source of all my issues. MIL was still flapping about ""Are you *suuure* you can't invite your siblings?"" But she was largely just ignored. She pressed us to tell people way sooner than we had planned, becsuse she felt ""sooo guilty"" knowing our secret. Eventually she outright dictated that certain peiple be told right then and there, which we know to be a cover up because she'd already told them, and I was angry for a bit. 


And then the big day. MIL got stressed about travelling, her hotel wasn't good enough, she worried about the heat- all BEC that no one paid attention to and pretty soon she perked up and actually had a great time. She became the MIL I'd loved before all this again. She supported me where JellyBaby was absent. She said kind things and was just generally lovely the whole time. It's been two weeks and she remains that same lovely woman again.


But it's never that simple, is it? Apparently, two days before we flew out to marry, MIL called DH up and asked him, one last time, if he was *suuure* he couldn't find space for his two younger sister's, because they would be *so sad* to miss this, and MIL just felt *so guilty* leaving them behind. 


I didn't hear it, I was told about it later, and DH apparently reminded her that she chose to have six kids, he isn't going to choose two over the others, and he can't afford the last.minute changes to all our bookings. I fear this will be something she never gets over, but I don't care as long as DH keeps practising his shiny spine.

1) She and my GrandFIL saying “And god bless Trump! And screw Hillary!” at the end of a dinner toast, making direct eye contact with me (the only known “liberal” in the family).  
2) Telling me every single things about me that could use fixin’. And I mean EVERY SINGLE THING. She criticized my GODDAMN EARRING PLACEMENT, basically criticizing MY EARLOBES.  
3) Tried to tell my adorable little cousin that the story of The Tower of Babel was fact because it came from the Bible, then called me a “Doubting Thomas” when I pointed out that the languages of ancient history came from at least SIX different corners of the world and that Babel is figurative. I feel so bad for my cousin. He’s only seven, but he’s bright, and they’re going to indoctrinate him.  
4) Criticizing my eating habits. I am a teen, 5’3”, and I weigh 98 fucking pounds. Trust me, bitch, I can handle TWO BROWNIES.  
5) Tried to talk my ear off about how eeeeevil Planned Parenthood is. Knows full well I support them.  
6) Told me she was so vewy sowwy for how she acted at Christmas and said she “cwied for daaays.” Acted the exact same way she did at Xmas (which I attend to be nice to my family despite the fact that I am a Jewish convert).  
I cannot WAIT to tell this bitch that I am a Jewish bisexual with a girlfriend and a good life outside the evangelical church bubble. As soon as I’m independent, I’m doing it. Sorry for the rant, everyone.

Short recap: My ExILs thought I was laundering money for the Russian mob. Police were called, not a whole lot  (read:NOTHING) happened on the legal side of stuff.

After my last post is the time when, to the best of my knowledge, my ExILs started to shop around for divorce attorneys. Not for them, you see, but for my ExD(amn)H.

​

(insert Spongebob Narrator Voice): 6. Months. Later

​

They waited until I was in the hospital.  The nurses wouldn't let them serve me. (Bless them omg). This all means that upon exiting the hospital, I got divorce papers with my exit paperwork. Oh, and no job, 'cause my ExDH was so busy with his lawyer, he couldn't call \[place of employment\] to let them know I wouldn't be there.

MIL is the one who put me in the Hospital IN THE FIRST PLACE. By telling the police I was suicidal (have not ever been, but my heart goes out to those who are so much in that space).

I wanted to post an update about meeting my boyfriend's mom! 

All in all, she seems mostly a Yes....but there are some JustNo tendencies. It's obvious she loves both of her boys, so there was no picking favorites, although she's highly aware of the fact that my boyfriend is the more difficult of the two. He's a high energy, does-what-he-wants guy and she did give me pointers as to how to wrangle him in if he gets to be too much. 

She told him I am perfect and not to lose me or she'd be very upset. She was kind, welcoming, and gave us space as a couple. She even told me she doesn't ever go downstairs to the boys' rooms as that's not her space. All of these seem to point towards a JustYes, but time will tell. 

There was some ""babe"" comments thrown in here and there and it made me uncomfortable...and the caveat to that is she did it with both her sons and her husband, so it wasn't a unique thing to just my boyfriend. 

Again, time will tell. And I will definitely be on the lookout for more as I spend more and more time with the family!

It was the summertime, so potato salad and burgers were on the menu. This was before the big confrontations came to a head.

*If you're new to my posts, I use a made-up acronym called T.I.M.S. to help set the stage.*

Timeline: years ago

Intensity:  for some reason, I keep getting Paul Young/Mark Moses offering more mashed potatoes stuck in my head. You know he's looking out for his kid, but good god that character is creepy.

MILdar: temporarily under repairs

Spine STR: squishy, kinda like mashed potatoes

Dad and I had come back from a long bike ride on the trails, so our appetites were ready to go. As we sat down, it was mostly pleasant conversation ... that is, until DW reached for a second helping of potato salad. 

Now, CBF is foreign to CTHD - after all, it would cause wrinkles. Instead, CTHD made her opinions … well, they were clear, she didn’t have the nerve to say them out loud. Just a bunch of loud humming and staring daggers at DW for daring to take a few more calories than she did. Having the shitty radar that I did at the time, I didn't notice the passive aggressive stuff going on. The topic of conversation turned over to calorie counting on the burgers we were eating. There was some justifiable context behind this (Dad and I asking if we burned enough to earn this).

And then? Ho, boy. CTHD moved the conversation over to how her being a militant calorie counter enabled her to remain as skinny as she is in her late 50s. She was straight up bragging about how skinny she was to an audience of people that, under normal circumstances, would not care. Look around the table. Your husband of 30+ years, kids, grandson and daughter-in-law. Who are you trying to impress?

DW pulled me aside a day or two after this and asked me lean on CTHD to refrain from bragging and pushing calorie counting in her presence. She had enough of that growing up around her parents, who insisted from about age 10 that she watch everything she eat. I followed through, but CTHD‘s response? “Fine, but seriously? I can’t even talk about calories and eating around her? Is she really that sensitive?”"

The letter content is amusingly full of what I assume she thinks are triggers, bits of things she repeated a lot to me as a child.  

And the part that bothers me most.  *IF*, *If* I ever felt judged by her, she writes.  And blames it on immaturity.  

Took 60 years to become mature, eh?  

But seriously, no ""if"" here.  She was always very plain and obvious, literally telling me verbatim I wasn't a good person, not a good mormon, certainly.  

...  

Husband snuggled me and read it with me, snorted when I did, and said he's suffered through ""praise letters"" from his mom too.  Obviously I know all the schmaltz was supposed to press buttons and he can't recognize these particular things...  I was angry at the ""*IF*"" bit and got a teensy strangulated sounding.  

He asks me if it choked me up and so I admitted yes, but ""in disgust"", to which he asked, ""but why?"" I made a puke face, feeling like not answering anymore.  I need to talk to my therapist about it, husband isn't a professional and doesn't really grasp the extent of what I have tried to communicate about my childhood.  Even though his was overtly worse on the surface, my parents ""play nice"" so exceedingly well...  

Communication.  I suck at it.  And this letter deserves a reply, but also deserves nothing.  

""IF.""

91,Update to Giada's prison situation.,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb2dcfda0>,anonymousmousegirl,0,245,2421,False,JUSTNOMIL,that busty cake peddler,1535929746.0,9cgf30,"Just a short/vague update that I am allowed to post.

Giada's date for early release is coming up and it is pretty much guaranteed that she will serve the full sentence. She has been in a few ""scuffles"" with other inmates and one with a CO. In a bit of karma, she looks like she has gained about 25-30 pounds which puts her right at a healthy weight but must be killing her. Her hair is also growing in thicker, but only in patches so she looks eerily similar to [this](https://goo.gl/images/2KqBtQ).

She has also taken to playing the victim instead of acting proud of her actions. Everything is my fault because I made her feel insecure about her place in her baaaaabby boooys life. She ""deeply regrets allowing [Mouse's] behavior to dictate her actions."" I really don't know what the fuck that is in reference to. Did I breathe too loud? Love my ex too much? Set too many boundaries? Oh, I know. It was my slutty hair. Damn my whorish curls for making her plan to fucking *assault me at my job*.

As for the sexual abuse, she is claiming that she couldn't help falling in love with her son and is blaming it on a health issue that she's trying to get testing to prove. So. There's that. I have a feeling the only thing any medical tests will prove is that she has a black hole where her heart should be."
92,A Tale of Too Stupid (or: The Time My Mother Lied About Going Blind),<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb2eb5160>,byacolate,0,27,200,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1535976229.0,9ckxkl,"This one's a bit of a novel, folks, but it’s jam packed with twists, turns, and the coveted Real Email Quotes. This one goes out to those of you who, like me, love a good ol' wall-o'-text. Here's the story of how three years ago my mother was super duper definitely going blind with a disease she would not name.

​

This was not the first time she went against my explicit wishes and broke NC, nor would it be the last. It was, however, both the most ridiculous and stressful for yours truly.

​

As I'm sure you all know, they test the waters at the start. If they go whole hog crazy from the get go they know they've lost you. I was going on two full years of no contact and an entire ocean away. I'd just started my dream job - a culmination of every single job I'd always wanted as a child compact into one. Barring the boundary-stomping breach of NC, her email was reasonable enough: would I like to be written in her will as my youngest brother’s guardian in the event of her death?

​

This had indeed been a private wish of mine many times, but I never thought it would truly be a possibility; for that reason alone, I responded. Yes thank you, that sounds agreeable to me.

​

And now that she had her foot in the door and I was talking back for the first time in two years, she thought I'd be quite open and interested in hearing aaaaall about her life, her hardships, her triumphs.

​

When this did not, in fact, garner the reaction she was hoping for (read: any), she switched back to her successful bid for conversation. But she had to come at it with something new and fresh. She had to get to the root of her motives. Slowly but surely “would you like me to put you in my will"" turned to “I'm going blind and you need to take your brother asap.”

​

Now I know what you're thinking - oho, here's a classic narc move that only fools and mortals would fall for. And believe me, though a fool and mortal I am, I did not believe her. Some quick research into this terrible debilitating blinding disease she may possibly potentially theoretically have, was incredibly slow to progress, incredibly easy to treat, and really primarily affected elderly people of an ethnicity not our own. This easily dismissed lie was not what made me hesitate, but the clear, true motive behind this crusade: she was tired of taking care of my baby brother.

​

Let me give you a brief background: I have four younger siblings by a smorgasbord of parents, but of my mother's children I have two brothers. For the convenience of you acronym-and-anonymity-loving goofs and to reflect the nature of my relationships with them, I will refer to the younger as BB (Baby Brother, 13 years younger) and BRO (Brother, Really Oughttacliphistoenails, 2 years younger). Growing up, I was very much BB’s second parent - his father was gone like the wind and with him absent, my mother fell back to her old habits of treating me as her emotional spouse. I was the one in the hospital room with my mother when she gave birth to him - I even wore the “Father” bracelet. At thirteen, I was the youngest person at that hospital to observe a c-section. I was happy to do it (I was comfortable in the emotional spouse role - it was a place I was most familiar with, her brief stints with weird men and shoving me into the neat little box labeled Child being the uncomfortable drifting place for me emotionally), and proud to be that person. I also had the honor a lot of MILS here claw their way through space and time to secure: I was the first person to lay eyes on a child that was not mine in the traditional, healthy sense.

​

For the first five years of BB’s life, I raised him. He was the light of my life, and the hardest part of leaving. He was the awful sacrifice that had to be made to be NC with my mother.

​

And here's another thing: At the time of these emails, I had only a couple months previously managed to convince Bro to leave her. It was a long tooth-and-nail struggle and a story for another time, but once he'd moved several states away, I'd effectively managed to rob her of not one source of free labor but two.

​

So with that in mind, I'm sure you can understand how easily the dots connected. Without the free childcare services of her built-in slaves, she had to actually use her child support to support her child. And she was not McLovin it. (Obligatory disclaimer: I am very very well aware of the stigma against single mothers who receive child support, and it's abhorrent. My mother is the outlier in that she really was extremely greedy, manipulative, and spiteful regarding child support. Prime example: when Bro escaped her clutches, she continued demanding child support for him from our father.... who he lived with. While he was starting college. That he was paying for out of pocket.)

​

I did not believe she had any debilitating ailments that made it impossible to care for BB - I knew that, much worse, she was simply tired of him. It broke my heart and terrified me. She’d made many, many poor choices for him already (not life-threatening but severely isolating and detrimental to his education); now she just wanted him gone.

​

I was torn by protectiveness for my BB, and knowing that if I agreed to take him, this taste of freedom I'd had for the first time in my life would be gone forever. I have always intended to be child-free for many reasons, a large one being her doing: I'd spent my childhood raising kids. Maybe in adulthood I could finally live for myself. Once I was grown and gone, I wouldn't be restrained by the needs of a child, and none of the money I made would be confiscated by my mother. This would all change. Which, of course, she knew, and was part two of her scheme.

​

I’ve dug up old emails for you all to relive full narc experience with me, verbatim. You may or may not be shocked to know that the roller coaster above, after the innocuous will email, happened in a single email.

​

“I know it seems unlikely that you would be needed to care for \[BB\], but here's the situation. In \[State\] I saw an ophthalmologist who diagnosed me with a degenerative eye disease.  She said it's something that causes \[easily treatable ailment\]. She also said it may stay dormant or it may get worse, there's no way to tell. I feel like it's getting worse. As soon as my health insurance kicks in next month I plan to see a specialist out here. I say all this to let you know the time for someone to care for \[BB\] may come sooner than we like to think. If you're not up to the task, I need to know. If you don't want the responsibility I need to know that too. I'm not ok with you taking him to another country though, so we need to be able to communicate. If you can't or won't do that, I need to make other arrangements. Please let me know your real thoughts, not just your condescension. I know you don't care what happens to me but if all you feel is bitterness toward me I'll look elsewhere. I don't want my son raised by someone who despises his mother. That's not healthy for \[BB\].”

​

This bold and very stupid mother of mine.

​

This was, in fact, not simply a means to dump the burden of motherhood onto her daughter, but to trap her with it to regain control. This was perhaps 15% parental laziness on her part, and 85% power struggle with me. Folks, it takes two to tango, and up to this point I'd let her lead. But now her ass was out and it was my turn.

​

Here is the exact progression of the events to follow, with some added commentary by yours truly.

​

**Me:** “This is a big question. It'll take time for me to answer. And I need some more specifics: What exactly is this disease? What sort of time frame are we looking at for everything involved?”

​

**JNM**: “I have no idea on the time frame. As I said, it depends on the disease's progression. I've moved twice since the diagnosis, so I don't remember the name...sounds like you think I'm lying to you. Good grief! I'm not that desperate for contact with anyone.  Take whatever time you need. I'll start checking into a backup plan.” *(Good grief! Sounds like you know I’m full of horseshit! Sounds like I can’t give you the name of the disease I don’t have! Good grief! Can you believe she really thought she was sneaky with that halfass ‘checking into a backup plan’ threat? “Baby Brother™ is limited edition, and they’re going fast! These deals are a steal! Get ‘em before they’re gone forever!”)*

​

So I let this stew for a while - I was mad, and I adhere to a couple of very helpful rules regarding making choices soaked in emotion: if it's a small decision, like a risky text or a purchase, give it ten minutes. Think it over. Let it simmer. Does it need to be done? Does the benefit outweigh the cost? If it's still The Right Choice in ten minutes, get it done. For big life-changing decisions, sleep on it.

​

Well I slept on this one for a couple (11) days.

​

**Me**: “I should have an answer for you come October (*these were sent in August*). It's been a busy couple weeks, and I'm only now able to start checking some things out. I should have some things figured out within a month.”

​

**JNM**: “Oh, ok. I thought you'd decided the answer is no. No rush. Like I said, I don't know where I stand progression -wise until I go to the ophthalmologist. I took the day off work Friday though, as it seemed everything was being seen through water. Yesterday was a good day. Today isn't too bad. One day at a time \[cutesy smiley emoji she doesn’t deserve to use\].”

​

Months passed. I’m a woman of my word, so when October rolled around I did indeed get back to her. I’d spoken to many trusted people in my life - adults, mentors, friends, and had decided on a course of action that I thought was agreeable... if it were spoken with a person actually suffering from a disease that needed treatment (spoiler alert three years later: she wasn’t, so it didn’t). The nature of my response was essentially a compromise: I would take him for a period of time that would allow her to get treatment. I was very cordial and professional in my message and had extended an olive branch.

​

Her response to this paragraph and all the hubbub that followed looked like this:

​

**JNM, answering no questions answered and not responding to a single thing I’d said:** “Where are you now?”

​

I answered. She wanted to know if I was planning to return soon, and where I’d be.

​

**Me**: “I'm not positive yet. *(I was. In fact, I’d spent two months researching. The best place I could figure was my father’s thriving city for many reasons, including having a support system. She has no support system because she has alienated everyone in her life.)* I'd like to ask if you've enrolled him back into school yet.”

​

Remember those poor isolating life decisions I mentioned earlier? My mother had moved BB out to the middle of nowhere and had decided to home-school him. With the proper credentials and thorough socialization by other means, I’m sure some people manage to make homeschooling a positive and healthy choice for their kids. My mother was not accredited in any way, had no time to perform the duties necessary to homeschool a child, and absolutely would not take the time out of her day to make sure he was building his social skills with children his age.

​

**JNM, who thinks she is very clever despite having done the above:** “Oh no. I've decided he'd do better and learn everything a small boy needs to know working as a ranch hand. He works sun up to sun down. It's a hard life but it builds character.”

​

Bold words from a talking hemorrhoid.

​

Let me tell you something about my mother: she is very well educated, very smart, very manipulative and sly. She is also very greedy. In fact, so greedy that it makes her dumb as a box of rocks. Greed is kryptonite to her brain functions. She’s made many enormous, moronic, and enormously moronic life decisions because of this; she’s turned herself into a caricature of villainy because of this; she’s stolen from her children because of this.

​

I did not grow up surviving her without becoming a little crafty myself. And I did not spend the last two months with my thumbs in my ass. I found peace in the outcome I knew would come to pass after I sent the following message:

​

**Me**: “Good. That was one of the two things I felt I needed to mention; I wanted him to be back up to speed with school before he had to transition into living in a new place with new people as well. There was that, and then there's child support. While I have him, I'll need it. I thought two years might be more preferable to you as opposed to several because you might find in two years that you would prefer that financial help as well.  I would normally assume that this was a given, and I'm entirely uncomfortable talking about it at all, but please understand that from my perspective, the last few years we lived together have made me cautious about our relationship and money. “

​

This bold, stupid mother of mine surveyed her kingdom not one second more. I was still committing to take the responsibility of raising a child for her, had not outright shut down her demand for contact, and quite fortunately for her she would not be blind to see it happen. The moment this came with a price tag?:

​

**JNM**: “You know what? You've made it a point to not have a relationship with me the past several years. (*True*) I've respected your decision. (*False*) I care less than nothing about the child support (***Very*** *false*) and would of course expect anyone raising my son to have the resources to do so. By that I mean I would naturally contribute. I thought you would be the logical choice to raise \[BB\] if I couldn't. I'm not so sure about that anymore. You're still young and I think you should have the opportunity to enjoy your youth. (*Interesting that this is the moment of epiphany. Thank you! Thank you! I lay myself at your feet for this mercy!*) I gave mine to you and \[Bro\]\* (classy, blaming your children for making the decision to have th\*em), and while I'll never regret that, it sure wasn't a lot of fun for any of us. Have a wonderful time \[Byacolate\]. My friend \[lady I met once\] has agreed to stand in the gap for me if and when the time comes for me to get help raising \[BB\]. I appreciate your consideration. \[BB\] and I love you more than you know and we pray for you nightly.”

​

And that, essentially, was that. Another email apiece was exchanged: I, being a shithead myself, needed to lay out a little oh goodness! How very strange that your mind changes so suddenly when money is concerned! And she in turn responded with a wall of text that, frankly, I genuinely did not remember her sending at all until I read a few choice gems that I’ll share with you here at the end of our journey:

* “You and your grandmother (*who informs me of any information regarding BB because she is the only family my JNM speaks to*) don't know much about my living situation because you don't ask, and when Grandma B asks she accuses me of being manipulative because I don't whitewash it and just say everything is fine. I know you perceive me the same way. Believe me, I fully comprehend the fact that the only person who doesn't perceive me as superfluous is \[BB\].” *(Superfluous is the kindest possible word I'd ever use for you. Also, yikes!)*
* “Grandma B told me, ""\[BB\] is welcome to come live with me. \[JNM\], I'm sure you will find a way to survive."" In other words, he was welcome with her; I was not. Other family members offered similar deals: \[BB\] was welcome but I was not. Between \[exBF\], you, \[Bro\], and your Grandmother, it almost broke me. I had a plan for ending it if I was such a failure that I couldn't provide for \[BB\].” (*very classy. I am, of course, supposed to conveniently forget that she just lied to me about something as serious as a debilitating disease and tried to bully me into contact with her again.)*
* “What you all meant for evil (*Having and asserting boundaries*), God meant for and turned into something good \[...\]  I believe BB and I are here, in \[Bumfuck Nowhere\] because this is where we're meant to be....all those other experiences have led us right here. Because I believe that I can forgive you for the pain, tears, etc you've caused me.” (*well thank god for that!)*
* “I don't intend to relinquish my rights and contact with him (*naturally she did catch that I’d never agreed to be on speaking terms with her again, because that’s what she was after all along*), which seems to be your expectation (*I said nothing to her about this. That was very much the point.*). Regardless of my situation I will be a part of his life and upbringing until I have no breath left in me, or until he makes the decision to turn his back on me after the age of 18. That's how it is when you love someone and are committed to them.”

You can rest absolutely assured that it is my full intention to give him the tools turn his back on you, you sentient gargoyle. Choke."
93,Hell Beast and Divorce. Realisation.,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb2dcf438>,Blurryblanket,0,102,397,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1535962350.0,9cjpaq,"So I haven't posted much lately. Don't worry there is in fact updates, but I don't have the energy to write them up fully. I've made a few attempts to write up the updates, but alas my anxiety gets the better of me and I delete them before I post. So I promise I'll get to everything soon (before next week, as I will be seeing HB face to face for the first time since Easter 2017), but more on that at a later date.

I've recently started seeing a good psychologist to go through all the crap Hell Beast has done. And going through all of that has been tough, but in doing so, I've remembered so many super shitty and messed up stuff that I guess I tried to forget.

But anyway, onto this post.
My partner and I connected some dots recently about Hell Beast.

A bit of background is needed:
Hell Beast used to be generally JustYes, while my father was JustNo. Eventually HB got fed up with my Dad and booted him out (generally he worked, came home and drank until he passed out in front of the tv, on occasion slapping us kids if we played too loud or did bad shit. Amongst other stuff). I was like 5 when this happened.

Took a few years, but my dad turned out very JustYes, while HB slowly reverted to JustNo. In all this time, they hated each other, never speaking (even though he had visitation), my dad mellowed after a few years, but HB's hatred just grew. The first time they had spoken since face to face was my graduation when I was 18.

So now, in all this time, Hell Beast never divorced my dad. She took him to court and took almost 20k dollars from him (his Super fund and she used to gloat about it), and then again many years later. According to my dad, she also tried to take him to court to get his assets valued and cut her a check for half of  whatever they were worth (many years after they had split), and apparently she was laughed out of court. That last one, I'm not convinced of, my dad tends to over exaggerate things on occasion (tendency from just JustNo days I guess). She somehow blew the 20k while her kids walked around with shoes falling apart and not having money for the school bus. Plus not having a car. But I digress.


This is all relevant I swear.
So my dad has named me in charge of his estate on the occasion of his death. I organise everything, including funeral arrangements, life/funeral insurance etc... I'm also in charge of how all of his assets and $$ is split up between his kids. He has told me that if I want to give my brothers less money and give my sister and myself more, that's completely fine (my brothers are idiots and massive drug users, and he doesn't pretend not to know what they would do with that money). I, in a moment of weakness, disclosed some details of my dad's will to Hell Beast when it first was dumped on me. Details like... How much his funeral insurance payout and life insurance payout is. The fear of being in charge of all of that was overwhelming and I mistakenly confided in her.

She immediately started hinting about what I should do, not give my half brother anything, cheap funeral, sell X Y and Z etc... Got insulted when I mentioned about not giving my other brother much (he hates my dad and he himself belongs on Justnofamily).


So fast forward to now. I have always wondered why HB never divorced my dad. He secretly always loved her, so he never would initiate it, but I didn't understand Hell Beast. She would rant for hours and hours about how he ruined her and how her life would be so much better if she had never dated and married him etc..

And then when I recently joked to a friend (who works in divorce court and custody mediation), that my parents were nearing a milestone in their marriage, despite being split up for longer than they were together. She was instantly anxious, as we had spoken about my dad's will before as it still causes me to worry. She says ""they really need to get divorced... Like now. If your dad dies, it doesn't matter what his will says, your mum can take everything because legally they are still married."" And I tried to brush it off, but they (wide eyed and violently shaking their head at me) said ""no no no, I see this kinda stuff alot. He needs to divorce her, or else she will get everything. It doesn't matter if they have been separated for ages, legally she can"". It freaked me out, because I knew this was something HB would do.

I eventually called my dad and had an awkward conversation about how he should divorce HB. He agreed, and has looked into it, but nothing has happened as of yet.

And then I realised. Hell Beast constantly talks about how my dad won't last much longer, and that he doesn't take care of himself and he treats his body like shit (all true, he has genetic health issues that killed his father at 44, that he already has started to suffer from). My dad had a massive heart Attack at like 36 because he lived off lamingtons for 6 months straight (his words, not mine).

She has always known my dad is in bad health and is very self destructive. 

Some of you may have already realised by reading this, the connection I made about everything. Is Hell Beast trying to wait out my dad? Is that why she has never divorced him? She Knows (even before the will stuff came up) that he was worth a decent amount of money. She has even spoken about inheritance my dad is set to receive from an elderly close relative. 

Is she literally waiting for my dad to pass away, so she can swoop in and take everything? 

First off I was skeptical, but upon further thought. She always seems to just be waiting, she works, doesn't save money and just sort of seems like she's begrudgingly stuck and waiting for something to change. She could easily make her life simpler, but lives with her mother (which she hates). She's always tried to get as much money out of my dad as possible, always pocketed child support without taking care of her children's most basic needs and steals from her children.

I mentioned this theory to my SO. And he turned at me and without batting an eye said ""oh fuck yeah, I wouldn't doubt it for a second, she's a fucking leech"". So there's that.

I haven't mentioned this theory to my sister or fully laid it out to my dad (I'm hoping he will just divorce her, so I don't have to out anymore pressure on). 

But yes, Hell Beast trying to weasel money out of my dad by any means necessary. I'm not 100% convinced still, but I'm a solid 93% convinced. That 7% is the doubt that Hell Beast isn't smart enough to pull off something like this; but whether she's conniving enough, it's hard to know.

Thoughts?



Edit** thank you everyone for your legal advice. I appreciate it! I may not have been clear, but Hell Beast is not named in any insurance payouts or wills.
 Not concerned about her taking over my dad's funeral (as she couldn't care less about that stuff and she's lazy). My only concern is if it is truely her plan to contest the will, being his legal wife. I already have a good idea of the legalities involved (courtesy of my friend), and rest assured that my dad is organising divorce papers, but for reasons I can't disclose, is delayed.

Plus I have weapons to pimp slap HB out of the solar system if she tries to contest when that time comes."
94,"The Collector, Small BEC from the Book of Faces and MY PAAAAAARTY",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb2dd77b8>,throwawayunicorn1sie,0,3,30,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536014729.0,9cpzwz,"Hello all! So glad to not have had to come on here before the great big move to SO's country. During that time, I did have some small BEC to deal with from The Collector.

I had mentioned in a previous post (see bitchbot), that before my move, I was taking each of my family members out for lunch/dinner so I could have a little one-on-one time with them. I posted them on the book of faces and for my dad, The Collector liked, commented, and scolded SO for never treating her like how I treat my parents. Uhm, she returned an expensive designer bag SO and his brother got for her because she didn't like the color. After years of petty shit like that, why would SO bother? Then I did the same for my grandma, sister, and mom. One night I'm woken up to my phone blowing up to likes and comments. I look, and it was very obvious The Collector was on my page liking and commenting on everything, except, the one where I took my mom out for lunch (and damn, that lunch was so good, I can still taste the clam sauce). I asked SO if she has mentioned anything about taking her out, and he said he drove her to  go shopping so she would be quiet and not bitch about everything under the sun.

Then came the time for SO to come to my country to help me pack for the move. My god, it was a shitshow. The woman I was taking care of passed away 5 days before I was set to leave. I had previous dates where I was set to leave and she was on the brink of death but pulled through just as something had come up to delay my move, so her finally passing and being at peace was a true sign I was meant to do this. I had been busy coordinating the wake, taking care of her family, so I didn't have time to really pack. SO also wanted to treat me to a traditional date, so we took one night off, posted it on the book of faces and The Collector likes and comments with this horrifying meme. It's like a sarcastic ""yeaaaaaaaah"" smile. Not something you'd put on someone's page if you were happy for them and liked them. I asked SO and he showed me texts with her where she's trying to learn how  to communicate in GIFs and is absolutely failing hard. I didn't take it as her failing,  I took it as her being successful.

Then moving day came. SO explained to his parents that I will be very tired and need some time to adjust, so I would appreciate if I didn't see them for the first few days. They obliged, and on day 3, we went to see them. Things were nice, The Collector refuses to call my cat by her name or any of her million nick-names that I had given her. She then demanded we have a party for me as a welcome home shindig. Instantly I thought of the last two parties we had, where I did all the cooking and politely declined. She insisted, so I caved. I do like a lot of SO's extended family. Then she invited us over for dinner, which SO and I went to last night.

Dinner was great! My FFIL knew instantly to keep my wine glass full and he cooked my steak to my liking. I had good conversation with him. He let me practice speaking in their language, which was amazing. When The Collector heard me she said that I am to speak to her in my native language so she can learn. I asked to compromise and for her to speak in hers so  I can learn as well, and we can switch on and off, and she literally, I shit you not, stomped her foot and said no. SO lectured her and she huffed and puffed and agreed to it. Then came time for dinner, it was an awesome soup, great steak, and a salad. While she was setting up she asked if Cesar dressing was okay on the salad, and SO said no. She pestered, and he told her that on my top 10 things of food I hate, it's Cesar salad and the dressing. It makes my stomach churn. She then stomped around looking for something to put the dressing in for it to be on the table because it is rude to keep bottles on tables. One ingredient for the soup was really spicy and she warned me, but I have had it numerous times, and poured a lot of it into my soup, because it's damn delicious. She rolled her eyes and said I'm better at being their ethnicity than her own son is and she's a failure. I paid no mind because I had that bitching soup in front of me and the steaks waiting. I was talking with FFIL and tried to talk with The Collector about things. Like how I needed to get my nails done and if she knew the hours of the place we went to, so I could go. She demanded to take me and it had to only be VERY EARLY in the morning. She said the woman she goes to is now teaching classes, and they may benefit me so I can learn how to dye my hair better. Record scratch, I've been dying my hair for more than half of my life now, and I am pretty sure I have mastered it, and I have never been more in love with my hair. I said I'd love to go to the lessons to maybe learn a thing or two, pick up a part time job doing hair and nails, and then she retracted her statement because that job is too lowly to be acceptable in the family. I told her I'd be stopping out on my own to talk to the hairdresser about the lessons then if she couldn't support me.

Then came time to discuss the paaaaaaarty. SO and I have a vacation planned and we were trying to get a date for the paaaaaaarty for me. Each time a new date was given, she would change it to the exact weekend we were going to be away. After half an hour of back and forth a date was finally set, and I am looking forward to it. I also told her to please let me know if it is settled and to please let me know a time because I wanted to bake cookies. 

As always guys thanks for listening!"

It certainly showed just how deep in the FOG I still am, and how much work I have to do get myself mentally into a place where I can deal with my mother. 

I thought I might clarify to you just how the mess she's in came to be. To give you the full picture, we have to go back to the beginning. So this one is a bit of a blast from the past. 

My mother has always been categorically awful with money. You see, if you gave my mother 10 euroes for a week, she would make it last. 100€ for a week? Well, something needed to be fixed, might as well stock upon some staples, for those ten euro weeks. 1000€ for a week?? Well, there's something else that she has been wanting for a quite some while that now she can finally buy. She has never, to my knowledge, managed to save a single cent of any money she has come buy. If she has everything she needs, then she buys what she wants, even if she already has something similar to it.   

She has a bad back, and after multiple surgeries for prolapsed disks etc. (not a doctor, certainly don't speak medical English, so terminology might be off) she was pensioned off after many years of unemployment. As such, she has for decades lived on a very limited, fixed budget. She made it work, with grumbling and whining, but work nonetheless. Until my maternal grandmother died a few years ago. 

In her will, she left 50% of her estate to my mother, and 50% to my elder sister. I received nothing, but that is something I can expand upon a later post if you're interested. My grandmother had married, if not a rich man, then atleast a wealthy one. Once her husband died (not my paternal grandfather, that's another story that we might visit in a later post), she continued to live alone. She grew up during the WWII, so bitch was thrifty as hell, as you might imagine. Her estate was around 60k € on her bank account, plus a fancy 2 bedroom flat in a very choice part of town. Mind you, housing prices aren't completely crazy back home, so we are not talking about millions here. 

All in all, once all was settled and sorted, my mother received around 150k € after all the inheritance taxes, lawyers etc. were paid off. She was kind enough to lend me 15k € to supplement our savings for a downpayment for an apartment of our own. (Housing prices in Norway are cray-cray). She had 135k € left. Certainly a nice chunk of change, but not really a ""FUCK YOU"" kind of money, if you know what I mean?

She however certainly thought so. She went completely off the rails in her spending, buying gaudy jewelry (think 2-3 rings a finger, 3-4 golden chains with multiple pendants etc) which she would wear to buy fucking groceries. People with whom she had been perfectly neighbourly with she suddenly treated like trash. An example of this would be how she treated my best friend who had been kind of enough to help her with her computer occasionally. There was something wrong with the damn thing, and my friend offered to come and see it the next day after work. My mother went ballistic on him, screaming abuse, essentially saying that if he couldn't be bothered to help her right now, he might as well forget it, she could pay someone else to do it instead. I was mortified when he told me. It was as if my mother had been replaced with a particularly rude toddler. Even I, when not responding immediately to her demands, have felt a few of these lashes. 

The first Christmas after the inheritance was awful. She, perhaps out of guilt for the lean childhood years where ""Santa"" would only deliver a single package to me, bought a mountain of gifts for me and my DH, including a diamond ring for 2k € and other assorted jewelry. I hated most of the things. As per usual, she had bought things she liked, as opposed to things I might have wanted.

 I had hoped she would spend the money wisely, perhaps buy a small flat for herself in a less trendy part of town or perhaps in a nearby smaller communities, where 60k-80k gets a perfectly fine flat with 1-2 bedrooms in a very good standard. Each gift that I opened, my face would grow more and more wooden when instead of the joy of receiving I felt the mounting disappointment and sadness. She could read my emotions on my face, and ended up crying and making a huge scene out of the fact that I didn't like my presents, how ungrateful I was, Oh! the woe is her! etc. Yet another Christmas ruined, as is the family tradition.  

She never bought anything ""real"" with that money. Just spent it on unnecessary, vulgar trash. And it is all gone now, not a single cent is left. All the jewelry she bought? She has pawned it, for a fraction of the value. She is still living in a rental flat that is way too big and expensive for her. We have offered to help her move to a more affordable location, but she has refused our aid in looking for a new place. 

 I did get my own little revenge though, in a way. When she first started to whine about how broke she was, how she owed so much money, I picked every single piece of gold jewelry she had ever given me, and gave them to her next time I visited her. I told her we would drive together to the pawnshop where she would deposit them. Pawnshops around home don't really pay for ""design"" or a brand name, instead you get paid for the weight in gold and maaaaybe if the stones are particularly rare or fanciful, for those as well. I asked to see the receipts. She got 4k € out of my ""golden hoard"".  

She knows I had other assets beyond my jewelry box, and I could have given her the amount in cash. By returning all her gifts except one pair of earrings (family heirloom) I at least got to twist the knife a little bit in return for her awfulness. Fair enough, it was hella expansive twist, but in all fairness, a lot of the stuff was just fucking tacky and I never wore them. 

This became rather long, but thank you for reading. This is cheaper than therapy. If any of you come up with a nice name for her, I'm taking suggestions.

**Background**


I've always been a very private person. So private, that if I wasn't anonymous on Reddit, I never would have written any of my stories. Ever. I *(still)* also keep all but the most trusted people at arm's length. Part of the reason is because of being ashamed of the abuse I suffered. Part of it was because DM and others used everything and everyone to hurt me. They can't use what they don't know. 


In the summer of 1980, I was all of 14 years old and staying with GrannyB and Papa. I was extremely withdrawn. To the point of only saying: “Yes.” “No.” “Fine.” and refusing to see any family. Well, my grandparents put up with this for 2 weeks. Then one day over breakfast, Papa told me I needed to get out of my own head. He told me that everyday I was required to do 1 random act of kindness or good deed. I wasn't to tell him or anyone what I did *(no selfless act is selfless if you receive recognition for it)* but I was required to tell him that I did it. 


That summer I learned to **SEE** that other people struggled too and a little kindness goes a long ways. 




**Fast Forward**


The year was 1989, my oldest son was 3 years old and adorable. Very sweet and kind hearted. I had been teaching him things like smiling at someone who's frowning, saying “Have a happy day” to people he comes across, and, of course, doing Random acts of kindness or a good deed. He liked doing it. It just takes time and patience for me to let him. 


One Saturday, Despicable Maw picked up OS early. She had a busy day planned and wanted to take OS to her friends. *(Read: Show off)*. Ok. Fine. Have fun.


Later that afternoon, she shows up 4 hours earlier than planned and hopping pissed. DM slams into my house dragging a crying OS by his arm and yelling. 


>DM *(red faced and loud)*: “I just can't do this anymore! It's ridiculous! I can't take him Anywhere! It's all drama with him!”


I pick up my son, start rocking him and tell him “It's ok.” I'm also getting offended and protective with each word out of her mouth. I asked her what happened.


>DM *(puffed up)*: “Him! That's what happened! I couldn't go anywhere without him talking to some old bat, playing with some crying baby or helping someone load their fucking car! It was ridiculous!”


*(Now normally I would send my son into his room so he doesn't see Mommy yelling at Grandma, but my son needed to here this)*


>Me *(indignant, flabbergasted)*: “DM! Do you even hear yourself?!?! Your mad at OS for being kind and caring?!?! Perhaps you could learn a thing or two from him! **YOU** are the one being ridiculous not OS! You need to leave now. Don't come back until you've grown a heart!”


She sputtered and yelled but she finally left.


That afternoon and night my sweet little boy with his big blue eyes cried and held on tight to me, kept saying over and over” *“Promish I won heped no mo pespols! I don wan Grasma to be mad no mo.”* Nothing I said helped. It broke my heart. 


For 2 weeks, OS did everything he could to not help people or be extra kind. No playing with babies. No helping people with doors or bags. No extra smiles. I cried over it. So did he. 


I hung up on Despicable Maw anytime she called and refused to open the door when She came by. I just couldn't with her. 


Finally, I called in the Calvary and OS’s favorite people: GrannyB and Papa. I didn't know what else to do but I did know that if they couldn't fix it, it wasn't going to get fixed. Thankfully, they agreed to come. 


They arrived the next Saturday, bright and early. OS was thrilled to be with them. He acted like his normal self. We sat around and talked for a bit, then Papa told me my mother was coming over in a bit. While my eyes narrowed, OS’s eyes filled with tears. His lips started quivering and he ran outside. Papa immediately went after him. GrannyB held onto my hand, assured me that everything would be alright and then went outside too. 


They were out there forever. Just walking the fields and talking. I was inside praying and pacing. 


Despicable Maw showed up while they were outside. I let her in but refused to acknowledge or speak to her except once. She said she was going outside. I told her that she messed OS up enough and that if she did interrupt them, it would be the last time she ever saw my son again. I guess she decided that I meant it because she stayed put.


Finally! They came in. Papa first, then GrannyB with OS falling in behind chattering like a magpie. Then OS saw Despicable Maw. He immediately stopped talking and looked at her learily. Then hid behind Papa.


>DM *(with open arms)*: “OS, come to Grandma! Aren't you happy to see me?! Why aren't you coming to Grandma?”


I start to say something but GrannyB shot me a look. 


>Papa *(picks up OS and says sternly)*: “DM, you know that you scared OS the last time you saw him and hurt his feelings. Don't you have something to say to him?”


Despicable Maw made a fake assed apology which GrannyB, Papa and I all saw through but satisfied OS. OS gave her a quick hug but immediately went back to Papa. They all left a while later. Though GrannyB and Papa did visit the next day for the whole day. Thrilled OS and I both. 


Despicable Maw called after they went back home and asked me when She could have OS again. I informed her that I wasn't fooled by her apology and I didn't trust her not to do it again. She would have to prove herself. I knew just how right I was when She got mad. 


When she called GrannyB and Papa to get them to talk to me, it really upset her when they put her in her place and agreed with me. Papa said he gave her “a good talking to”. LOL 


It took until my youngest son was born before she was allowed to be alone with him. 


OS did happily go back to doing Random acts of kindness and good deeds again. 


Sadly, he never again did an act of kindness or a good deed in front of Despicable Maw again. She never got that trust back. 


At 32yo, he remembers that incident. It still hurts him. It still breaks my heart that it does.

97,Just realizing I have any fog to work through,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb2c54b70>,justnothrow465773,0,16,12,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536027749.0,9crl29,"Long time lurker, though I comment with a non-throwaway account from time to time. Just don't want to use a username that's linked to other things. Anyway, I have no SO, so therefore no MIL, but my mother is... something else. 

&#x200B;

After a long-ass time, I got back into contact with a very good friend of mine, and our conversation about our home lives, and hearing how she saw things in my home... it's been unnervingly eye opening. I'm a bit at a loss. I probably have some FOG to work through - no, I know I do.

&#x200B;

I'm discovering that my mother is... neurotic. About me, too. She's not neurotic over my brothers, as far as I can tell, but we'll see now that my eyes are opened more. I'm 31 now, and if I go somewhere to meet a new friend in a very public place, with an escape route planned if necessary, she will ask who I am meeting, where am I going, do I know for sure if they're not a criminal, among other questions that elude me at the moment. So I am learning that from now on, I should just keep my mouth shut, because she will pry and pry even as I feel increasingly uncomfortable with her questions and evident lack of trust. I've always prided myself in being particularly logical, so somehow not even seeing all of this is... it's an embarrassment.

&#x200B;

She's babied me for most of my life, especially in my formative years. When I'd refuse to do homework, she would essentially do it for me when I'd rather just take the F on it. When I refused to eat, uncertain why looking at food made me so uneasy and not wanting to, she would tell me this sad story she made up about a girl in India who ate one part of a lettuce leaf and said that she was full for a week. She then died. She would then ask me if I wanted to die like that poor girl. And if I didn't want to die, then I'd better eat. I was 8-9 years old. By the way, it didn't help.

&#x200B;

Even now, I'm embarrassed to say that I've never been able to hold a steady job, I'm still anxious around new people and new environments, and I'm terrified of making an ass of myself. I'm also terrified of calling people I don't know for these same reasons, as it can take me up to an hour to psyche myself up to give someone a call, for, say appointments. For the most part, I feel incredibly stupid and out of place whenever I try, because I fear that I'll be laughed at or I'll do something wrong, so... I've been letting my mother call places for me. I still live with my mother because my father is... worse. In ways. But this is just no mil.

&#x200B;

The food issue happened a second time when I would lock myself in my room at the age of 19 and would refuse to eat while my mom's abusive boyfriend would come by - I don't know what I felt, exactly, but nothing comfortable. By the way, she invited him to live with us while she was divorcing my father and we were instructed to treat him - my memory says ""like a father"". Sort of. At least we didn't have to call him dad. Anyway, she came into my room after weeks of me avoiding her boyfriend (and rarely eating in the process,) and I'll never forget what she said: ""If you don't eat, I will take you to the hospital, and the doctor will shove a tube down your throat and *make you* eat.""

&#x200B;

She later also threatened to throw me out of the house when I admitted that I was in an online relationship with another woman, unless I broke up with her. She only found out because I couldn't find a place to safely hide the flowers my then girlfriend gave me without rapidly killing them from lack of sunlight. I'm not sure how I feel about surprise gifts these days.

&#x200B;

In later years, I was around 24 or 25 when one time, she brought a friend over and talked about me to her with me in the room, asking her if she thought that I was too skinny and should eat more. She spoke about me as if I wasn't 3 feet away from her and looking at her. I was instructed to play with the woman's daughter and let her interact with my stuff. I draw for fun, and this kid started abusing my supplies (some of them not cheap) and other BEC things and in hindsight, I probably felt rather infantilized over having to babysit a kid for free instead of my grown ass self being able to talk with them and not look after a kid that was not my responsibility.

&#x200B;

It took until I was in my early twenties to be diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and possibly depression. Over what? Food. I would get so anxious over it that I would feel like I was going to vomit if I swallowed it. The gut feelings I had were wrong, of course, but it made trying to eat a hellish experience. I had to subsist on energy shakes when solid food wasn't working, and it took nothing short of visiting my grandparents and her help and love more than once to help me recover. Even now, whenever I try to wean myself off of my medicine, I only last a week before I go back to needing it again in order to not fear food. I wish I didn't need this medicine, but I'm grateful that it helps me so much.

&#x200B;

So, my physical health is... better. I weigh more than I ever have and I can eat comfortably, and I get less anxiety over trying new things, but I rarely sleep well. Just, hearing some things that I haven't mentioned yet has resulted in me just having trouble with things - that maybe my childhood is worse than I really remember it being - and am hopeful for a listening ear here. Sorry that this is all over the place. I know how warm and welcoming this is place but there's some fear in me still that I'll be laughed at.

&#x200B;

Does anyone have any methods you use to combat anxiety? (I am on two medications, one is for emergencies.) I know repeated exposure helps me sometimes, but I don't know how to do that with phone problems. I just... I'm 31 years old and I have no idea how to stand up on my own, and it sucks. "
98,SMIL: an Introduction and a Rant,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb2c8fc50>,glittergirl_125,0,12,27,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536010434.0,9cpgdx,"Hi everyone, first time poster. I normally just sympathize from afar with all the bitch eating crackers nonsense my step-MIL and JNFIL pull, but today I'm just TIRED. Keep in mind I'm 4 months postpartum and super overwhelmed. (Going to hopefully see a doctor about PPD when my new insurance kicks in.)

I feel bad posting because this is so minor but I really don't have anyone to talk to about it. 

Yesterday I posted what I thought was a funny meme on my DH's facebook page. It was a dad putting a little kid in a shopping cart car saying ""Now you can drive like daddy!"" and then the kid immediately starts play cussing out other drivers. DH thought it was pretty funny because he has notoriously bad road rage. He doesn't drive dangerously, he just shit talks other drivers. He knows I'm not a fan.

So cute meme, what's the problem? His step-mother. This woman. She and FIL have both been in prison (SMIL is even the one who put him there!). I've also heard some stories about some of the things she's done (I don't want to go into detail but we're talking potential abuse of her daughters that she either knew about/actively participated in). Neither one has ever held a real job. She's morbidly obese and SUPER opinionated about everything. Even after putting FIL in jail they got back together after their respective sentences were over. I like to think bonding over their mutual hatred of me is what glues their dumpster fire of a train wreck relationship together. 

And they do, they hate my guts. FIL because I took my DH (his willing slave) away from him and SMIL because, I'm not sure exactly? Hatred by association? Possibly because I refuse to let my children be anywhere near either without direct supervision from me or DH. They've always done anything they could to undermine our relationship. If there's ever a car they don't recognize in the drive, I'm cheating. They see me leave for an appointment looking ""dressed up"" as they put it, I'm cheating. After my son was born they told everyone he wasn't my DH's. That backfired on them though because my son came out looking like my husband gave birth to him with no help from me at all. Now with my daughter they started the same crap. Even showed up at the hospital and SMIL was snarking about how ""it only makes sense a girl wouldn't look like their dad, she looks nothing like DH"". I got revenge for that though, when about 2 months later at the 4th of July party my DH's aunt threw everyone lost their minds about how much she looked like him. To the extent of joking about how they didn't know he would be such an attractive girl. SMIL sat with cat butt face all night and refused to talk to anyone but her own daughter. 

They've done more, but there literally just isn't the time to go through all of it, and its not really the big things that get me, its the little ""death by a thousand paper cuts"" things. She's always got something shitty to say about me. Snarky comments, tearing me down brick by brick. While I was in nursing school I was drowning, trying to juggle my home life with a toddler and a very competitive program (over half usually get cut), and they would hint that I needed to get a job and would send DH home with job ideas for me. She's always done this crap and the most frustrating part is my DH is oblivious, acts like I'm crazy, maybe I am.

Today though, cute meme. DH and several other people like it. Then-  SMIL: ""That sounds more like what the Mom would be saying LOL""

Guys, I was just done. I admittedly got annoyed with DH. I told him it would be nice if he actually said something. If he could actually defend me for once. So he replied (and this is bittersweet because I had to ask him to, if that makes sense): ""thats straight up me (Son) even yells at me for it"".

I thought she would drop it, DH has never called her on any of her nonsense towards me. I thought I might get to win one round. No, she came back with: ""But the wife usually does the same because of all the crazy drivers out there.""

First of all we've been together for over 12 years! Don't act like you don't know my name, ""the wife"". Second of all I don't road rage, I get annoyed with DH over it. Don't act like you know me.

I know this is so stupid and inconsequential. I think I'm mostly frustrated that she doubled down on it. Like despite all of the evidence to the contrary DH can't have a bad trait, obviously glitter is the one with the problem. If anyone teaches the kids something bad its glitter. Glitter is a huge piece of shit, etc... 

I'm just so tired of being shit on constantly and DH not seeing it. I'm tired of them always winning. Which is why I'm here. I know for a fact that some of you ladies are literal queens of snark. Do any of you have any ideas for something to comment that would burn her up with out making me look like a dramatic cry baby? I'm too emotional right now to really defend myself and I don't have anyone else. Thank you."
