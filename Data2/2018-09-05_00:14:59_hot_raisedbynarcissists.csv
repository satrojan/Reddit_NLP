0,Do you care about this community? Would you like to help us keep it going? Apply to be a mod!,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfae9b0a20>,RBNmod,0,59,490,False,raisedbynarcissists,Do not PM shared account.

Have you been an active user for a year or so, and would like to help make this sub a better place? We have an opportunity for you! We are looking for some people who would like to be trained to be an RBN mod.  Specifically, we are looking for people who care deeply about this community and the support that it offers and would like to help the team develop it and keep it safe.  We are not looking for folks who just want another badge. 

You can spend as much time as you like helping keep this community safe for abuse survivors.  If you have 20 minutes a day, that's a huge help!  If you have 2 hours a day, that's great, too!  It's all up to you!

As this is a huge subreddit, we understand that jumping right in can be stressful. That is why we are looking for people who would like to (start out or) be mini-mods. What’s a mini-mod, you may ask? Well, we are looking for mini-mods to do one or both of the following:

**Flair Control** - As a flair mod, your sole responsibility would be to go through our unmodded links, and confirm or apply the proper flairs according to guidelines. We have automoderator tag according to key words, but as it’s a robot that can’t understand context, it’s not always right. Many people do not apply flairs or do not know how to apply flairs as well (which is absolutely fine!) as this mod would help with that.

**Auto-Mod Queue** - as a queue mod, you would go through our queue and deal with only the items reported by our automoderator. The automoderator will report items based on key words, to confirm context or to alert us to possible drama or someone who needs extra support. As far as user reports go, you will not be responsible for this, as we will handle this.

Mini-mods are not given full mod permissions immediately, as with most jobs there is a probationary period to ensure that the new team member is an appropriate fit for the sub (acts appropriately, follows the mod rules/guidelines, etc.). Generally training takes one to two months for mini-mods but that depends on the individual, the time they can commit to the volunteer position, how much material is covered and how the senior mods feel about the trainee's progress.

If you'd like to be promoted to a full-mod eventually, that is something you can work towards.  If you would like to stay a mini-mod, that is just fine, too!  It's up to you.  

However, there is one bit that is no longer optional.  **Availability on Discord for text chat only (never video) is required.**  It doesn't mean that you must be on Discord all day or that you must answer any message to you on Discord instantly.  It just means that you should be able to check in with Discord periodically (at least a few times a week) to get updates from the other mods about what is going on and for training assignments, etc.  

I also want to be honest about what this job entails.  It is reading a lot of triggering content.  It is seeing the truly dark side of RBN that our general members never get to see, because we try to remove all that B.S. before our members have to read that nonsense.  It can take an emotional toll, but it is also rewarding.  The thank you notes that we occasionally get from members are nice.  The posts that thank the mods because the group saved their life... those are nice, too.  

If modding sounds like a good job for you, fill out the form linked below and it will be reviewed ASAP! Successful applicants will be contacted by a mod of /r/raisedbynarcissists some time in the future (sorry, no time line available at this point).

2,[RANT] NMom and NSis showed up to my home after I went NC with them,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb2783630>,sexyhappyunicorn,0,129,1466,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536075650.0,9cwre1,"Yesterday I hosted the family Labor Day celebration at my home. 


Usually it’s at my parent’s house but my NMom and Dad are separated so no one wanted to go to their house. My NMom and NSis live there and my Dad is staying with me until their divorce is finalized.


For the first time in a long time all of my local family showed up. Most of them refuse to come to family events (except funerals) because they don’t want to deal with my NMom. 



We were having a great time. Everything was stress free. 



Then my NMom and NSis walk in the gate to my backyard. My heart sank immediately.



Everyone goes silent. A few of my relatives run inside the house because they didn’t want to deal with her or NSis. My Aunt who records all family events turns the camera to them.



My NMom yells at me about how inconsiderate it was to exclude them, how much I must really hate her and my NSis, how jealous of them I am,  how she hates coming to my house because it’s always so “sterile” and she’s afraid to touch anything or sit anywhere. 



I cut her off at that point and tell her neither of them are welcome and they need to go before I call the police (my Dad has a restraining order against my NMom). They head to the gate but not before she had to get the final word. 



**She tells me she read the e-mail I sent to her about cutting off all contact. She says “I’m offended by you and how you say I’ve treated you. All I’ve ever done is try to love you and you’re unlovable. How is that my fault? He’s (she pointed to my Dad) unlovable too. My online therapist says you’re both social rapists and terrible people!”**



I shrugged my shoulders and responded “of course we are. Nothing is ever your fault. I abused myself all those years. And if you truly feel that way about us then leave and never come back here. I don’t want you to feel socially raped.”



**Her response was “I had to come since you changed all your phone numbers, I can’t reach you at work, your Dad got that restraining order on me and any e-mails I send to you come back with a message that you’re not taking my e-mails and not to contact you. I knew you’d be here so I came to tell you and him (she pointed at my Dad) I’m done with you both. If you two don’t want me to contact you anymore then I won’t. Let’s see how good your life is without me. You’re not welcome at my house ever again. I don’t need either of you.”**



I tell her “I’m good with that. Have a nice life.”



When they’re almost at the car my NSis comes back and yells to my Dad “you’ll never see your grandkids again.” My father points to my NSis’ ex-husband who says “they’re here with me. They’re inside the house playing video games. He’ll see them plenty.”



My NSis kicks over 2 of my potted cactus plants, gets scratched by the needles then tripped by the first pot she kicked over. She gets up then runs to the car crying.



We all  try not to laugh since it was so comically dramatic but it was very hard not to so we laughed.




I hope I don’t see or hear from either of them anytime soon. I still feel good about going NC with both of them. Best decision I’ve made ever. 



**Thanks to everyone on here who sent me encouraging PMs after going NC with them. The positive support has been overwhelmingly awesome. There’s comfort knowing that I’m not alone and I can help others not feel so alone since we’re all going through the same things.**"
3,My Nparents resent me for being a successful and functioning adult,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb5fffe48>,LittleSeries,0,36,237,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536080557.0,9cxkc2,"My family was very poor growing up. My Nfather is 55 and is a high school drop out. My Nmother is 59 and dropped out of college and hasn't had a job since the late 70's. Throughout my life they pushed me to go to college and get a degree because they said it was the key to success, but they really had no idea what any of it meant. Their highest aspirations for me were for me to go to community college maybe.

So basically I had 0 guidance in life on where to go. My parents were no help, they have no idea how the world works and make no effort to learn. I went through school and got a degree in CS. My first job was working help desk for $6 dollars an hour (I'm 34 so this was in the mid 2000's). I made less with a college a degree than without one stacking boxes at a grocery store.

But I fought and was driven to climb the corporate ladder. I self taught myself countless things, gained experienced, and then moved from job to job to gain more money. It took me 7 companies and well over a decade, but I finally became successful. I worked my ass off and now I make 6 figures working in my living room in a city I used to vacation in. I'm happily married to my wonderful wife and we have a great life 5 states away from the city I grew up in.

My parents should be proud of me right? Wrong. They call my wife and I ""snobs"". They guilt trip me for moving away all the time (they want me to live in their shit hole neighborhood with them). They give us backhanded remarks in a condescending tone like ""you're so fancy"" and ""you're riccchhhhh"". They don't even know what I do for a living or what my company's name is called. When they visit me they tell me ""I live in a bubble"" and other bizarre shit. I even caught my Nmother talking shit about me to my aunt because she accidentally dialed my number and left the disturbing shit on my voicemail.

Worst of all is that talk about my brother's job and how great he is constantly. He's 30 and lives at home and he's a janitor. They go on and on about how good his job is and how successful he is. They do this because they can control him because and thus he's the ""golden child"". Never mind the fact that he put a gun to my father's face and said he was going to kill him. They didn't press charges of course. After all this he is held in a higher regard than myself while they resent me for not being in their stable to mental illness.

They can resent me all they want, the best revenge is a life well lived."
4,Mentally Changing My nDad's Name in my Head is Giving Me a Newfound Boundary and Freedom.,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb5b2ff98>,AnonymousZi,0,90,547,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536060421.0,9cuqj7,"TL;DR : Addressing my nFather by his name has really helped sever the already frayed emotional ties I have to the man. Now Jim is just the guy that Mom and I take care of. 

I'm currently reading the story of Regina Calcaterra and the severely harsh upbringing she endured with her sisters and brother. In the book, ""Etched in Sand"" (and her sister Rosie's book, ""Girl Unbroken""), they called their mother ""Cookie"" because she was their mother in blood, but not in any other sense of the term. 

Now, I'd never say my upbringing was anywhere close to what those siblings went through, and I feel guilt even adapting this emotional tool from them, but in the passed two days I've mentally changed the way I think of my father from ""Dad"" to ""Jim"" has actually worked wonders. 

No more rabbit-hole thinking for me of, ""Dad's mad, what did I do? I just got home, I thought I did everything right today, why is he taking it out on me? Why is it always like this? Why does he hate me so much? My chest is tightening already - I hop he doesn't pick up on that, then he'll really go off."" 

Now it's just, ""Jim's silently fuming at us? That's just Jim for you. Jim's got issues that I can't help or fix. Whatever. I have some laundry to fold."" 

Has anyone else adapted this? "
5,Love Bombing HURTS,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb4a605f8>,flare_of_light,0,20,342,False,raisedbynarcissists,Support,1536066938.0,9cvhxs,"So... my parents have been texting me recently. At first I got all excited because of course I love them and when dad text me to share an annecdote about his life I felt really happy and I missed them both and wanted to feel closer to them. 

But... when they do this, it usually means they either have bad news about someone I love or they've just given my sibling a massive present and they're messaging me to try and either let me know so I'll be hurt or maybe just to assuage their subconscious guilt. 

Anyway, following day I get mega love bombed, fished for information (they're on a pretty severe information diet) and get my spouse casually insulted by mum. Then I find out they've just bought my sibling (who they've been bank rolling at about $60,000 a year to study and not work - she's in her 30's and this is her third different qualification) a holiday to the west coast of America with her best friend because she got good grades. 

So I got proved right. Then I cried because I was right. 

Then I gaslit myself for the next three days that I'm being irrational and somehow this is all something wrong with my perception of the situation and that they're great. Thats still going on. I guess I still just want to be loved so much. Ugh.

Since I went v low contact I stopped getting cystic acne, stomach ulcers, depression & dissociative episodes. So clinging onto my improvement in health as evidence I'm not crazy and I'm doing the right thing by keeping the boundaries and the VLC rock solid. "
6,"Nparents tried to villainize me to a friend's sibling, but they couldn’t keep from acting crazy and awful long enough for it to work.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb5ea2be0>,incasethisgetsugly,0,7,139,False,raisedbynarcissists,Mommy’s little villain ,1536077680.0,9cx3f1,"Several months ago a friend’s brother ended up doing some maintenance work at my Nparents’ house. I’m NC, and have been for over a year. The first day they did a number on him saying that they were just so hurt that I wouldn’t return their calls and that they bought me some expensive gift and they just wanted to talk to me. Friend gets a call from her brother that night about how maybe I had gone too far and that friend needs to reach out to me on their behalf. She says no, and that I have my reasons end of conversation. Her brother goes back to their house the next day, and apparently thinking that he’s now on their side, they spend the entire day ranting about how I’m an “ungrateful fucking bitch” and just really letting all of their crazy awful behavior hang out. 
He called my friend at the end of that day to say that she had been right and that they’re nuts. 

Now, of course this is all secondhand from my friend, but it matches their behavior exactly. She said, “I didn’t want to tell you because I thought it would be upsetting hearing about them saying that stuff about you” and my response was “That sounds exactly like them”.
I’m just so glad that someone else got to see it. "
7,Got fooled into thinking I could savor a few last memories with my Nmom. I just told her to go fuck herself for the last time and I won't even visit her when she's on her deathbed (she'd still be playing the victim anyway),<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb3616048>,arcanine911,0,12,113,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536078049.0,9cx5ho,"When my dad died a year ago, I tried to reconnect with my Nmom.  Fucking stupid, I know.  I've long accepted that she would never change and I wasn't trying to change her.  For some bizarre reason, I thought I could create some last happy memories with her as I was on the verge of becoming one of those people who loses both their parents when I'm only in my 20's.

I have this flaw where I try to see the good in people, and I have no idea where I developed this characteristic.  Maybe it was from the negative environment I grew up in?  Because of this I've been taken advantage of numerous times, and I'm telling you all now that I am DONE falling for this shit.  Some people are just plain fucking evil.

There were signs over the past year that she was hiding some shit, but I chose to ignore them as I didn't live there anymore and honestly, I didn't WANT to believe them.  She sold my brother's bike and pawned my grandmother's ring.  She and my enabling sister went to the social security office the day after my dad died to try siphoning money, and then had a wake for him without ever inviting me.

I knew it was money.  But I chose to ignore it and accept her vices.

Every Saturday she would call me and ask to hang out and we would; sometimes it would just be lunch and dinner, or sometimes we would take walks in the park and talk.  Sometimes she would laugh and actually listen to my stories and I knew deep down they were fake because all she wanted to know was if my brother had deposited money into my account to give to her.  If my brother HAD deposited money, she would hang out with me longer.  Otherwise, she would find excuses to leave such as claiming she was tired or had a dinner with a friend to attend.

Anyway, I should mention the most important part of all of this: my cousin ""John"".  John moved up here from SoCal over a year and a half ago to attend UC Berkeley and somehow he ended up living with my mom.  I do not know if he asked her to stay here or if it was the other way around.  

My mom and sister (yes, we talked again for a few weeks before I blocked her number completely because she was still a compulsive lying junkie) would constantly bitch to me about how lazy John was, how he refused to pay rent and get a part-time job, and how he would sleep in until noon on his days off.  As I said, I didn't fucking care as I didn't live there anymore.

But shit started affecting me as my mom would leave messages for me whining about how she needed groceries and had no food and other shit.  Since I wasn't giving money to her directly, it didn't bother me the first few times I drove across the city after an 8 hour fucking work shift just to deliver some water and random produce.  Finally I asked my mom why the fuck she wouldn't ask John to just walk across the street to help buy them shit and did she know how ridiculous it was that she was asking me to do this shit?  My mom isn't exactly disabled herself either.  We all live in a VERY large city where there are grocery stores and liquor stores mottled across every other block.  

My moms excuse was that it would be rude to ask John and that he was graduating in another year and to just tolerate it.

My brother and I have gotten along in life more than anyone else in the family and he told me he had a theory that my mom and sister was lying about John's antics.  She had done the **exact same thing** to me and my siblings to other people, all for the purpose of free money.  I decided to test out his theory.

I sent a text to John and asked if he could ""please try helping out more with groceries"" -- never once did I act accusatory or ask suspicious questions.  He immediately called me and said there was A LOT of misinformation about everything and he wanted to come clean about it.

1) On the second day he had moved in, my sister had told John to pretend he wasn't paying rent so that my brother and I wouldn't stop supporting my mom financially.  She told him not to trust anything I said and that I was ""crazy"".

2) John HAD been paying rent since the day he moved in.  He sent me picture messages of all the bank transactions linking the transfers directly to my mother's name.  

3) John also sent me picture messages of the texts my sister had sent him warning him not to speak to me, of her asking him for money, and bragging about how much ""she was ballin"".  These were antics my sister were well known for, so there was no way he could have just photoshopped them.

4) John had concerns about how my mom runs out of money quickly every month.  Apparently she was still disappearing for days at the casinos.  Additionally, John WAS bringing groceries him and taking my mom out to eat every other day; he had photos of them at restaurants with that fakeass witch smiling as I could see she was taking advantage of my own cousin..  All of this contradicted my moms whiny stories about how John never helped her ass out.

There was so much proof and information provided to me that I made *the final decision*: I was going to confront my mother and depending on how she reacted, I would cut her out of my life entirely.  Forever.

She picked up the phone and claimed she had told me everything John stated above and immediately became aggressive until finally telling me to ""just go kill myself"".  Yep, that was the proof I needed - my mother always acted like the victim when she was caught lying and playing people.  

I immediately called AT&T and cut off the cell phone bill I had been paying for her.  With all the money she's obtained from lying and stealing, I'm quite sure she's more than capable of paying her own bill.

I cancelled her name on the trip to NYC we were planning to take together later this month and instead worked it out with my husband to have him come instead.  NYC has always been my dream city to visit and I would rather go with the love of my life than a lying piece of shit.  The fees were nothing compared to saving my mental health.

Anyway, sorry for the long post but I wanted to let you all know that I have been much happier the past few days knowing I will never be in contact with this woman again.  Btw, on the same day I confronted her, she claimed she was having side pains and needed to go to the ER.  Magically, she called me from her house phone a few hours after I had disconnected her cell phone to try leaving me an angry voice message that I didn't even bother listening to.

We are all stronger than we think, and sadly sometimes we need we need a reminder to push ourselves to best capabilities but I am glad more than anything that I never gave up."
8,I can't believe nmom sold it...,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb756bfd0>,lucid_shad0w,0,37,139,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536072943.0,9cwcjs,"...Wait, yes I can, but I'm still mad.

When I was a kid, I was super into collecting Breyer horses (realistic model horses).  Knowing this, my grandfather offer to build me a custom barn to house them in.  He did an amazing job and presented it to me at Christmas.  It was awesome and got a ton of use.

Fast forward: As I'm moving out at 22, I took my Breyer horses with me but left the barn as it was large and my apartment was small.  Nmom at the time was storing all of my old toys in hopes that a grandchild would be able to play with them.  Nparents had a basement and even when I bought my first house it was in North Carolina and had no basement.  Believing that nmom was keeping all of my old toys, I didn't think much of it.

Fast forward some more: We move back up to Ohio so my daughter can be closer to all of her family.  Nmom start slowly giving out my old toys to her (of course, it's a little bit at a time as an ""excuse"" to see my daughter).  Last night, nmom gives my daughter all of the Breyer horse accessories then casually mentions that she had gotten rid of the barn because it was too big.  I sat that flabbergasted because that literally was the only thing I cared about, and she didn't keep it (i.e. she sold it, and pocketed the money).  


I'm still upset today.  I know it's just a thing, but it was the nicest thing my grandfather every gave me (he died in early 2013) and I was looking forward to seeing my daughter play with it.  If she would have said something that she didn't want to store it anymore, I would have gladly taken it off of her hands.  Rather, I'm assuming that she just wanted the money.  If I would have known this was going to happen, It would have been the first thing I'd have taken with me when I first moved out.  The hubby convinced me to email her about it, since it's apparently upsetting me this much.  We'll see how that goes...

Watching this show has opened my eyes up to a lot of things about myself I hadn't realized, and actually made me think about people differently.

When someone gets irritated with me, I instantly become so apologetic that it can be pathetic.

I’m a long-time lurker, first time poster. I’m 17, moved out of my mom’s house about five months ago, and have been living with my dad. I left really suddenly because I was afraid of things escalating to physical violence, and I haven’t been in contact with her since (except for once, when she claimed I was making everything up, and told me I was even lying about being scared of her) . Until today, when she showed up at my school on the first day of the new school year, and demanded we go somewhere to talk.

I said no, to which she replied that she’d keep coming to my school every day during lunch and sitting next to me the whole time. Apparently she wants us to go out to lunch together once a week so she can show me pictures of from my childhood and talk about what I was like as a kid, covering a year each time we meet. I don’t know why she wants to do this, but the last thing I want is to be alone with her, even if it’s just in a car. I’d also strongly prefer she not show up at my school for an hour every day, though. I can’t do anything legally, because my parents still technically have shared custody, and my dad doesn’t want any sort of legal battle. She’s also charming, so the school staff doesn’t have a problem with her being there, and they don’t know what she’s saying to me most of the time as she talks to me in a second language we both speak. Unfortunately, my school is also pretty small, so physically hiding would be hard.

Is there something I could do to make her get bored/just wear herself out and leave? If not, what’s my best bet as to dealing with this?"

It's the most hopeful, joyous feeling I've had in a long time. I'm trying to just keep things simple and as peaceful as possible in these last few days because when my N knows I'm doing well, she has to take me down a few pegs, and honestly I'm just so tired of dealing with that. 

Anyway, last night's dinner as disgusting as it was made me happy because this is one of the last times I'll ever have to eat meat that I know was questionably prepared. My N gets physically aggressive with me, so I have to eat what she prepares or face getting hit or having something like a knife drawn on me. You know, the usual. 

Dinner was just a pile of chicken. Literally only chicken. She only ever wants to cook a single item when she cooks, because she loves to put in minimal effort and then go on like a martyr for it. 

Normally, I cook so I have at least some control over what I eat, but she likes to cook at least once a week. 

There's a story about this chicken, because my N is an idiot and lazy. Great combo in the kitchen, right? So, we bought the chicken like four or five months ago. She let it sit in the fridge for five days before deciding that yes, we should freeze it, because we can never take my suggestions right away. So, this chicken ended up getting freezer burned. She takes it out last week and decides to thaw it in the windowsill because ""the air will move around it and thaw it very well because of physics"", and yes that's a direct quote. Then, the chicken sits in the fridge for another five or so days before she decides it's ready to cook. 

So, that was the dinner I was forced to choke down. I have horrid stomach cramps and other symptoms of food poisoning, but I've gotten used to living this way. I've gotten used to this. I'm excited that this will be one of the last times this will ever happen. I'm almost free.

16,WAE not allowed to perform self-care/hygienic tasks because nParent(s) put themselves in charge of your autonomy?,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb5d41470>,Red_White_And_FUCK_U,0,47,217,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536048803.0,9ctnzp,"I know this a really weird and specific question. To share my example, when I was 11 in 7th grade, during the throes of puberty, I developed really bad cystic acne. I can't recall how this regimen began exactly, but it got to a point where my nMom would lock the two of us in the bathroom at the end of the night (around 9/10 pm), soak a washcloth in scorching hot water, use it to scrape my face like she was trying to scratch old paint off of wood, then would push me up against a wall with her body weight, and use her thumbs/nails to start popping all of my pimples.  

&nbsp; 

The entire ordeal would last 1-2 hours. If I ever spontaneously yelped-out ""OW!"" or twitched my face/body from the pain, she would start slapping my arms and face because I ""hurt her ears from shouting"" or ""messed her up"". Her rationale was that if my acne went unchecked, I would develop pock marks when I was older, so marring my face for 2 hours every night was necessary to protect from any scaring. Naturally, I was too young and stupid to do this on my own, so my nMom would force this on me every night, never showing my how or why I should take care of my face, only that she knew best.  

&nbsp; 

I would go always go to school the next day, having my face decorated with bruises and scabs from all the picking. It got to a point where I found a bathroom at school that no one ever went into at lunch that had a mirror, and started to poke my face. I thought if I could do it myself, I could be more gentle, it would hurt less, and I could go to sleep earlier. When our cleansing ritual rolled around, nMom was infuriated that I ""*destroyed my face behind her back*"" while whipping me with a slipper. After that, when I woke up in the morning, she would take stock of all the fresh new blemishes and document them. It was indicated that if I returned home with scabs where the new pimples had formed, I would be severely punished.  

&nbsp; 

In science class, they would show us an episodes of Bill Nye and there was one where they discussed skin care and warned that breaking the skin could spread bacteria, increasing the possibility of breaking out. I remember feeling this overwhelming sense of relief thinking I would tell my nParents this and I wouldn't have to deal with my nightly abuse anymore. Nope, I ""*was lying*"", and if it actually did happen, a ""*kids shows don't know what it's talking about*"" so the abuse continued. It wasn't until I was a Freshman in High School that my skin got so bad I had to go to a Dermatologist who prescribed me Accutane, while having a sit in with me and my nMom, I asked the Doctor about poking pimples, and he was adamant that was probably one of the worst ways to achieve clear skin and I remember nMom getting visibly agitated/uncomfortable.  

&nbsp;

On the ride home I couldn't help rubbing it in her face, after having to suffer every night for 3 years and she started telling me how I was an ungrateful little ""*shet*"" (*nMom is from South America*) and how God would punish me for not honoring her. When I've brought this instance up as an adult, nMom gasps dramatically while faking crying, saying ""*Ayyyyeeeeeeeee! Senor Jesucristo! I never deed dat! You es lying!*""  

&nbsp;  

Sorry for my Magna Carta of an explanation, but I'm curious if anyone else suffered through similar self-serving abuse / sabotauge disguised as ""help""?"

I don't think my grandmother is really that tired. She may be 80+-years-old, but she keeps herself busy with a few household chores like laundry, sweeping, and cooking. Besides that, she spends the whole day watching TV. The most physical thing she'll do is go for a neighborhood walk, and that's only a few times a week. So I don't think she's really that ""tired"" from being at home all day.

My theory is that my Nmom realized that because she gave that whole spiel about how kids *have* to listen to their parents in front of her mother, her mother will give her a harder time. Because here's the thing, my grandmother has actually been much more vocal about her displeasure about her daughter's behavior in recent years and has even grilled her a few times. Like, properly call her out and bring up all of her bad traits and misdeeds. And I think because Nmom said all that bullshit, her mother might just use that against her. Hence, she's sending her mom back early.

The only sad thing here is that she's sending her mother back during typhoon season, where things are always flooded and getting destroyed. My Nmom would rather put an 80+-year-old woman--who is her own mother, no less--in potential danger than possibly having to deal with said mother scolding her even more than she usually does. But again, I guess the good thing is that this just further reinforces how much of a monster she is."

I've read all over the place that in her condition (suspected antisocial personality disorder), she doesn't even really know she's doing anything wrong and there very little hope at ""fixing"" her, so I just let her yell. I knew that saying anything would make it worse and there was nothing I could say to make it better. So I just let her go. She was going on for so long I was hoping she might realize that *I'm* not the one with an anger problem that she so intently claims I have.

I wasn't as angry as I thought I would be. Normally, I get so mad that she thinks she's in the right and that I lost the fight but I didn't feel that way this time. I was able to acknowledge that it really doesn't matter how she feels, she's always going to feel the same way about me. I've started to settle with the fact that I have a mom who's simply empty. It's not that I've lost anything, there was just never anything there in the first place. It's a shame that it took me so long to realize how to handle it, but at least it'll be easier to go NC.

Soon as she sees it
""Oh it looks too stodgy""

""The slice is too big"" (considering id cut it into 12 when the recipe said to cut it into 8)

""I need ____ with this"" considering id just spent 2 hours on my feet without a break, and she just asks for more.

""Its not even cooked properly"" well maybe if youd not given all our baking stuff away id have been able to practice more, plus my slice was fine, she just had the very middle slice and it wasnt /entirely/ perfect.

I was goddamn proud of that cake, ive never made a blueberry cake before and honestly i think it turned out amazing.
I dont usually do this but i actually told her she'd upset me by complaining repeatedly about it before she actually said anything nice at all. She responded by giving vague and forced compliments about it, probably to keep me happy since im moving out so soon.

And yes, she ate it anyway.

He only notices when I don’t do something. Then he even takes credit for shit that **I** do.

Whenever he sees me it’s, “Oh, do ____”
Basically whenever I see him it’s him telling me to do something for him when he doesn’t do shit for me. 

Then the other day he told me to do the laundry and he was hovering over me while I was doing it. I was putting a vent thing in and he was telling me, “you’re putting it in the wrong way, if you would do it you’d know”. Turns out I was in fact putting it in the right way. Shows what he knows.

I’m belittled for every little thing and I’m never appreciated, I swear.

Then now we just got home and he’s telling me to give the dog a bath and put all the dishes away. He’s always telling me to do his shit like I’m a slave. I can’t even take a shower or relax or anything because he wants to go be lazy and sit on his ass and eat and sleep. Then he tells me I need to do this stuff to be responsible and I’ll need to do it one day and learn but he does NOTHING for himself! Responsible my ass!

It’s funny because he told me I’m selfish, disrespectful, only care for myself, and have no goals. Sounds like him. Honestly he can go to hell. 

There’s a difference between doing chores and being a maid/servant/slave. No respect! Nothing for me! And if he says anything he tells me he feeds me. But that’s the bare minimum. He never paid for shit other than food. Mom did everything else.

My dad is the classic 'i make fun of your sorrows and then act offended when you confront me' type of  narcissist. The classic move of his is to make fun of you relentlessly and taunt you, then, when you give it back to him in the smallest way, he ""crumbles"" and acts super hurt and upset and will go on for days about it. 

So my wife and I have a four month old. My dad and my stepmom came over to visit. My wife usually has to help me mentally prepare when he comes over, and this time was no different. We agreed we were not going to deal with the intentionally hurtful way he treats me, the way he treats me more like a ""thing"" as opposed to a human being. 

So, we have a 4 month old and obviously we are incredibly busy with her, and obviously when you have a new baby you have to make many personal sacrifices; hobbies, interests and sometimes friends have to temporarily take a backseat. 

I've been running a Dungeons and Dragons group for several years, we meet every other week. It's a blast, and I enjoy it immensely, and because of that fact my ndad Hates it, and constantly ridicules me. 

During his visit just now, my stepmom (who is genuinely interested in my life) said enthusiasticly ""I was just telling someone about your d&d... How is it going"" 

""I had to stop,"" I said. ""I don't have time anymore.""

My stepmom started to respond, but my ndad cut in saying ""ahhhhh hhaaaaaa.... Ahhhhh hhaaaaaa....it's overrrrrrrr it's overrrrrrrr"" .... Then he starts slowly singing in a high pitched voice ""it's ovvvvvverrrrrrrr it's ovvvvvverrrrrrrr"" 

We all three just stare at him, perplexed. He keeps going. Finally after another 5-10 seconds my wife goes ""what is wrong with you?"" 

My ndad continues 'singing' ""it's ovvvvvverrrrrrrr"" 

My wife shouts over him ""no one thinks you're funny, we just think you're a rude ass"" 

He stop immediately. ""Oh please,"" he says, ""it's all in good fun"" 

""No it's not,"" my wife snaps back, ""you taking pleasure in your son not being to do something he enjoys isn't 'funny'"" 

""Is this like ... A sensitive issue or something?"" My ndad says. ""because you're acting really ...aggressive"" 

""No,"" I say, having courage now to speak up. ""It's just hilarious how happy you are about other people' misfortunes. What are you, in Jr high school?""

""Eat more food,"" my wife says to him. ""So you can keep your mouth shut ""

""Wow,"" he muttered. ""Just another person I have to add to the list of people I can't be myself around. Just aaaaaad it to the list. Just aaaaaad it to the list"" 

For the next hour of the visit he stayed in the kitchen, pouting, sighing, and silent.

For me I had been preparing for this moment for sometime. I finally in a phone call challenged my mom's  behaviour. I was calm and polite but asked how her (most recent and extremely hurtful) behaviour had made me feel.  Was planning to tell her not to contact me again. I've since learned that narcs cannot handle the word feelings. She swore at me, muttered some spiteful comment and hung up on me. That was over 4 years ago now and she has not contacted me since. I doubt she ever will. She was the 'ignoring' type of narc. I have no contact with any family. My question is, how do you cope with knowing that your parent can cut you out of their life without a backward turn as though you never existed. I feel such a huge sense of rejection. I know and understand she never loved me, nor my father who was a narc too, but I really struggle to make peace with how worthless it makes me feel everyday. I can't help feeling if my own parents can't love me, maybe I'm unlovable. I was so ready to go nc after years and years of gaslighting, cruelty, neglect, but even at the end she took away my one chance to finally make a stand. Thanks for reading.

30,"""You need to cut out the toxic people in your life.""",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb53403c8>,asphaltdragon,0,5,31,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536076985.0,9cwzcs,"I had someone suggest posting this here after seeing it on /r/MaliciousCompliance so I copied it and posted it in full, including my edit.

So this story is actually about a year old, but I remembered it the other day and decided to post it.

Now for a little backstory. I was 26, in-the-closet trans, depressed, and still entirely dependant on my parents for everything. I worked for my dad. I rented a room in my dad's rental house. My parents co-signed my loan on my car. I was securely under my thumb, and they used that to their advantage.

I had a bad habit of not getting out of bed when my alarm went off. Depression is a bitch. And this morning was like any other at this point. Laying in bed at 9AM, after I was supposed to be up at 7AM. Understandably, my dad is angry, and as he has a key to the rental, busts through my door. I really didn't wanna hear it, so I pretended to be asleep.

What followed was the longest, most painful 30 minutes of my life. Apparently I'm terrible at pretending to be asleep, or my dad is terrible at realizing I'm actually awake. He said he knew I was awake, but I still don't know if I believe him. I don't remember what he said, but a few things stuck out to me.

""Your friends are fake, they don't care about you.""

""You are not a transvestite."" (Of course I'm not, that's something different entirely. Validation, yay.)

""I declare death and destruction on those who would misled you."" (Did I mention my parents were religious?)

***""You need to cut these toxic people out of your life.""***

Oh boy, did I take that last bit to heart. I contacted all of my gaming friends to see if any of them had a place I could stay, saved up, bought a bus ticket, and three months later, at midnight, February 1st, I was on a bus travelling ten hours to Houston, with nothing but three suitcases containing my essentials.

Apparently when my dad told me to cut the toxic people out of my life, he didn't realize that was him and my mom. According to my sister, they are not doing as good.

Careful what you preach, I guess.

EDIT: I did not expect this to have the type of response it has. I should probably clarify a few things.

I left because I was being controlled by the things my parents had provided for me. They were holding them over my head. My dad is less to blame for this than my mom is, she was the one that held them over my head.

My dad is not nearly as bad as my mom, and is doing much better. They've both accepted me now, but back then, my entire family was emotionally abusive without realizing it, with the exception of my dad.

They aren't doing much better now, and I am. I don't know the specifics, except my mom cheated on my dad (for the third time, twice within the year). They're supposedly in divorce proceedings now and she's trying to get everything.

My dad had closed down his business that I was working at a few months before I left, and I was helping him flip houses, which he was trying to get into doing. He had taken out a lot of loans, and is most surely in a lot of debt now.

To be honest, if anyone is at fault here, it's my mom. She's narcissistic, controlling, and was basically using my dad, and still is, AFAIK."

It's extremely painful for me to even remotely pay attention for long periods of time (to the point were I'll start crying) so ever since third grade I've kind of just given up on good grades. I'm in highschool now and when I DO try my hardest to apply myself, it still fails. I failed 3 out of 6 classes last year but the school district let one of them slide (it was PE) because there's a lot of health problems in my family. My parents have hounded me about doing homework and asking questions but I just can't do it. I genuinely don't think I'll ever pass highschool, even if I do extremely well on state mandated tests and have a decent vocabulary for my age. Past teachers have said that I had the potential to do great in school, but that's more of what my parents wanted to hear and not what I'm actually capable of doing.
I would love to get help for it but my mom hates going to the doctor's, even if it's a medical emergency because ""they're paid to say stuff"". She's also antivax (my dad isn't, however), and the only reason why I'm fully vaccinated is the laws in my state surrounding them and school. She doesn't think I should have a therapist either because ""I should be able to tell her everything"". So seeking. Mental help is out of the question.
I overheard her talking not even an hour ago that she doesn't like the school officials in my district, and the quality of the schools have gone down since my dad graduated in 82. (I actually agree with her on this). 
She's right, I hate to admit. The school officials are clumsy and messed up my schedule THREE TIMES, a math teacher got fired for having breakdowns in her class and 70% of her students failed, the guidance counselors purposely pick out the students who do well on state tests to make our statistics look higher, and right now I have FOUR teachers that would rather give us packets and group projects than actually teaching us.
I'm four weeks into the school year. I'm falling all of my classes. I hate the school I go to for the life of me, but what really got to me is how she wanted to homeschool me.
Um, no. She didn't go even up to a 9th grade education and thinks vaccines legitimately cause autism. If she homeschools me I'll be more stressed out than I already am. 
I do want out of that atrocious school system though. Maybe there's some way I can convince her that online school is a better option? Help me reddit.

 “Vulnerability in self-esteem which makes narcissistic people very sensitive to ‘injury’ from criticism or defeat. Although they may not show it outwardly, criticism may haunt these individuals and may leave them feeling humiliated, degraded, hollow and empty. They react with disdain, rage, or defiant counterattack.

If you have an argument with a narcissist, they will blame you for making them angry. It’s almost impossible to get your point across because they won’t listen.

What they will do is say that  you criticized them, you’re trying to control them, you are wrong and you need to apologize.

They will then come back oozing charm and seduction, trying to seduce you back into their arms."""

I ended up taking a day trip with my older brother today & once I returned back home, all hell broke loose. My nMother went into my room, searched my bed, looked through an ENTIRE STACK of printed documents and decided to read all of them. Not all of them were filled out nor were about therapy but she decided to bring the forms to my dad and blame him for basically why I'm so fucked up as an adult now. She bombarded me as soon as I came home with waterworks about how this isn't how she envisioned my life & she did everything she could to make sure I was raised correctly. She went on and on about how she didn't mean to read ""the papers"" and since I just got home, I wasn't even sure what papers she was even talking about so I brushed it off.

I'm just so drained and irritated by the whole entire thing. I'm currently taking a leave of absence from college due to my declining mental health & I realized some of my key personality traits are caused by my dysfunctional childhood -- thus why I mentioned the domestic violence & dysfunctional parental relationship. I finally convinced myself to go to therapy & I have been so anxious about this appointment so this is just the icing on the cake.

It really hurts and it keeps locking out randomly while I'm walking, at which moments it feels like it's about to bend the wrong way and snap. Today I wore brick red tights and due to the colour/denier you could really see the contours of my legs, and it turns out - eek - the kneecap that's been bothering me is significantly lower than the healthy one, and kind of twisted inwards. To use medical terminology, it looks fucked. 

Anyway, as soon as I noticed it I went and showed my eMum, who was shocked and agreed with me that it looks wrong. She called my nDad over and his response was:

a), 'what, do you have a bad knee do you?' (I have been mentioning this for **weeks**, and had specific conversations with him about it)

b) 'ha you're just like me then, my right calf is killing me today'

c) 'ah never mind' [end of conversation]

d) It is now 10ish hours later and he's LIMPING AROUND THE HOUSE and mentioning his alleged leg pain every five seconds. I was just showing mum a drawing and he came upstairs for no reason other than to clutch his leg, make some loud 'AH, OWWW' noises, and leave the room again. 

This is not a new pattern of behaviour. It doesn't matter what ailments we have in this house, if my dad hears about them he will instantly claim to be suffering from the same or similar symptoms, and he'll complain about them a lot louder than we do. Occasionally he will also blame us for them for good measure, usually picking whatever lifestyle choice of ours he doesn't like as the cause of the illness. This has actually caused me some issues I'm trying to work through where I blame myself for anything wrong with me and don't seek treatment. It's probably the underlying reason I didn't do anything about this knee for over a month.

I've posted here a few times about my nMom trying to get medical guardianship over me. I am extremely concerned with the direction the case has taken and am looking for advice.

Here is why I am concerned:

1. My attorney is saying my options are basically go to an eating disorder inpatient program or let nMom be my medical guardian (and she would force this too). 
2. nMom and I do not reside in the state where the guardianship case is filed.
3. I have made it clear to my court-appointed attorney that nMom is abusive through evidence such as emails she has sent and that she should not be a guardian of anyone.
4. I went to an assessment for an eating disorder in a state I have never resided in (or even visited before) with a doctor and psychiatrist nMom chose. It doesn't seem like my lawyer fought that. He admitted that nMom probably got to talk to the assessors prior to my assessments.The doctor was very manipulative and disrespectful (and tried to sell me her book - seems like she was trying to gain a new patient (and $$ for her) for her program). I questioned some of her assessments in the appointment and now she's written an assessment of me saying nMom should be allowed to give me psychiatric drugs. The report also tries to make me look bad for being late, even though the court gave me to incorrect address on its order. 
5. Assessment with psychiatrist included her wanting me to comment on my body with pictures taken by a FM relative within my private residence without my knowledge or consent. 
6. Court-appointed attorney told me this had no connection to the court forcing me to attend this assessment: A few weeks before the court ruled that I should go to these assessments, GC brother held me hostage in a canoe for 30+ minutes and would not take me back to shore (despite me screaming for help and pleading out loud to God for help) unless I agreed to go to the doctor who was later appointed by the court (I ""agreed"" but didn't go with him). This was also him holding me hostage with the intent to take me across state lines.

There are more details, this is where I am starting and trying to piece things together. Can anyone help?"

Still there were plenty of things on my wall even when I moved out including a poster size coloring picture of a horse that I had diligently colored for my Great-Grandmother. I had even written on it {Dear Granny I love you double. Love [me]}. That coloring page stayed on my wall from the time she died when I was maybe 10 or 11 til just recently when my Mom took everything off my walls to try and empty out my room because my Dad has turned it into his ‘workshop’ (No never mind the two sheds full of junk in the backyard. He also needs my childhood bedroom.) She has so many paintings and posters rolled up but when I looked through them, that coloring picture wasn’t there. I asked her about it and she said, “It may have gotten thrown away. I didn’t realize it was so important.”

Bitch

Really you didn’t think this picture that’s been on my wall for almost twenty years was important? I almost started crying about it until she said, “I’m sorry I’m such a terrible mother.”

That stopped me because of course I’m not allowed to have feelings in their house. Can’t feel sorry, sad, sick, sore, nothing. So now I just desperately look for it every time I’m at their house but I think it’s a lost cause. She threw it away. I’m not sentimental about almost anything except for things I created for relatives that are gone now, or things they may have given me. I remember being so proud of myself for coloring that big picture and staying in the lines and following the pattern so that the right things were colored the right color. I remember being excited when they put it up in her room at the nursing home.

His wife acts like my aunt, and his daughter a cousin. I had work all day today, knowing they love me, I asked if they were doing anything for Labor Day that I could invite myself to. They told me to get over there. (I moved 2 hours away from my immediate family, they’re the only “family” I’m close to visit up here)

In the evening I mentioned something my mother did that bothered me, and explained that’s why I was there, I was lonely and needed to see people I loved and trusted. She seemed concerned, and suddenly it all poured out. The jokes about my suicidal period, jokes about taking medication for my mental health, the demands of me in comparison to the GC, the emotional abuse, the physical abuse, how I once went 4 months without speaking to my mother.

And then, my aunt began to cry, and jumped up and hugged me, she said she knew it was bad, but she didn’t know what my mom was doing to me. That she was degrading me. 

And finally coming from a family member who knows my mom, and not a therapist. Who loves my mom, but believed me, IMMEDIATELY, was so relieving. She just held me while I grieved for my loss of supportive mother and parents as I reached my final years of maturity. She told me it wasn’t my fault, I didn’t do anything wrong, and that I didn’t deserve it, and that I didn’t owe it to them to visit them.

TL/DR: Never met my real dad, everyone who’s met him says hes an abusive jerk. He tried to friend me on Facebook, then tried to make me feel bad for him, and wanted to build a relationship, when I didnt he called me the daughter of Lucifer. 




So a little back story. I have never personally met my real dad. However I have heard probably everything about him from my siblings who grew up with him, my siblings from his side (and not from my mom) and obviously stories from my mom. I do not take what my mom says to heart, because she has some abusive traits and sometimes I believe she is a narc as well, and because sometimes she embellishes stories. This post is not about her. 
     Anyone that I have talked to about my real dad all say the same thing. He was a lying, manipulative, abusive, psychopath man who will do anything to help himself even if it meant destroying other people. Everyone says that he is also charming, and tries to get on your sweet side. Trying to say that he’s the one getting abused, he’s the one that’s the victim. And then when you show a moment of vulnerability, he destroys you. Financially, mentally and even physically. 
       For awhile I didn’t believe what people said about him. Yeah he was a deadbeat dad who left his kids to starve but surely he couldn’t be that abusive and evil? Right? Well I started trying to fact check everything and cross reference people’s horror stories of him. And yeah it all matched up. So I decided that I was finally okay with not ever meeting my dad and it turning into a wonderful relationship. I put him out of my mind and stopped obsessing over getting a good father, and hoping that everyone was wrong about him.

Well... as my title says, one day I received a friend request from him on Facebook. It weirded me out to no end. I didn’t accept it. I debated accepting and seeing what kind of person he was for myself. I couldn’t decide so I turned to my siblings from his side. They all said block him. But I guess I still kind of was curious what he was like and also super curious as to why he was trying to friend me now, after 20 years of never hearing from him trying to contact me.  So I messaged him (without accepting) and asked simply “why did you send me a friend request?”  Just to see what he’d say. And he didn’t answer til the next day. He said “is there any reason I shouldn’t have?” 

      That made me laugh. I could write a book on all the reasons he shouldn’t. Anyway I kind of laid into him about him never trying to come into my life, he missed his chance, he’s an abusive person, I don’t tolerate abusive people in my life. All that fun stuff. He then tried to tell him my mom left him (if she did, kudos to her) and that he tried to still be a dad but my mom thought it wasn’t best. You know that exact script every dead beat dad has to try to win over their kid. And he’s also saying he never abused anyone and it was my mother that hurt him. (Bull, my brother was like 6 and remembers him beating on her and the smaller kids). 
       I’m getting tired of him trying to twist everything into his favor, so I tell him I have no interest in building a relationship with him, I don’t care about him, I don’t allow abusive people into my life. I’m telling him if he doesn’t see what he did as abuse, that’s on him and he needs to have some self awareness. All the stuff I’ve been wanting to say to him since I realized what kind of person he was. 
  WELL. He did NOT like that one bit! He starts saying that my mother is a wh*re and I’m just like her, that I can’t even stop and think or reason, that I’m just like her. Calls me a total waste of space and air, that he can’t wait til me and my mom dies. Like he  really turned completely around from saying he was the victim and oh poor him to calling my mom every insult in the book and saying he hopes I die. (Real great dad material there). His last message to me before I blocked him was “goodbye daughter of Lucifer and mother of all wh*res.”  (Which really is stupid because he called himself Lucifer).

His last message made it very clear I made the right decision In not wanting a relationship with him. He did get inside my head a little bit and I did feel kind of guilty about not giving him a chance but after reading his last message, the guilt went almost completely away. 
     I’m hoping I did the right thing. I feel like maybe I should’ve given him the benefit of the doubt, but at the same time that would be discrediting all the years my mom and siblings endured abuse from him. Im not sure how I should’ve handled it. "
50,Is this... guilt-tripping? Or am I in the wrong? I don't even know anymore.,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb6b2e160>,toxik0n,0,7,9,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536090254.0,9cz0fs,"I've always considered my parents fairly normal and nice people. They got divorced about 10 years ago, and since then, my dad has been dating a woman. This lady is 100% a narcissist and she's honestly a nightmare to deal with.

But I'm more wondering about my dad. Our relationship has been strained since he started dating this woman and I feel like most of our interactions are him guilt-tripping me. They both seem to place a lot of importance on favours and returning favours. If a favour isn't returned with similar commitment, I get guilted. They both act like selfless martyrs (especially the woman) - except they always expect something in return.

I'm a 30-year old adult, and yes, maybe I don't visit my family enough. I have a full-time job, a husband and two dogs. I barely see my friends once a week, let alone my family. My dad and his partner seem to take this as a personal slight.

When I do see my dad a couple times a month, there are always little, subtle guilt-trippy comments about how I don't visit often enough. Or how I don't do this or that. Usually kind of a ""woe is me"" attitude. He can be very mopey, especially since dealing with an ongoing medical issue the past couple years. 

Our relationship is usually okay, if not slightly strained by the psycho woman he's with, but sometimes he says shit that just makes me want to go no-contact.

For example, I received this text yesterday:

""It was grandma's birthday yesterday. She turned 91. It's not too late to call her and wish her a happy birthday. None of the grandkids called. She would appreciate it.""

Reading it just gave me such a mix of emotions. At first I felt guilty that I missed my grandma's birthday. And I ended up going to visit her today.

But now that I think about it more, it strikes me as so damn passive aggressive. Like my dad chose to text me AFTER her birthday just so he could lay on the guilt. 

Why not text me the day of her birthday and say ""Hey, it's grandma's birthday and I'm heading over there to visit, wanna join me?""

Isn't that the normal thing to do? Or am I just a rude, oblivious person overthinking things?"
51,"""Trauma bonding"" vs ""healthy bonding""",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfacf46c88>,hashedram,0,11,92,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536044093.0,9ct875,"[Trauma bonding](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_bonding)

 I've been reading about this concept and I think this is something anyone who's facing conflicting feelings about whether they actually love their Nparents or hate them should know.

When two people have a healthy relationship, over time they do things together and bond with each other. This is perfectly normal and healthy.

""Trauma bonding"" is a perversion of this. People who experience trauma, generally tend to bond more deeply with the person most available to bonding. This is why soldiers who go into battle together bond so strongly.

Long term abusers and especially N's tend to take advantage of this.


Step 1: The N hurts the victim and causes trauma

Step 2: The N comes back later, with a different personality and validates the victim's pain and emotions. 

Step 3: The N makes sure that they are the only available source of emotional validation to the victim and isolates the victim from other healthy sources. The victim has no voice but to bond deeply with the abuser.

Step 4: Once sufficiently dependent, the N hurts the victim again and the process repeats. Only the bonding is even stronger.

I've experienced these myself and some of the common side effects are

- Not wanting to upset the N, for fear of losing validation.
- Thinking the N will change over time and their not changing is our fault 
- Feeling that they love their abuser and hate them at the same time.

This love simply isn't real. It's an illusion. And understanding that is the first step to getting away.  And for those who have gotten away and feel guilty for still wanting to go back, it's ok to feel that way. But it probably isn't real love. Real love doesn't traumatize."

TL;DR : N friend had issues with her life and health, but as soon as I had problems with my heart, I was a liar. She would ""LOVE me no matter how much I lied.""  She used me to be a martyr. Now Nparents might shack with Nfriend.



I should be working right now. I have so much to get done for clients, and I've wasted my whole day, stressing, being angry, and bitter about this girl who won't leave me alone. But I need to get it out. I need SOMEONE to know.
 Hai. I'm Palaver, and I had a narcissistic friend.  

In this story, we are going to call her Annie. 

I grew up with Nparents, and by the time I realized, it was already a little too late for my sanity. I snapped, packed my bags, and ran away to my boyfriend's house, who's parents, lovingly brought me into their home.  This was ten years ago. Back track seven years, and I will have met Annie at a friend's party. She told me the story about how she came from South Carolina, had been homeless, on drugs, but was now clean, and moving back in with her mom, to help her mom take care of her home. From what I was told, her mom had health problems. (Mainly IBS, but she told me a list of other things that I can't remember now.) Annie is....a little slow to say the least. Common sense ain't common for her, but she was a GENUINELY nice person. Really really fun, happy, bubbly to be around. I figured. Hell. Let's hang out more.

We did, and for seven years our relationship was pretty good for the most part. She was unrealistic as to what her strengths and weaknesses were, ( she considers herself a musician/poet/artist, none of which she does well.)  but I supported her regardless.  I was told all kinds of crazy stories. One of which was when she tried committing suicide by jumping off a short bridge; but before doing so, she tied a red scarf around the railing. So people knew. And would remember the pain that they caused her. Obviously she lived, but I wonder if her brain got a little scrambled. She told me how she didn't remember certain people or events, or how they knew her. She told me about how she had done mean things to people, and now she was trying to make amends with everyone. So apparently, this jump gave her a personality skip as well. 

In her presence, I DID notice that people kinda treated her like shit. She would often send me messages of screen caps of the shitty things people said to her. I was kind of floored at the animosity she was being shown, and more often than not, it was often a jealous wife, or a husband claiming that she needed to leave him alone. I repeatedly told her that she needed to pick a better clan of people to hang out with. That maybe she judged people poorly; but her response was that she could see the good in everyone, and that they always deserve a second chance.  Being her friend, I did my best to give the best advice I could but it did little to stymie her personal drama. 

At one point her mom kicked her out of the house, and told Annie that she didn't need her around to take care of her. Annie broke down telling me that her mom let her be raped, by letting her live with this nasty older ex husband when she was a kid, and that no one believed her. And since it seemed like THE WHOLE town knew about her, and hated her guts (the first obvious sign that completely went over my head.) I figured hey. I live with my boyfriend and his family. Maybe they can help.

Bf's family are kind caring, progressive christian people. They own a farm and there's always a need for an extra pair of hands. I was on my way out of the business at that time; found a school in the state that I'm living in now to pursue my career. Both of us were working hard to get our lives on track, so I figured we could help each other. I was going to need an apartment. She needed her GED, a license, money and a place to stay during that time before she left the state. So with the approval of BF's family, I got her a job, a place to live, helped her study for her GED and let her drive my car to practice, before I ultimately left. The plan was she would join us when she had everything fulfilled that she wanted to have fulfilled. 

Now, this girl never really had a job before. She would do odd ball cleaning for people, and then apparently get fucked over; but she couldn't get a REAL job, because she was on SSI and didn't want the extra money from taxes to interfere with her benefits. BF's father paid her under the table to remedy that issue. Everything seemed fine. She was well on her way. I moved. 

That's when the phone calls started. They were always at 8, 9, 10 pm, and I was usually getting on to the train from school to go home. She would be teary, and crying. Her health was bad. Her feet hurt so badly. Her digestion was fuckie. She had a lump in her armpit. She was vomiting all the time. She just had THINGS wrong with her. She went to the hospital several times for pain that was undiagnosed, as far as I know. She had people drive her to the ER several times in the middle of the night. (Granted it's a farm so we all got up at like. 6am?) The biggest thing that she refused to get help with was her mental health, to which she claimed she was not mentally unwell, but I'm pretty sure she's borderline. Flips on a switch type of thing. I'd seen her do these things before, but she had never played them out on me. I was her BEST friend. Her only friend at the time probably. 

She couldn't work at the farm, it was too hard. BF parents were ""keeping her from getting her education."" This made no sense to me because they had gladly said goodbye to me, when i told them I was going to school out of state. BUT. BF parents are old school in some aspects, so I wondered if BF's dad was being hard on her. These conversations would end with me telling her it was going to be okay. That we just had to get things in order. That she could do this. This was the easy part. She'd be hopeful by the end of the conversation (You're the best Palaver, you're such a good friend, yadda yadda.) and we would end it. Until she would call three-four days later. Same stories. MORE stories.

The family had betrayed her. There was a tenant that stole her stuff. No one would listen. She wanted to lock her door, but BF dad, said no, we don't lock doors in this house. She complained about how much rent she was being charged, which I couldn't stand to listen to because it was 200.00 as opposed to the 850 that I was paying as a family member. But after rent, she had NO money left because of health/medical bills. This all upset me, and made me feel bad. I didn't realize that the environment was going to be so rough for her. it was never my intention of just ""leaving"" her there, but she didn't want to move from out of the state until she had a, b and c checked off from her life list goals. 

Still with me? I appreciate it. 

I worked harder to try and get her to this state before she completely blew a gasket. It was partially my fear that the family would hate me for inviting her idiocy into the home. It was also my fear that Annie would feel abandoned. The calls continued. 

One christmas ago I went and visited the farm. She was still living there at that point, and was getting into a not-so-serious relationship with a boy from a near by farm. She told me that she thought that he was ""stupid and slow."" To which I thought, pot calling the kettle black, but everyone has their threshold of stupidity that they can handle. All I saw however, was that this boy, (Let's call him Brian.) was nothing but a gentleman to her. Drove her to the ER when she needed it, worked her shifts when she was too sick. Made her food, waited on her hand and foot. She wasn't ""interested"" in him and she had told Brian that she was moving out of state with me at some point so don't get attached. Brian agreed that it was important for her to get a higher education. Funny enough, about a month later Brian got some kind of cancerous tumor in his arm. And all of a sudden, she couldn't LEAVE him.  She HAD to help him through his treatments, and that she would join us after he was better. They were going to get married. He was going through chemo and all this other stuff. I DID confirm that at least part of this story was true, but her flip into needing to be a white knight kind of irritated me. But I've never, to this day told her that. 

After all her health problems she comes up to me one day and I'm severely stressing out because I have a heart problem, that's undiagnosed and my heart is beating too slow. (Somewhere between 45-40 BPM) I hadn't told Annie because she was dealing with her own shit. Granted I don't tell most people in my life what's going on except for my BF, but she sussed it out of me, and I told her. She offered very little comfort and immediately started telling me about her mom, and her mom's heart problems. I waved it off, and was like, okay thanks. I didn't think anything about it, and she didn't seem deterred. She even gave me a bunch of phony diagnosis because her mom is a registered nurse. 

Back track now, 6 months ago, a mutual friend of me and my BF went suddenly ill into a diabetic coma, and we thought she was going to die. So we ended up back in the state. During the off time that I wasn't at the hospital, I tried to make some kind of plans to hang out with Annie, since I WAS around and everything. At this point, not-so-serious boyfriend had her living with him in his little shack outside of town because the farm environment was just too hard for her. She had also poisoned him with lies about my BF's family and so he quit as well. We hung out one night together, all three of us, and it seemed fine. Did what we usually did, which was basically shooting the shit and chain-smoking cigarettes.  The next morning, I got messages on my cell from her VIA facebook. She went on and on about how if I was in the hospital she would come and visit me. (Trim my toenails apparently was one of the things she had in mind.) Frankly she's so loud and annoying most times that I told her, I really wouldn't want anyone there but my close family and my bf. We had a big conversation about how she would fight security; stupid conversation you know?  And then the comment, that ticked me off and started everything:

Annie: Well you're broke and your parents don't have money either, someone would have to pay those bills. 

One, I wasn't broke. Two, for some reason, her just telling me that I can't handle my own bills, while she's apparently floundering with her bills AND can't seem to save up for an apartment, kind of made me blow my lid. After she insisted that she would work her ass off for me, I responded that I had a support network and that I could handle those things on my own. Call it a matter of pride I suppose. She then goes to tell me:

You're a dick sometimes.  
Like I'm used to a lot of the stuff you say. You lie sometimes and I just pat it away. My love for you is unconditional because I see your worth as a person, and honestly everyone needs a friend who would go through that amount of trouble to have you around
Nothing you do or say will keep away my loyality. If you push I will be at a distance but with a hopeful spirit.
Simply Palaver,  you're important. Not just to me. But what you do has its affects and I enjoy seeing them

I asked her what I lied about and her response floored me. Here's a small portion of our conversation that I archived, in the event she ever wanted to come back at me with twisted lies.

Annie:  You lie or over exaggerate details. You've done it a lot throughout our friendship. Sometimes I ask why you do it when I've been nothing but honest with you. But I accept it because sometimes its just what you believe or think in the moment and they may not be lies but venting and scenario building. Like a month ago you said you were diagnosed with a heart condition which for years you said you had one. But your ma said you didn't. I didn't care much for what she said but then suddenly youre undiagnosed? And you don't know what's wrong?   Its a small detail but you're important to me so it matters to know what's really going on 

Me:  But know you embellish your own stories. It's a give and take relationship. I don't outright lie. I suspected I had a heart problem. Now I'm being diagnosed. I had no way of actually knowing. I dont know what's wrong, and neither does my cardiologist right now.

Annie:  Why would you tell me you were diagnosed with a heart condition when you still don't know

Me:  
Because I am. I have a condition that causes my heart to beat irregularly, but they don't know why it does. I feel like sometimes you can jump to conclusions without asking the right questions. I have no reason to lie about that
Lol like why?
I was telling you because I was stressed and going through the testing


The convo goes on and on with more petty bullshit, her response to this was,"" well I don't believe you, and I talked to your mom and she doesn't remember you having a heart problem at all.""  That I lied about that, that I lied about dropping out of school. Then it was; you don't know what suffering is. You've always had BF's family since you were a little girl. I've always been on my own, and homeless. No one helps me. No one supports me. Generic solutions aren't going to fix my problems. I'm not like other people. Your advice is useless for someone who has nothing.  It's like telling African children to grow a garden without seeds.  I slept in drug houses and under bridges. I did whatever I could to just survive. Palaver, as much as you want to believe we are similar. Our history is not.""

I got sick of her pity cries at this point. Called her out for wallowing in it. At this point, she must NOT have wanted me to be able to save any part of the convo, because she started talking to me through voice recordings. They're mostly incomprehensible saying me, me, me, life is too hard.  Put yourself in my shoes. Even though when I tried, I could never compare to her painful existence. 

Pain poker. It had literally become a game of pain poker. And I realized; this is what she did to other people, but now she has her boyfriend. She had Brian. And because she had Brian, there was a safety net for her to create drama. I was no longer safe from her. The kicker to the conversation was when she told me no matter what I did she would always love me and be loyal. Even from afar. Essentially, I tell lies, and she's the martyr who's a good person no matter what. I told her I didn't want to be that kind of friend for her. That if that was how she viewed our relationship, that I had, essentially, become a toxic friend to her, enabling her delusions. She got upset about this, and blocked me on facebook, after getting the last word.

I'm not one for petty blocks and unblocks. I just don't play with that shit. She decided to cut the tie right then and there by throwing a tantrum and blocking me. So I said fine. I blocked her back. I blocked her number. I blocked every aspect of her from my life. She sent her BF Brian after me to tell me that I was mean, and that I hurt her feelings. That ""I need to talk to her now.""  I said. Okay. Then I blocked him too. 

Obviously because the situation wasn't resolved for her,  she's made her rounds calling my family, trying to worm her way in any way she can.

She messages BF parents telling them that 'she misses the farm and that she loves everyone."" She called my Aunt Sally's cell phone (somehow she got the number?) asking how Grandma was, and that she would like to take them out to eat. Aunt Sally knows this girl's crazy, and tried to explain that she understood that me and Annie had a falling out, to which Annie promptly responded, ""Well it's more Palaver's fault than mine."" 

Her recent stunt has included talking to my mom on facebook. I'm still in contact with both Nparents, though at a distance, and I limit my phone conversations with them before I get hostile.  My nparents, who are pretty brain dead, are in the process of being homeless. Now I'm in no financial or homing situation where I can help them get back on their feet, so even if I wanted to I can't.  My mom had posted something on facebook along the lines of, ""we might be homeless, if such and such doesn't play out well."" Annie messaged my mom, who then in turn showed me screen caps of what was sent. Basically along the lines of:

Here's my contact information. I know Palaver can't help you, and because I couldn't move out of the state like I planned, I was homeless for a while so I know how that goes. I completely understand I'm always here for you."" 

This would be my greatest nightmare come true if Nparents ended up shacking with Nfriend. I told my mom not to take her up on her offer, and she responded by telling me ""Well I'm not going to burn any bridges."" I immediately flipped my shit and told Nmom (who's emotional manipulation I learned from her no doubt) that if she did take Annie up on her offer that I wouldn't be able to talk to her anymore.  This was just one more power play. One more way for Nfriend to try and get under my skin and into my life. One more way for Annie to tell everyone what a GOOD person she is.  I didn't tell my mom that I would cut her out of my life to be manipulative; but for my own emotional health and sanity, I just couldn't allow it to enter my life. That and I obviously want to help my parents, so it make me look like a shit person. Also a quick check with nmom has confirmed that Annie NEVER spoke to her about my health problems. 

Not to mention my fake heart condition has me pretty ill today. I'm pretty sure my irregular heart rates are because of my lack of stress management, and this today, has certainly proved that. 

I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to ever get this girl out of my life. I just want it to end. I feel stupid for ever trying to help her to begin with. I've taken the higher road as much as possible and I haven't communicated with her on any level since blocking her from my life. I know she's poking. She's poking to get a reaction. She does this until people snap and say horrible horrible things about her.  She brings the worst out in people. 

I'm pretty sure she might actually be a demon. "

Drunk narc logic is even worse) and I don’t even know what I’m saying anymore. I’m shaking.

Here’s to another shitty year and a whole life that never gets better because I’m an incapable useless idiot. I’m so so sorry, but at this point I’m so tired of asking my friends to listen to my problems all the time. They are amazing people, but I know it’s exhausting and it doesn’t seem to be getting better and I don’t want to keep feeling like a burden to them. I’m so tired of everything. I feel exhausted and hopeless and in shock at the same time. I’m so so tired of everything. Life never got better these last 28 years and I can’t blame everything and everyone else if I’m still unable to make it change. But I’m so exhausted and I feel desperate. I’m so tired of living feeling the way I do 24/7"

Where I had pull you out of ??autism, bed wetting, feeding problem, rashes, allergy and be there for you every single day of your life. Which dream of yours did not come thru? When was it that you ever asked to speak to the two person who gave their life for you, Appa and Amma? Did you volunteer to take care of Amma even one day. She changed your pampers and changed it to cloth pampers when you had rashes. She spend her whole day feeding you. Even when she fell sick, did you feed her even once? Did you change her soiled pampers even once? Did you bother to be there for your sister who hero worshipped you all her life? She was going thru the darkest part of her life, did you bother to at least message her or give her at least a 1 minute call? So, please don’t point at me a say I was bad.

I will always be thankful for the opportunities that got me away from her and enabled me to seek help. However, I will never forget the abuse, and how it affects me to this day. Yes maybe I wasn't the perfect child and had issues being withdrawn at school, but why did that mean it had to be beaten out of me EVERY SINGLE DAY? Why didn't she get proper help? One can still succeed in life without being put through the abuse I went through.

It was mostly autoimmune and IBS-type things. I learned to hide my suffering (we all know what it’s like to be sick around N’s) so I wouldn’t be tormented anymore. For the most part, it worked. They had no clue when things were going on.

Things got REALLY bad in college as I was bedridden with full body pain, autoimmune symptoms, and unable to keep water down. Essentially, dying slowly. Hid that too.

I was finally diagnosed and treated for Endometriosis which was really severe and destroying my daily life since middle school. My period was always hell and suspected it, but I get confused when I read others’ experiences like “I couldn’t get out of bed,” “couldn’t go to school,” “debilitating,” etc. I’m like “What are you talking about?” 

Every time since starting, I was violently sick from both ends, screaming in pain, tunnel vision-ing, shaking, but could walk out of the bathroom as if I was absolutely fine. The pain was more manageable at school because I knew that I had to push through and learned how to stop myself from passing out. Maybe it’s because I had a distraction?

QUESTION: It was as if I could turn the pain “on and off.”  That I could be in as much pain as I “allowed” my body to be in. Now that I’ve had my Endo surgery and am not in as much pain, I am realizing just how bad it was and am horrified how ANYONE could hide THAT much unimaginable, incomprehensible pain as if nothing is happening. I can’t even wrap my brain around how much pain I was in. Now that I ""allow"" myself to feel it, I'm feeling it.

Literally what even?! Is this even a thing? Don’t know if it’s a trauma skill of dissociating (a useful one) or some amazing willpower. I had been practicing it since I was a child and still continue today. Obviously the need to be fine for the N’s would play a large part in this. But I think you can push yourself and dissociate through any pain if needed.

59,Haven't posted here before. Nice to see a Reddit community like this. Been having a hard time with NC and anger recently.,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfacf4f550>,EmanResuFignewton,0,1,3,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536116002.0,9d2d76,"So for a little background, my NMom is a mess. She was abusive, neglectful, and manipulative my entire childhood... I moved in with my dad at 13 but the damage was already done. Was in and out of hospitals for mental health between 13 and 19. She was still a part of my life, and her proximity made it hard for me to see that most of not all of my issues have come from the way she treated me.

September 29th, 2016, she took off and ditched my father and I. She was living with us, strictly as a roommate. She got angry about the money she was paying toward bills, and took off in the middle of the day while my father and I were both out of the house. No warning. This was the third time in the last four years prior she pulled something like thay, and something in me just snapped. I cut her off completely. I was 21, almost 22.

I'm now almost 24. My mental health treatment is finally *helping* because I'm actually getting to the core of the issues since I'm no longer in her sphere of influence. I'm dating a wonderful man who plans to propose soon. Everything in my life is getting so much better. I have zero contact with anyone who would be able to give her any information whatsoever about me.

I don't want to reform a relationship with her. What I want is to rub it in her face how much better I've become. How quickly my life went uphill when I cut her off like a malignant tumor. I want to contact her just to say ""SEE! Look what I can do!"" I know this would be stupid, and I know I would never actually do it. But I am full of so much *anger* I don't know how to swallow it. I am almost 24 years old. I am an adult. But I want to throw everything in her face. I want to make a point by point list of her atrocities, and read it six inches from her face while she sobs, which she would because she is *always* the victim. I am so ANGRY and I just have no idea how to move past it. The sadness is gone, the desperation for the life I could have had if she was never in my life is fading. But the anger is still burning in me and it's so toxic, but I can't figure out how to take it away.

A few months before she took off, there was a moment where she was screaming about something or other, inches from my face, spitting poison. I just wanted her to shut the fuck up. I was just so done. I grabbed her forearm to push her away from me, something I have NEVER done before. But suddenly I couldn't let go. I felt my hand squeeze, but it felt like I wasn't controlling it. She saw it in my face, and she whipped her arm away. I've swear it's like an untapped rage appeared in that moment and hasn't gone away. That was the scariest moment of my life. She has always made me feel like a pathetic, scared little girl, who she could control with her bellowing screaming and in that moment I just snapped. I couldn't fucking stand it, I couldn't stand her screaming in my fucking face for one more second. I'm still grateful she pulled away, because I genuinely don't know what I would have ended up doing had she not. I was squeezing her arm hard, but I just wanted to break it in half.

I am so scared of the woman I was in that moment, but it still feels like she exists so much in me. That angry, broken person who wants to break my mother's face.

I just don't know how to make this anger go away.

This ended up being a long rant. Thank you if you ended up reading it."

On a side note- Is there anything I can do? I have no ability to GET the money, and no other adult figure in my life who can help me to do so. I’m afraid my options are limited as i’m not a legal adult in my province until I am 19 and nobody believes in her abuse. Hell sometimes I don’t even believe it.

62,Just realizing how deep my issues of being raised by a narcissistic father really are.,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb692af98>,krajile,0,1,2,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536115577.0,9d2b6g,"I (39F) have to backtrack a little to start. Between the ages of 25-34 I was in an on-again off-again relationship with a guy who loved me. Or he said he did. And he acted like he did. But sometimes he'd be lying. Or would he be. Things wouldn't make sense, stories didn't add up. I was wrong of course. He loved me. He told me so. He bought me things. He took care of me when I was sick. But then whose number is that? I thought you said you were at X, how did you end up at Y? Why can you never answer my calls? Nothing made sense. He loved me, but his actions (some of them) were saying he didn't care and that he didn't respect me (but sometimes they did). I was so confused.

I'm 39 now. I was raised by a narcissistic father. I first identified his traits when I was in my early 20's and tried my best since then to not let it affect me. I still occasionally fell in his trap where I expected something of a father and was let down. Silly me. 

My mom died 3 years ago. My kind, caring, loving, (submissive) mom. My dad would stay in touch with me weekly; suggest we go for dinner, etc. This was crazy- I wouldn't ever hear from him when my mom was alive. Is he trying to make amends? Has he learned the value of family? Does he realize that he's my only parent and he's not going to let me down? I had high hopes. He was still a narcissist over dinner. Just talked about himself,  his work, etc. He wouldn't ask me how I was, how my new job was, if I was doing ok. I didn't expect it, really, so it was fine. He's alone now so I kinda feel sorry for him too.   
He went on vacation 3 months ago to his home country. A few weeks in he sent some pictures; I responded asking how everything was going, how the weather was, etc. No response. A few more weeks..pictures of a beach....a month later...another beach picture. No words. I stopped replying, aside from a ""nice beach"" once. Eventually he comes back and texts ""if you're free, come over for bbq"". I hadn't talked to my dad in months and he doesn't even start with ""hello"" or, crazier yet, ""how are you?"". 

I was in a bad mood at that moment so I drafted an angry, nasty message which my current bf with loving parents told me was too harsh. Fine, I changed it. I simply said ""Sorry dad, I can't come over. You haven't asked me how I am in 3 months. How do you think that make me feel? It makes me feel like you don't really care and only message me when you're bored."" His response? ""Well I tried sending a few messages but your responses were so short that it didn't really leave me any room to ask you anything"". 

Here's where we finally circle back to the story at the start of my post. I find myself feeling exactly what I felt in that relationship- but he loves me right? He cares. He shows he cares in some ways. But what about when he shows he doesn't care? Which is the truth? How do I know? I 100% do not trust my ability to recognize when somebody does or doesn't care about me. I have no idea what is real. That is the depth of damage caused by narcissistic parents, particularly fathers of daughters. But you all knew that."

However, this self-medication is probably not a safe strategy for continuous use on a long term basis due to dangers of addiction and/or damage.

And my mom is a complete enabler. My husband and I are in the process of going VLC with both of them. But until about 10 years ago (I'm 44 now), I would have told you they were two of my favorite people on earth.

Looking back, I see that many of the nice things my dad did were for the purpose of keeping up appearances (like making sure I went to a good college and a good graduate school in a field of study that were ultimately completely wrong for me but that he thought would impress people). But I also recall him teaching me solid ethics--which he himself has never adhered to--and being genuinely and appropriately affectionate.

It's hard to reconcile all that with the person I see now, who has gotten more overtly mean and self-centered with age. I also think I was the golden child--my scapegoat brother probably has a very different take on things. I know, looking back, that I toed the line really well for a very long time without realizing that that was what I was being raised to do.

I guess I feel like a complete idiot--I know many narcissists try to maintain an image of the perfect family to the outside world, which my dad completely did, but I fell for it, too. My husband has gradually been helping me see things as they really are--my dad, incidentally, is HORRIBLE to my husband and always has been, in addition to being alternately annoyed with/indifferent to our children, I think because their world does not revolve around him, and because my husband helped open my eyes. My dad only wants to deal with people who are broken or otherwise easily manipulated.

Now my sixteenth birthday is in two weeks, and her birthday is 3 days before mine. She wants to get together for a birthday lunch and says she got me a gift. Yeah that’s sweet of her, but I know she uses gifts against people later to guilt trip to her advantage.

My dad says I should probably send her flowers and meet up just to be nice, but I don’t want her more involved in my life. She sets my anxiety off majorly (I wasn’t able to eat anything for 2 weeks without throwing up afterwards when she blew up at me last)

I’ve been taking her attacks for years. She’s always perfect and can do no wrong in her mind. She’d lied and twisted literally every event that happened in the past, and blamed me for the neglect she caused. I’m sick of constantly tip toeing around her and being the *adult* who mends things.

I don’t want her in my life and I know she’ll try to worm her way into my life moreso if I meet up with her.

I guess my question is, would I be a horrible daughter if I just kinda, blow off the lunch offer, and her birthday, and basically ignore her? I feel bad just thinking about it.

She'll want to talk to me and give me money on occasion so it makes me feel guilty for not liking her. How do you deal with narcissitsts who act nice but are also narcissitstic?"
71,Does anybody notice that their narcissist defense mechanisms lead to problems at work?,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb8364358>,DrankTooMuchMead,0,5,2,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536112428.0,9d1x9y,"Almost every job site seems to have a narcissist. I've had over 12 jobs since 2001, and most of those have played out like this: I will do my best to be nice to everyone, someone suddenly decides they don't like me and then tries to manipulate everyone into hating me and getting me fired. I couldn't understand why the terrible luck. And why was it that the nicer I acted, the more I would be screwed?

I really tried to pay attention to myself with a new job. I noticed within the first week, a certain guy on occasion would get into my face (inches away) and start yelling about things wrong with other employees. Not only did I not back off, I would make faces at him each time like, ""what the fuck's your problem, lunatic?"" This is something so unconcious that i never really noticed i did this, in the past. I now realize it wasn't indeed anything I ever said, but my expressions that have been pissing off the local narcissist.  A face that says, ""you can't control me and you're an idiot for trying."" They try to manipulate me emotionally, and their bullets bounce back, making them feel insecure somehow. When this guy couldn't manipulate me, he immediately went to the manager and thought up some bullshit to complain about me. He had only seen me a couple times so he complained about my attendance.

Does anybody have anymore insight into why they are so insecure? I tend to be seen as a threat to a narcissist that must be purged from their little world as fast as possible.

The thing I hate the most about narcissists is the way they manipulate the weak minded. All of these assholes/bitches have their managers *believing* any weird thing they make up and complain about you. Even if the manager is nice otherwise, they tend to look at the narcissist like they are their kid or something."

She’s gotten better over the years but would still probably consider her an nSIL. 

She has a 5yo daughter (E) who is a sweet, spunky, caring, sensitive little girl. Father is not in the picture after some custody issues (seriously a good thing, even with an nMom). My future MIL enables watches E a few days each week but largely doesn’t do much to curb nSIL’s behavior. 

My fiancé and I want to do what we can to help E have a good childhood despite the circumstances and try our best to confront nSIL when we can about N behaviors. But we also don’t want to push it too far and have her pull a NC (unlikely but still want to be safe). 

Any tips for how to help E deal with it all as she grows up? Things we can do to support her and show her that nSIL behavior isn’t normal? We’ve always reminded E that she can talk to us about anything and we are a safe place and we love her.

Nmom told me yesterday that Ndad told her he knows he’s bipolar. My brother & I have no relationship with him, and it wasn’t easy for us as kids. Nmom says: “so hopefully this helps you understand why he says & does the stuff he does.” Well ok, but it doesn’t excuse it, and my bro and i bore the brunt of his cruel sarcastic remarks, backstabbing & total emotional unavailability all our lives. 

As usual, my mom said that she’s “stuck in the middle” of us 3 because bro & I keep VLC with Ndad, and that she’s affected the most by it cuz she’s his wife. She seriously expects us to *try harder* & have a relationship with him. We’ve tried. We get hurt every.single.time. I let go of him over a year ago & only call on bdays, etc. I am sorry for him that he suffers from this, but he chose not to get help, treat us like shit & then expects respect & connection. And my mom uses tears as usual. I told her I’d had enough of all the sarcasm & crap, and she’s like, “when did he make the sarcastic remarks? If I knew it happened, I would’ve stopped it.” And I told her about the times he said terrible things about me to Nmom and then she’d tell me what he said. Her response?? “I just can’t see why I’d tell you things like that.” Wow, how invalidating. 

I told Nmom I began working thru the pain of no relationship w Ndad 4 years ago, and feel little to no emotion about it now. She kept dropping in conversation that I’m “beginning healing”, like no, you have no idea where I’m at, and you can’t because you’re still making excuses for Ndad & can’t accept that I’m not a pliable teen/20-something anymore.

When I was a teenager I LOVED the emo/scene look and I wanted to dress that way desperately, (cringe I know) but if I wore anything black, anything at all really, my mother and her sister relentlessly made fun of me. Makeup? Passive aggressive comments about being a slut, no makeup? You look boring, ""normal clothes""? You look like you don't care, anything black? You look ridiculous what's wrong with you? The only time she ever said anything positive about my appearance was when I would wear anything similar to what she wore when she was a teenager. Now, I never got to dress as a cringey little scene kid, I never got to experience being part of a group because I was too afraid of ridicule, and even now as an adult I struggle with how I'm perceived when I dress. Regardless of what I wear I just hear her telling me I look stupid. Nothing looks right on my body because of her and I can't stand it.

-also, he’s 1 inch shorter than me. She told me that if a man isn’t at least 4 inches taller than me (I’m 5’10” so that narrows things down) I shouldn’t even speak to him because I look “like a mother talking to a baby” (??!!) 


-she says that she’d much prefer if I had an older man (40+, I’m 19) who was a doctor or something of the sort who could give me money without me doing anything.

80,"Years ago, I was suicidal. I'm good now, but I feel I have to tell someone about this time.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb3718240>,Sanftmut,0,2,12,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536078632.0,9cx8x9,"So... the thing is, I never told people I had suicidal thoughts, because I felt it was unfair to do that. Probably because my father sometimes used it as a threat to us. And because I didn't want to be a burden to someone else, and thinking I could kill myself would be a burden for other people. Even if I was never close to do it. 

I remember that I didn't want those thoughts. They just came. I mean, it might be obvious that you don't want to be suicidal, but it frightened me how subtly they slid into my conciousness. Like a warmhearted, creepy whisper telling me the pain could be gone. And I remember some stupid thought like ""Oh, that's how you get those thoughts"", because before I wondered why people could ever see that as an option. And I felt like it's really wrong to think that and that telling someone would be emotional blackmailing to care for me. I guess I wanted that someone cared without that... 

&#x200B;

And even years later... when I tried to tell people I have depression and they were like ""No, you are fine. Look at how much you've accomplished"" I never used the argument of ""But I was suicidal, so I guess it really was bad."" I felt like I had to keep that fact to myself, because it's so severe it would force people to do something about it or at least to believe me... or maybe I was afraid it would just sound like that ""attention seeking"" thing and make everything worse. 

&#x200B;

I don't know. I never told someone. But often I wished someone knew. I wished someone cared about the fact that I was so miserable life felt unbearable. 

&#x200B;

I also had a very angry period. After I had tried to tell people about my depression and they didn't believe me, I had really angry thoughts of killing myself just to show them they were wrong. I wanted to write a farewell letter only saying ""You could have known"". In this period things were already getting better and my anger was probably a healthy sign of me feeling my needs. Though sometimes the anger got so massive I felt like going crazy and was really afraid I might act on that anger. Afraid of losing control over everything. I remember that I told myself in those moment ""It will be gone in ten minutes. You just have to deal with this for ten minutes. You can do that"", and I went outside my flat and just walked. Kept walking and telling myself that in ten minutes, I will regain the feeling that I want to live. I usually calmed down, went  home and cried about my life. 

&#x200B;

I guess these thoughts are part of my past, and I want them to be a part of my story. Maybe just because it's the truth. I don't want to exclude that part anymore, I don't want to live up to that image other people created for me. 

&#x200B;

I'm not good at trusting that people would help me. So maybe, keeping those thoughts for myself was also to protect myself from any reactions that would have made it worse. Currently, I'm trying to learn to let people see when I need them. Let them see when I need some care. Maybe that's why I want this off my chest now. I want to tell someone that I was at this dark place with little to no hope. I'm not that strong, happy person everyone else sees in me. (Please don't say: ""But you are strong for fighting depression"" or anything in that direction. Might be true, but my whole life that kind of argument was used to gaslight me into thinking I don't need or deserve help.)

Shows me the oil thing then tells me she'll go to a different Walmart so I don't have to be seen with her. That I insulted her. Asks what happened to me. Says, ""I'm done with you."" and storms off. 

I texted her an apology saying it wasn't personal I just wanted to be able to shop and look around because she doesn't like that. She responds by saying ""It is personal. You did want me going to the murder mystery with you. You did not want me going to see a movie with you. It is all well and good when you need for something, but heaven forbid I should simply want the pleasure of your company. Your actions speak volumes."" The murder mystery was an on campus event at college that when I told her I was going she asked to come and I said I didn't want that. I also spent $200 on going with her to a murder mystery party that wasn't on campus. The movies is I think in reference to going to see a movie for my birthday with David and Sarah. Keep in mind I have offered to go to the movies with her separately than that but she always declines. 

I'm 22 and just go my license. She's been driving me to and from work this summer and I always said thank you. 

I'm planning a murder mystery for her birthday. I don't know what's going to happen with that. 

I moved out of their house to get away from my awful father and I'm staying with a friend of hers. I pay rent to him, but I don't know if this will affect that.

I can't afford a real apartment on my own at the moment. I'm trying to get a second job so I can but I'm not getting anything so far. 

Update: She just called me crying about how I've broken her heart and insulted her. Because I don't text her to ask how she's doing or call her up. She wants to know if me planning this party will be an imposition on her, I said no. I tried to reassure her I still want a relationship. She says I have to ""figure this out"" for myself on having a ""close"" (read: codependent) relationship with her. She knows moving back home would be hell for me, it's hell for her being there.

84,"Teenage cousin being abused by her nmom, what do I do?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb3714be0>,ImmediateEjection,0,2,5,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536095853.0,9cztn0,"[TW physical and emotional abuse]

My cousin (pseudonym for story purposes is Alice) is 16 years old and has recently disclosed that she has been physically and emotionally abused by her mother since she was 5. She is an only child. 

Recently, Alice has been in trouble with the law. The first time, she allegedly chased her mother with a kitchen knife, the second time, she physically hit a neighbor. Alice insists that she did not chase her mother with the knife and she says that she did hit the neighbor but that the neighbor was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. (She said that her mother had started a physical altercation with her that was brought to the neighbor’s home, during which Alice lashed out at the neighbor.) Alice was placed in the custody of my mother (her aunt) and has been for about two weeks.

For background, Alice says that her mother will physically attack her (holding her by the face, pulling her hair, slamming her onto the ground, punching her, etc.), then when Alice tries to defend herself, her mother calls the police and reports that her daughter is abusing her. The attacks are unprovoked and seem to be sparked by a 16 year old acting like a 16 year old - slightly bratty, a little sarcastic, but nothing major.

Alice says that if she is upset, her mother immediately becomes angry and tells her how much harder her own life is than Alice’s. Alice is unable to talk to her mother or receive advice from her because she is so aggressive. Her mother will call her horrible names (ex. Slut) or say terrible things (ex. I wish I never had you.) Since Alice has been with my mother, her mother keeps saying that Alice is hurting her by not answering her calls or texts. She says that Alice is rude for not doing so. It seems like everything is about Alice’s mother.

Alice herself is a very small, timid girl who was spoiled by her mother. She is a little bratty but all teenagers are. I’ve never seen her be aggressive or violent with anyone but her mother. She went to court over the neighbor battery charge and the judge is determined to send Alice back to her mother after two individual counseling sessions each and two group counseling sessions together.

Alice’s mother has never been diagnosed but I’m pretty sure she’s a narcissist. I know that people with personality disorders rarely get better and I am nervous about the fact that Alice may have to go live there again. Alice didn’t speak up during the court hearing about her physical fights with her mother as being self-defense because her mother was present.

I’m worried about her. What can I do to keep her with my mother and, therefore, safe? If Alice has the police called on her again, she will go to juvenile detention. She’s not that kind of kid but everyone believes her mother over her.

Thank you for any help you can give."

Looks like I won't have to start saving like crazy to buy a new car for the time being as my old one is actually still drivable. My NDad had called for our auto insurance to send a truck to pick it up from the body shop and he test drived it to verify if it really was *""supposedly damaged""* and nothing happened. In a way I feel cheated that this happened and that I had to cough up a decent amount of my savings just because of my actions. I could blame it on not taking my medication that day, or for panicking and allowing myself to be intimidated, but that's not responsible at all.

My car is safely home now but the driver who dropped it off didn't bother to ring the doorbell to give me back my car key or the receipt, a *huge* oversight on his part for not completing his job, so now I need to go pick it up later this week.

I admit to feeling rather guilty and I've learned my lesson in that once my internship starts next week, I won't be driving downtown myself anymore and will have to go through the dreaded park-and-ride.

My childhood was just a series of ""you're going to grow up homeless,"" ""you'll be just like your mother,"" ""where you're heading you'll be a prostitute on the streets by 18."" Most of this was a result of him being unhappy with my average (C's) grades. Math was one of my worst subjects growing up, no matter what grade I was in, I couldn't understand it.

I was eligable for special classes (there's a possibility I'm Autistic. Most of the family seems to think so) but Dad completely shot them down. According to him, the problem wasn't that I was ""stupid,"" it was that I was lazy and just never applied myself. He'd turn me down when I asked if I could get tutoring, completely refused to help me with homework, and even instructed whoever his girlfriends were at the time to not help me. It's like he just expected me to be a straight A student, but was appalled by the very notion that I couldn't just achieve that naturally.

I was always being put down or compared to. When I was 13 (14?), my dad once told his girlfriend, right in front of me, that his oldest son was the only one of his kids he's ever been proud of. Albeit, he was blackout drunk at the time (he's an alcoholic.) Not sure if that makes it better or worse. I distinctly remember him telling me once that he would hate me if I weren't his daughter. Many times he's told me he wasn't surprised that I didn't have friends. I've been called stupid more times than I could count, been told to fuck myself once, was accused of having a creepy father-complex a few times (this one completely floored me, since it was in response to me saying I didn't want to have to hear him having loud, screaming sex everynight at 14 years old. His room was just a very thin wall away from mine).

One time, when I was 15, I told him I wanted to kill myself. He completely blew a fuse, told me every woman whose ever told him that was just looking for attention. I was sent to my room and grounded for a week. Even to this day, despite being hospitalized when I was 17 due to chronic suicidal tendencies, he denies that I even have depression. He made a habit of hiding my antidepressants from me and even stole most of my bottles and locked them in his closet. I now live many states away from him and he still refuses to hand over my meds. I still remember him sitting me down and guilt-tripping me into watch an anti-medication movie (ProzacNation) with him to try to sway me away from the meds.

I'm 19 now. I've hit a stage in our relationship where I just refuse to talk to him, every conversation we had was just him telling me I'm gonna be a sex slave or a prostitute when I hit 25. There's a lot of bitterness. I dwell a lot on where I'd be right now if I was raised by a normal father. I know that man loves me, and I know he feels at least a sliver of guilt over the way he treated me. I've never gotten an apology, though. And that's what really stings."
91,"Want to go NC with nmum but don’t want to run away and leave the others to deal with her by themselves, or leave them behind if I can/should help them?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfae947128>,Eoin2898,0,2,2,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536107237.0,9d1alt,"Sorry a little ranty, not urgent, would love some advice if you have any going spare!

Twin sister realised about nmum years ago, because she was main scapegoat kid
I realised about a month ago
I’m all for going NC

Twin treated worst as kid but hasn’t gone NC
I was golden child till mental health took a nosedive, but still did whatever nmum asked (no matter what) so never overtly abused
So I don’t have clear/definitive explanation for the family for why going NC

Have read from a few different sources that trying to help a narcissist is futile and NC is best/healthiest way to go
Is this true?

I have a twin sister(20), a younger brother(14), and estepdad (who is naturally anxious/low self-esteem so is easily manipulated).
From what I can tell they’re all victims of nmum, so would like to stay in contact w them


I want to go NC with nmum and never go back to family house: only meet up w family elsewhere, and stay in contact by phone
Is that selfish?
Should I stay and actively try to break the others out the cycle of nmum’s emotional abuse? 
Would going NC just be callously leaving them behind to deal with nmum themselves, when actually I could/should help them break out/away?

Twin is the only other person aware of nmum: if brother and estepdad aren’t ‘awake’ yet
Is realising what Nmum is something only they can do for themselves? 
Or is that just a lie/excuse I’m telling myself so I can just run away with minimal guilt?

Nmum is a covert narcissist so I wouldn’t know where to start about telling someone or asking for advice

Don’t want my NC w nmum to make her treat the others worse
Don’t want to run away and leave them to deal with it by themselves

Nmum had a traumatic childhood so being this way is most likely a side effect of that trauma
Does that mean I should try harder to help her be less narcissistic, or does it make no difference?

Sorry for the long post, thank you for reading! Any and all advice very much welcome!"
92,nMom: I just needed the attention,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb22cc3c8>,dohako,0,11,18,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536065189.0,9cv9rv,"My nMom has been suffering from dementia for a few years. After visiting her for a week to relieve eDad of some of the overwhelming duties he's happy to take on. I can see it: Her narc attitudes are still playing out well: 

* nMom regularly pees on the bed, and eDad refuses to give her diapers as they are not comfortable. So if she says she needs to go to the toilet, we jump. Twice in the last week she asked me to the toilet within minutes of going the last time. Then nothing happens. She keeps trying for 30 minutes, I ask every 5 if she is done. As we walk back she says: ""I did not need the toilet, but I like that you kept giving me attention. 
* nMom - unable to walk by herself is in constant pain. She permanently sings in a whimpering voice. I ask if she wants pain killers. ""No"". I ask her if she notices that she makes those sounds. ""No pain killers"". I ask her if she can try not to make the noise ""You don't give me any attention if I'm quiet. 
* nMom - is hungry and wants to eat. She is struggling with a spoon but insists my dad gives her all the fruit she has for breakfast cut into tiny pieces. I decide to cut it into larger pieces she can eat by herself and won't need a spoon for. She complains. When I ask why it's not easier like this her reply is: ""I want you to help me with the spoon, I don't want to eat by myself"". We still set there, next to her but we can feed ourselves. 

I'm honestly thinking the next time I help her to relief my dad I'll check her into short term nursing care. "
93,DAE recognize N traits within themselves?,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb594a8d0>,purseEffphony,0,1,1,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536120421.0,9d2vw9,"Yesterday i picked a fight with my husband.

Basically i'm very good at reading when others are unhappy with me.  It makes me anxious and sers off the alarm bells.  Because growing up it was the silent treatment before the storm. Husband has his moments but nothing (not even close) like what I experienced from my malignant NParent. 

Anyway, he told me why he was annoyed with me.  He had every right to those feelings and 
I wish i could say I handled it well but I didnt.  I started thinkjng about what I do for him and everyone else and basically went into poor me vicitim mode / hulk smash mode. 

This escalated the conflict and there were some hurtful things said. 

So, I came here to vent about him how he is so dismissive of my needs related to my ADHD and I ended up reading someone elses post here that made me realise I was acting just like my malignant NParent and my histronic NParent.  So I apologized to husband for my overreaction and way I handled his critisism.  

I do have ADHD and am also an Aspie, but that doesnt mean that Im not accountable to others for my word and actions.

How do I get rid of these NFleas?

94,Still coming to terms with the realisation my family is toxic,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfae9aa470>,stagnantriver35,0,2,10,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536075375.0,9cwpy5,"I still feel even as I write this that I'm deluded. That I really am a bad person as I've been made to believe and that I've fabricated this whole thing in my head that my parents are narcissistic or at least possess some of the traits.

And yet I can't ignore certain things anymore. I can't ignore how their behaviour matches the traits. How I identify and feel the pain of people in similar situations. I keep rationalising what's happened because it seems too awful, too sick to believe this happened and is still happening. Its like I've found out a dirty little secret. That the people that are meant to love me want to hurt me. That they would take advantage of my nature. 

For years my friends have hated my parents from what I tell them, but I just brushed it off and in my head thought no I deserve this, my friends are just too soft, parents should be hard on their kids and I obviously thought ""of course my friends are going to side with me my version of events could be bias and also they want to make me feel validated"". I was told by my parents that ""Mary's parents think the sun shines out her ass"" whenever they just loved their kid normally. My version of what is normal is skewed. I believed my parents telling me I was all these negative words. If it weren't for my best friend I doubt I'd have realised. She is so bitter towards them for how I've been treated. Whenever she comes to my house my dad acts so fake and weird and she feels uncomfortable because she knows what he's really like. Like I deserve to be slapped, hit, emotionally abused, called stupid most days despite excelling academically, ganged up on, called fat since age 10 when I was not, being chased up the stairs running from someone who's supposedly my dad who's screaming at me ,""IM GOING TO KILL YOU""., told my nose is warped, that I'm socially awkward, will never find a husband, compared to my prettier and more socially conforming friends. grounded for eating a chocolate bar, talked about critically as if I'm not in the room, humiliated in front of my friends/boyfriend, shouted at for other siblings behaviour, my dad walking into my room despite me saying ""I'm getting changed"", being banned from using the computer when I need to do schoolwork, told that I'm such an expense as a child and made to feel guilty. 

I can't stop crying realising the reality of it all. I always wondered what was so wrong with me, what I did to anger and upset them so much. A lifetime of indignant injustice is threatening to overwhelm me. Any advice on where to go from here would be appreciated. One reason I feel like this has happened as the youngest of 4 children is my relaxed nature allows people to walk all over me. I never respond to insults because it seems useless to but I'm now wondering if this has enabled the abusers behaviour. I don't want to turn into them by acting like them."
95,I remember reading books about abuse in the past and not making the connection that I am dealing with abuse myself.,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfacfb7048>,ray390,0,1,1,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536120064.0,9d2ugo,"I remember reading “A Child Called It” (this book in particular was really heart wrenching.  The abuse is quite extreme and made worse by the fact that it really happened), “Chinese Cinderella,” “The Little Princess,” “Matilda,” heck even “Harry Potter” just to name a few.  The abuse laid out in these are quite straightforward, and I remember reading them thinking, “I’d hate to be in their shoes. This is so terrible. These adults treating their child like that is awful. My parents wouldn’t do that.  My parents wouldn’t hurt me. My family is normal.”  It felt like the abuse didn’t apply to me, they were foreign to me. I was convinced my parents loved me and cared about me. 

But it’s like I didn’t see my own messed up situation when I was younger. It’s only now in my 20s that I am starting to see it and I’m just thinking how was I so blind to what was happening.  I never knew I was a victim. I couldn’t see it and even now I have a hard time digesting it and accepting the fact that these people are hurting me and treating me less than I deserve.  Perhaps with personality disorders like narcissism the hallmarks of traditional abuse can sometimes be missing and it’s harder to grasp. 

It’s so weird to think about. Our mind can really play tricks on us trying to deny our own reality. I’ve been reading about I’ll treatment yet can’t see the one I’m dealing with. 

But it’s right in front of my eyes and I still can’t quite grasp it. It’s there! It’s telling me my nparents did nothing to stop it when the GC tried to choke me.  It’s telling me my parents didn’t reprimand him when he physically abused me. The uneven treatment is right in front of my face and I still have a part of me in denial. 

DAE deal with this weird thing where you can’t fully grasp it? Like where you constantly doubt and still have hope that it’s not what it is?"
96,Parents making me feel lost and anxious in college,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb2797a20>,Vanilla_Vaporeon,0,1,0,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536119678.0,9d2t2u,"My life is extremely stressful right now as I am preparing for my senior art show in 2 months. However, its getting a worse recently thanks to my parents (divorced for about 10 years now) making their problems into my own problem. My ndad is trying to be a better and sends me money so I don't have to work while in school. I am very grateful for it. But recently I was forced to move out of my apartment because of a bad roommate. My mom offered for me to move back home with her and my little sister until I graduate this semester, and my dad therefore started giving me less money because he does not want my mom having any of it. 

The problem here is.....  I have only been here at my mom's about 4 months and I think she is already trying to get me to move back out since she is not getting any money from my dad through me.

1) First she started off complaining about my ferrets stinking up the room. They really don't smell bad because I clean their cage often, but I went ahead and bought a nice air purifier so everyone would be happy. She says she likes them now but I feel like she is lying. 

2) Her next complaint was about how I am never home, and not to treat her house like a storage unit. I do stay at my boyfriend's place every weekend, but she agreed before that was totally fine with her since I am an adult and she goes to her boyfriend's place too. Now that they broke up, I feel like she gets all butthurt when I come home after I spend all weekend with my boyfriend, even though I am mostly spending it working hard for my art show anyway.

3) She also keeps regularly asking when me and my boyfriend will ever graduate and get ""real jobs"". She has a habit of bragging about her new life as a nurse and how much money she makes, but then will tell me about how much she hates it the next day and misses being a stay at home mom. Thing is, one day she will praise me for being an artist and wanting to make a living for myself, but the next she feels the need to tell me about how my bf and I won't ever make enough money.

4) Another issue we have is our conflicting opinions about my bf I have been with for 3 years now. She has told me a long time ago that he is not who she would choose for me, and my grandpa once threw a fit about him having long hair and that I should date anyone else but him. We worked it out, and we all get along now (or so I thought). It drives me crazy because now she will say she likes him a lot, but then will test me and make sure we are not wanting to get married. If I even mention my best friend who is getting married soon she is like OMG NO. PLEASE NEVER GET MARRIED. Its really confusing for me. She keeps saying she thinks it would be a good idea for me to move into an apartment with my bf soon, and I agree. We actually lived together a year ago with a friend and it was great, but the rent ended up getting too expensive. But as soon as I tell her I agree, she immediately follows it up with... but it will suck for you when you break up oh and doNT EVER GET MARRIED TO HIM AND DONT EVER HAVE KIDS. I never once have mentioned us getting married or having kids. My bf and I have talked about maybe later in the future we could but... not until we have stable jobs at least. Idk if its because she hates him or she is just being cynical about marriage since she has been divorced many times.

5) She also complains about me eating all her food. I really don't mind going and buying my own groceries, but I get really confused because she has been expecting me and my sister to make dinner sometimes before she comes home. There was one night I was cleaning everyone's dishes, and she started getting on to me, saying how I do nothing and don't contribute to anything in the household. I listened, until it escalated into how she barely has enough child support for my sister since my dad got married to his stupid girlfriend recently and I walked away. But its really not like eat their food all the time. I honestly need to eat better because I am too skinny. I eat breakfast sandwhiches she said I could have but thats about it. I get subway or whatever food I can at school.

6) On a final note, she just now told me she is selling a lot of her expensive furniture to get newer expensive stuff. I said I would take it after I move out when I graduate. But then she said it will be sold before then. So basically I have to move within the next month if I want the furniture. She followed it up by saying she isn't trying to pressure me into moving, but I don't know that I believe that. I then stupidly started stressing out both myself and my bf out about if we should go ahead and move right now. He thought I was mad at him and I feel bad. He can't move right now, but maybe I still could if my dad would give me the amount of money I was getting before again?

I'm not really sure what to do anymore. I'm already stressed out with school, and now its just getting worse with my parents only thinking about themselves... Would moving out as soon as possible be the right thing to do even though I am trying to focus on school? Or should I stay until I graduate and put up with my mom and having less money from my dad? Overall I'm just really lost and I noticed my anxiety I thought I had a grip on a year ago after seeing a therapist is getting worse...

It’s in a different country, and I couldn’t be happier about that. My dad has been telling me how much he’ll miss me and being really nice to me, but now he’s flipped around and wouldn’t even eat dinner with me and my mom because he’s angry that she stood up to her. Why were they fighting? Because my sister said she was coming home to see me off and my dad told her “don’t come home, leave me the fuck alone already.” 

Apparently he considers my mom dropping me off at school to be the first vacation he’s had in years. No kids, no wife, just him and the pets. He flew off the handle when my mom told him it was my sister’s home too and he couldn’t bar her from it. 

This is the newest of several outbursts this summer, but this one really stings because he was being so kind before and it feels like he was just pretending and I fell for his show like an idiot. I just wanted my dad back for a little while before I left. "

Today is my parents anniversary and it is a rather loveless marriage, but my mom is the type of person who gets mad when her children don’t acknowledge the date. I have an older brother and sister. Yesterday my immediate family got together for a simple cookout dinner to for a low key celebration and in the next few days, we’re all going out to eat for a more formal celebration. 

Earlier today, my dad messages me to remind me to wish mom a happy anniversary so I did through text because I’ve been nonstop all day with school and the dialogue went like this:

Me- Happy anniversary 

Mom- Thank you! Do you know how many years

Me- 25 (*i had to think about that for a second*)

Mom- Did you also know that kids are supposed to have a surprise anniversary party for their parents?

I couldn’t even respond to that, I was just so floored. I was not aware that was a thing, and I know it’s all an excuse to make me feel guilty, but at the same time I’m thinking a whirlwind of things. Does she not realize her son just bought a house and is trying to juggle working full time and trying to do necessary repairs to the house while also raising a 3-month-old baby? Does she not realize her older daughter has been home for a month to work on her mental health? Does she not realize I’ve been working my ass off every day so I can have enough money to put myself through grad school that just started today? My mom has expressed to a few people over the last few weeks that her children are disappointments to her. That goes up my ass, but I’m done venting for now. Thanks for hanging around to read this."
