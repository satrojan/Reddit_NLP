We said from the beginning that the most important thing to us was to throw an awesome party. So we focused our money on making sure people would be fed and plied with drinks, that the music would be great, and that we had a venue that would provide a good setting for a party.

I had no bouquet (and thus no bouquet toss). No flowers anywhere at the ceremony site or in the reception venue. We let his mom handle table decorations, which were pretty simple (but pretty!). We had no guest book, and did almost no DIY (basically just favors and name cards) and let the existing venue decorations dominate the setting. We didn't have any reception games (despite this being something heavily expected by his side of the family, as for them weddings are about the entertainment). 

And the end result was that we had a fucking blast, and so many of our friends and family did, too. The reception went from 6 pm to 2 am and it wasn't dull for a single second. In the days since our wedding on Saturday, my favorite thing has been hearing stories about who everyone talked to and what previously non-existant connections were made between people from different parts of our lives (like my parents finally getting to meet my husband's incredible friend circle or my US-based friends finally getting to meet my German-based friends). Our goal for this wedding was to surround ourselves with the people who loved us and whom we loved back, and give them a night to finally meet each other and socialize with us over food, drinks and music. And we achieved this goal a thousand times over.

I'll post a more thorough recap somewhere down the line, but for now, I just want to let those of you who are feeling similarly to how I was: if you don't want to care about things like flowers or centerpieces or making the perfect guest book, or anything else - you don't have to. I skipped so much, and I don't regret a single thing.

I know I might get some flack for this but I have to let it out to someone besides FH and my sister. TL;DR at the bottom.

&#x200B;

For reference we are all late 20's - early/mid 30's aged.

&#x200B;

On Saturday my sister (MOH) threw us a bridal shower. Since neither I nor FH have a ton of female family in the area, we decided to do a co-ed couples shower instead. My sister (and entire family) did an amazing job, everything was so well planned and looked amazing, there was SO much food, it was nice for our families to finally meet our friends and vice versa. I'm so incredibly thankful for everything our families did and have done, we totally felt their support and they were our rock the whole day.

&#x200B;

Our friends, not so much. 

&#x200B;

My sister asked different bridesmaids and groomsmen to bring different things, instead of having everyone chip in monetarily or split the cost of the party. She (IMO) very much undershot what she could have asked people to bring, and instead opted to make it easier on them by having them bring smaller (but still important) items. A card game we all love from one bridesmaid, two bouquets of simple grocery store flowers from another, a case of beer from each of the guys, small amounts of ice. 

&#x200B;

The best man, my FH's best friend in the whole world for almost 10 years, brought a medium-sized (like an 18 pack) case of the absolute cheapest beer you can buy. When we play beer pong we don't even use this beer - I had never drank it before, I never thought it was even on any of our friends' radar. And no we aren't talking Coors or PBR, think Naty Ice or Steele Reserve. He was the first of the groomsmen to arrive so for a while we only had that beer (plus wine and other drinks) for a while, and I was so embarrassed offering those to our other guests as they arrived. 

This happened quite a few times:

""Hey bridalshowersadness, is there beer?""

""Yes! It's in the cooler on the patio!""

""Oh, the \[cheap beer that most of us have never drank before in our lives\]?""  
""Yeah I think that's all there is at the moment, sorry!""

No one said anything about it of course, and I'm thankful that he did help us out by bringing drinks, it's just hard for it not to feel.... passive aggressive? Why now, of all times, bring this worst brand of beer, when he knew that he was going to be meeting some of our family for the first time, he knew this was our once-in-a-lifetime bridal shower not just a random summer potluck, and he had heard how much effort my sis was putting into this? He's brought over larger amounts of better beer for a regular old movie night. He makes good money and has a lot of disposable income so it's not a money issue. And like I said, I wasn't expecting him to bring a keg of the highest percentage craft IPA - even the same amount (although I don't get why you wouldn't bring a 36 pack if you're bringing the cheapest beer....) of Miller Highlife or Budweiser would have been totally fine. 

&#x200B;

There were also TEN no-shows, of people that had been saying how excited they were to go up until a few days before. One friend even messaged me on instagram last Thursday to confirm this was a shower and not just a party. Then he just doesn't show up. So he checked to make sure this is an important life event and not just a Labor Day BBQ, and he still flaked. 

&#x200B;

The worst part, and this is the brattiest part that I feel the worst about being upset over, is that we received three gifts out of almost 30 guests, and one of them was from my mom. Literally none of our bridal party brought a gift or card. I expected a few people to show up without, as a few are more immature for their age, but almost everyone? Numerous of the guests are married, have been married, or have thrown bridal showers themselves. We've given bridal and baby shower gifts for many of them within the past few years. They should have known - they MUST have known? Our registry info was on the invitation, clear as day. We have gifts as low as $3 on our registry. A signed card with no other gift inside would have been great!

&#x200B;

My mom and FMIL really wanted us to open gifts in front of everyone like a traditional shower, and now I'm so, so glad we didn't set time aside from that. That would have been humiliating. 

&#x200B;

I totally understand if you don't believe me, but I swear I am NOT a materialistic person AT ALL. Sure I was excited at the thought of getting new things for our home, but the party itself IS what I was excited for. I actually had an amazing time at the party and wasn't upset at all until after everyone left; my sister told us to open our presents and relax, and there were only three sitting there. Even then I was like ""oh, weird"" and it wasn't until we were driving home that it hit me how little I felt cared for. Sure, the people who love us most showed up for us, celebrated with us, ate and drank. That is nice, it makes my heart happy. But it just feels like we aren't deserving of the same effort and courtesy that other people receive. Like we're more than good enough to plan parties for other people, and give them thoughtful gifts, and be there to listen to all of their problems, and help them move and give them rides. But we aren't good enough to have those people throw us a semi-traditional event before a huge milestone in our lives. 

&#x200B;

These are people we've known for years and years. If it wasn't a BBQ with alcohol, but a more standard ""stuffy"" bridal shower, I wonder if any of them would have even come at all. It's the lack of effort that hurts, not the amount of physical things we can hold. I feel like everyone was excited at the thought of me throwing a party (I used to throw huge, fun themed parties before we moved into a smaller place) and didn't even think about the reason FOR the party.

&#x200B;

Thank you for letting me vent you guys. I really do know that gifts are optional and not a requirement, etc etc etc. I swear I do. I just feel so weird because I can't even vent to my best friends and bridal party about this, so I'm very thankful to have this community. Hopefully you can understand the odd feeling of being so appreciative and so hurt at the same time. It's confusing and shocking and I feel so stupid for even making a registry or for getting so excited for the party. Which then makes me feel terrible cause my sis and family did such a great job. I'll get over this in a few days, but for now it still stings. 

&#x200B;

For the people who were no shows: I'm thinking about calming down a bit more, and then revisiting the wedding guest list in a few weeks. These are people we considered close friends, who all found something better to do this weekend (and no, none of them had emergencies or anything that came up. They posted on instagram while they drank at local restaurants during the shower.) Thoughts?

&#x200B;

TL;DR: We received almost no gifts at our shower and we feel unloved by our guests' lack of effort. Now I'm feeling confused, hurt and embarrassed, and unsure where to go from here.

I'm getting married soon and it's honestly been really fun getting to know his fiance better and being able to bounce ideas off someone. She's wonderful :) So, this isn't about that.

They are the type of couple that are attached at the hip, always together, always having fun. The hashtag was created for them. My fiance and I are are much more independent. We trust and support each other 100% and we give each other a lot of freedom when it comes to event obligations. (You don't want to go to my cousins party? that's cool, I don't really want to go to your uncles housewarming.)

Anyway, my brother and his fiance just looked SO IN LOVE. Also because they are always together the families are super close. My parents and her parents have become friends. It's just so nice. And you could just feel it in the room. And the wedding was PERFECT.

I just felt myself getting kinda jealous. And a little freaked out that I'm not going to be able to help comparing their wedding to ours. Just need some reassurance on the day of none of this will matter :)"

I had met the bride once at a party, never met the groom. My FH went to high school with both, and was good friends with the bride for years. So when she messaged me asking for our address, I was really excited! A few weeks pass and we recieved a STD addressed only to our roomates, A & D, who are also friends with the bride (neither have met the groom either). So we were confused, as the bride specifically reached out to me for our address. We waited for the invited to see what the final decision was. Our roommates again recieved formal invites, and we did not get anything. Three weeks later we get an invite for ""drinks and dancing"" after the reception. So our feelings were hurt because we understood we were the B list. I understand that the bride was in a hard position because we have roommates she wanted to invite too. But I think it would have been more appropriate to reach out to the other couple instead of me for the address. In the end, with bride approval, I went with my roommate A to the ceremony & reception, and my FH and D joined us after for drinks and dancing (they had a prior commiment). 

&#x200B;

Overall, it was a cute wedding. The couple looked very happy, their love was obvious! So more of a breakdown: 

**Ceremony:**

* It was at a casino, so we had to drive a bit to find a parking spot. We also weren't sure what door would be the best to enter so we just guessed and then followed signs once we were inside. 
* Once we found the correct event room, we had no idea what to do. Bridal part were walking in and out, some people were sitting inside, some outside the room. We decided to go get a drink to kill time. Once we got back we talked with a few other friends outside the room. There was a miscommunication as to if drinks were allowed in or not. We were told to finish ours before entering. Yet once we went in, about half the people in there had drinks. Very confusing. 
* The room was a standard event center room. They put up curtains behind them in their bridal colors and some string lights. 
* Chairs were comfortable and spaced well. Didn't feel cramped or too close to the person next to me. 
* The music didn't have the fade out, so noticeable silence as we waited and during the processional. 
* Ceremony was sweet. A lot of puns/metaphors which the couple seemed to enjoy. They had a sand unity ceremony. The vows were the repeat after me, but sounded like they still incorperated their own ideas into. It didn't sound like ones I've heard before. 
* Recieving line was right at the end of the aisle. Ushers dismissed by rows. It look a while because it was a large wedding. Bride told us later that 240 invited. 

**Reception:** 

* After the recieving line, we were ushered into the connected room where the reception was. 
* We didn't know if, or how long, the cocktail hour was. There was no seating chart/table assignments. No signs for what was available at the bar, or cost. Literally no signs. Please have something, as 240 is a large group of people who need directions. Maybe a smaller wedding could have done without. Or have someone announce information. 
* Buffet dinner was good, normal spread of chicken, prime rib, potatoes, salad, and bread rolls. The prime rib had a sauce next to it that didn't have a sign, people were guessing if it was anything from gravy to pudding. Turns out it was a horseraddish sauce. Please have a sign. 
   * Another hiccup - the person responsible for releasing tables for the buffet was late. And then she released us in a strange order. Our table was skipped/missed. We flagged down another worker and he said we should just get in line. Half of our table did, half stayed. The other half tired to join the line a few minutes later and the table-release woman yelled at them to sit back down until released. Once she was far enough away (on the other side of the dance floor) they got up and got in line. We felt bad but every table within 3 rows already had food. We were starving and buzzed. 
* Speeches were lovely, heartfelt, and hilarious. MOH and best man were only bridal party members who gave speeches. MOG and FOB gave quick 30 second thank you speeches. 
* Dances were next - a little delay as the bridal party scattered after speeches. Took a few mins to round them all up again. Dances were cute, the couple sang the song to each other. They laughed and it was very sweet! Father/daughter dance was to the impeial march, it was so cool! 
* They did the dollar dance and then opened up the dance floor for everyone. 
* They did the garter belt, bouquet toss, and something I had never seen before: a literal ball and chain attached to the groom and they auctioned off the key. I don't know if that is a thing, I've never seen it. Maybe a family tradition? 

**Overall:** The wedding was sweet, and you could really tell how excited the bride and groom were to marry each other. My biggest issue was the lack of communication - we didn't know what, where, when anything was. "

41,How to incorporate cultural traditions/music into American wedding?,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb141f208>,mg0714,0,10,11,False,weddingplanning,,1536078925.0,9cxam7,"I‚Äôm so sorry if this is super long. Typed during my break on my phone & my anxiety might have made me ramble a bit. 

I am having trouble incorporating my traditional/cultural ceremony aspects into our wedding. I‚Äôm Bosnian, and my FH is American. Our wedding is going to be pretty standard to an American wedding, in the sense that I will be walking down the aisle, my dad will give me away, and the ceremony will be at our venue not in a mosque (unlike a traditional Bosnian wedding). Neither of us are religious and have already decided to have a friend officiate and keep things neutral there. The issue is, I have no idea how to make a few traditions happen in the way I want it to, and was wondering if anyone else is in a similar situation.
 
We have lived together for 2+ years, and are not doing a registry, or even asking/expecting gifts. This first situation is more so not wanting guests to feel uniformed or like they are not doing something right. In traditional Bosnian weddings, the couple is gifted cash during different times of the event rather than a full amount in a card or something. One tradition is 2 cousins are going to walk around pre-ceremony and pin small boutonnieres on each guest. It is a way to make each guest feel like an important part of the celebration. One holds a basket of the boutonnieres, and one holds and empty basket. As one pins the boutonniere, it is expected that the guest put a small amount of cash in the other basket. There are many other moments like this in a Bosnian wedding, but this is the only one we are doing/makes sense with our actual wedding. My Bosnian wedding guests will know this, but I don‚Äôt want my other guests to see this and feel awkward/obligated, but I also don‚Äôt want them to feel like they missed out on a tradition because they didn‚Äôt know.
 
The next is music: Music is SUPER important to my side of the family (Bosnian music). My FH suggested having an American DJ, and a Bosnian musician/singer alternate during the reception. Has anyone ever done this before? I worry about the logistics of things a lot. Also, there is a traditional Bosnian dance that I would love my guests (who are comfortable) participate in. How can I inform my guests of the music/dancing situation beforehand? 

Do I even need to? I really want my friends to get a feel for my culture and traditions without making it too confusing.

We didn't really do anything to celebrate apart from buy take out. My parents came over with cake and for a cuppa the weekend after and that was it.

We'll probably have about 70 guests (no kids), and will be in an indoor space for the reception.

I‚Äôm feeling overwhelmed about what I should have / need to have done by now for June 2019 to become a reality.

I contacted a wedding planner and was told that once I decide on the location & resort, guests will have 30 days to put a deposit down to guarantee their travel rates and it sounds like to also ensure we have 10 rooms (btw I‚Äôm not sure what the consequences would be if we don‚Äôt have 10 rooms confirmed in advance).

1. 30 days just seems like a really quick window and doesn‚Äôt leave time for formal invitations - is this normal, do most people just send email invites for destination weddings?

2. It feels like a pretty big expectation to put on people to commit to coming to a wedding 9 months away and to firmly do so with a deposit in a 30 day window.

My super amazing fiance is from Italy.  We live in the UK.  There is literally no way for us to not have a wedding that's a destination wedding for some guests.

First, some gushing.

We both want something small and casual and he's dreamed of getting married at the lovely old stone farmhouse where he grew up in the hills of Tuscany.  Amazing, I'm 100% down.  He wants it to be at the end of June when the cherry trees are fruiting and the hills are covered in wildflowers.  We'll pick flowers and small cherry branches to decorate the tables (his ideas, fiance of the year award to him). Since he is technically the owner of that house, it looks like we may be able to have the ceremony in this ridiculously beautiful castle for free.  Just WHAT.

https://i.redd.it/c1bcqsva28k11.jpg

He told me that he wanted his family friend who works in the local village to cater the wedding. The friend agreed, saying that my fiance is basically family.  Yes!  Local, casual, lovely.  But turns out he's weirdly famous.  Catered for royalty and rockstars.  Yet this doesn't feel like it lost the feel that we wanted; it's still intimate, personal, and sweetly romantic.  I don't even understand how this is my life.

‚Äã

But now groaning:

40 people, 20 for each of us, is small.  It's what we want, but the moment people hear ""Tuscany"" they say, ""Oh that sounds great!  When is it so I can start planning my trip?""  People assuming that they're invited to a wedding is pretty frustrating, but it's especially hard since I want them all there, but space and finances say otherwise.  And then there's the politics.  I can't invite really close friend A without friends B and C feeling left out, and they need plus ones so if I invite friend A, that is now 30% of my invites gone.  I have one aunt and uncle who have done the world for me and the rest, not so much.  But can't invite one set without the others.

How did others with small weddings deal with choosing people to come with all of these political issues?  Did you leave out key people just to have consistent rules?"

1. Our engagement photos are scheduled for late October in a forest.

2. Fashion choices are hard for me.

Here's the sitch. FH and I are really casual usually. I'm a leather jacket, combat boots and flannel kind of girl usually. I like the idea of getting photos done that are very ""us"". Relaxed. Comfortable. Cozy.

I'm also pagan, so we intended to do a self-led handfasting during our engagement photos as a betrothal ceremony. We like the idea of having some really nice photos of this intimate moment that's literally almost a year and a day from our real wedding date (which is significant in terms of Celtic pagan tradition). However, I felt weird about doing such an important ceremony in our super casual clothes. 

So, I was considering bringing a second outfit. One that's more formal. Like a beautiful flowy, maxi dress in burgundy or hunter green or something with heels. But the thought of searching for a special dress is stressing me out. I'm not great with shopping. I get overwhelmed super easily and just wish I could get the Fab Five from Queer Eye to dress me up so I don't have to worry about whether or not my fashion sense is whack. 

I don't know, guys. I'm freaking out a little internally. 

**Question 1: Should I even feel weird about doing the ceremony in casual clothes?**

But FH and I are both pretty turned off by the standard kitschy photo booth props. They feel played out and those kinds of pictures aren't really our thing. We could maybe come up with a few fun props that suit our wedding vibes (like flower crowns or giant paper flowers since the wedding is at a wildflower center, maybe some paper cutouts of our cats) but we really don't want the usual over-sized glasses, costume hats, and feather boas.

I really struggled to find a dress I loved, and after trying tons of dresses on, I was really dissatisfied. There were elements from one gown I liked, and elements from another, but no ""one dress"" that combined all into one.

I found a company called Anomalie, which is relatively new out of San Francisco, and opted to give them a try.

They custom build your wedding dress from scratch, design it themselves, send you fabric samples for you to feel/test/approve, then send you production updates of your dress every step of the way, giving you time to comment on the dress and make critiques/changes. From the basic construction of the silhouette, to the exact placement of the lace, I had a ton of say in how this dress turned out.

I'm a real bride, they don't even know I'm doing this lol - I hope it's ok that I use their images.

**Basics:**

* About 6 weeks from start to finish for the dress - but mine took longer due to personal things and being unable to get back to them within a reasonable timeframe.
* $1400 for the dress itself; they quoted me ahead of time. Expensive, but less expensive than a $3000 one I had been pining after.
* If you don't like the dress -YOU CAN RETURN IT FOR THE FULL PRICE!! This policy was what motivated me to take a risk and give them a shot!

**Steps of the process:**

1. I sent them a ton of photos of inspiration for the dress, then hopped on a phone call with a representative talking about specifics to make sure there was a lot of clarity with regards to vision. They make notes in your file.
2. They take about a week and send you a sketch of your dress. Once you get the sketch, you either approve it or make edits - for example, I wanted my neckline a little bit lower than in their original sketch.
3. Next, you get measurements from a local seamstress and send it to them. They have seamstresses that are approved in many cities throughout the country.
4. You get a box in the mail of the fabrics or lace they recommend, so you can feel and approve them yourself. This step was super fun and exciting, and I was impressed by the quality of the materials
5. Once there is a fabric approval, they do a ""test dress"" (don't know the terms sorry fam) in a cheap fabric, so you can approve the overall silhouette. They messed up with me a bit in this part, because I told them I wanted the skirt less voluminous, and I didn't get a follow up image with the changes (which had repercussions down the line which I'll talk about below).
6. Then they move on to making the ""final"" dress, sew together the base fabrics according to your measurements.
7. Next is lace/embellishment placement! They lightly pin the lace according to the design, then send you the photo for your final approval - you let them know what changes you want, before they make the final step of sewing it all together.
8. Then - they sew the whole thing together and send it to you!

**The Good:**

* The quality is gorgeous in person
* It's really nuts to have a dress made perfectly to your measurements - I've never experienced that before, and it fit like a glove out of the box. They mention that's not a normal part of the process, that most people¬†*do*¬†require alterations after the fact, but it was still very impressive and super cool.
* The whole company is just awesome. I was a pain in the ass at times I'm sure, and they were nothing but peaches and cream. I sent them a lot of photoshop composites of what I was hoping for for the sake of clarity, and they were really good about noting every last thing, and it was clear they were willing to bend over backwards to make me happy.
* You get to design a dress from scratch, and if you don't like it you get to return it! That policy really gave me peace of mind, so worst comes to worst you're not stuck with a dress that just didn't work out.
* They were super easy to work with and VERY responsive, which makes such a nerve-wrecking process a whole lot easier.

**The Needs-some-work-on-their-part:**

* I could have used follow up steps after the silhouette test phase. As I said above, they made the skirt too big for my taste. I had asked them to take the skirt in a bit more, and I think they just¬†*told*¬†me they would make changes, but then sent me photos of the mannequin slightly raised up so the skirt looked more narrow/wasn't brushing the floor and fanning out. Fortunately, I can fix it with a seamstress I'm pretty sure, and take the skirt in a bit.
* The skirt fabric: they made a small mistake here too. They suggested a specific fabric at the beginning of the construction phase (plastic mesh), and I didn't like the sheen it had as a fabric, so I requested double-faced tulle; it's more transparent and matte. I had spoken to the technician, and she approved this and said it would be possible, and they would make a note.Weelllllllll I open up the dress, and it's the plastic mesh material. Thankfully, it's transparent enough and really still looks very lovely, so I am not letting myself get too bothered by it.
* I should note - there are a¬†*million*¬†other small details they got right. They did perfect boning on the dress, the lace placement is perfection, the silhouette is perfect, the overall materials are really high quality. So I'm not getting too worked up about the above.

**Conclusion:**

Working with Anomalie was one of the best choices I've made so far in my wedding. The dress itself is a real dream, it fits perfectly, it's flattering, and they worked so hard to make sure I was happy. I really wish the company success, I can't believe I get to wear my exact dream dress on my wedding day. If you choose to work with them, I would make a list of the most important things you want in your gown, and reiterate them each step of the way, so certain details don't get lost in the process.

Anyway¬†[r/weddingplanning](https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning)¬†\- I hope this is helpful!

Edited to add: I realized I can upload a short gif of the dress itself in the body of this post. Sorry I'm talking in it, this was sent to friends and family, specifying how much fabric I plan t get removed from the skirt.
