We said from the beginning that the most important thing to us was to throw an awesome party. So we focused our money on making sure people would be fed and plied with drinks, that the music would be great, and that we had a venue that would provide a good setting for a party.

I had no bouquet (and thus no bouquet toss). No flowers anywhere at the ceremony site or in the reception venue. We let his mom handle table decorations, which were pretty simple (but pretty!). We had no guest book, and did almost no DIY (basically just favors and name cards) and let the existing venue decorations dominate the setting. We didn't have any reception games (despite this being something heavily expected by his side of the family, as for them weddings are about the entertainment). 

And the end result was that we had a fucking blast, and so many of our friends and family did, too. The reception went from 6 pm to 2 am and it wasn't dull for a single second. In the days since our wedding on Saturday, my favorite thing has been hearing stories about who everyone talked to and what previously non-existant connections were made between people from different parts of our lives (like my parents finally getting to meet my husband's incredible friend circle or my US-based friends finally getting to meet my German-based friends). Our goal for this wedding was to surround ourselves with the people who loved us and whom we loved back, and give them a night to finally meet each other and socialize with us over food, drinks and music. And we achieved this goal a thousand times over.

I'll post a more thorough recap somewhere down the line, but for now, I just want to let those of you who are feeling similarly to how I was: if you don't want to care about things like flowers or centerpieces or making the perfect guest book, or anything else - you don't have to. I skipped so much, and I don't regret a single thing.

Anyway here's a bonus picture of us with an alpaca we ran into at the zoo where we held our ceremony: http://imgur.com/En8jplx"

I happily paid assuming that the cost covered the price of the rental. The bride also mentioned that she and the groom would be providing alcohol, snacks, and transportation. Great! Sounds reasonable.

Well, shortly thereafter, we come to find out that the houses were a gift, and provided to the couple free of charge. Which basically means that the bridal party is covering all of the alcohol, snacks, and transportation, and also providing an enormous amount of extra money to the bride and groom. Without our consent or knowledge. 

I am so hurt and upset that after spending so much time and effort and money into hosting an engagement party, bridal shower, and bachelorette party, I'm also now covering expenses that I never agreed to because the free house was kept secret.

I know I might get some flack for this but I have to let it out to someone besides FH and my sister. TL;DR at the bottom.

&#x200B;

For reference we are all late 20's - early/mid 30's aged.

&#x200B;

On Saturday my sister (MOH) threw us a bridal shower. Since neither I nor FH have a ton of female family in the area, we decided to do a co-ed couples shower instead. My sister (and entire family) did an amazing job, everything was so well planned and looked amazing, there was SO much food, it was nice for our families to finally meet our friends and vice versa. I'm so incredibly thankful for everything our families did and have done, we totally felt their support and they were our rock the whole day.

&#x200B;

Our friends, not so much. 

&#x200B;

My sister asked different bridesmaids and groomsmen to bring different things, instead of having everyone chip in monetarily or split the cost of the party. She (IMO) very much undershot what she could have asked people to bring, and instead opted to make it easier on them by having them bring smaller (but still important) items. A card game we all love from one bridesmaid, two bouquets of simple grocery store flowers from another, a case of beer from each of the guys, small amounts of ice. 

&#x200B;

The best man, my FH's best friend in the whole world for almost 10 years, brought a medium-sized (like an 18 pack) case of the absolute cheapest beer you can buy. When we play beer pong we don't even use this beer - I had never drank it before, I never thought it was even on any of our friends' radar. And no we aren't talking Coors or PBR, think Naty Ice or Steele Reserve. He was the first of the groomsmen to arrive so for a while we only had that beer (plus wine and other drinks) for a while, and I was so embarrassed offering those to our other guests as they arrived. 

This happened quite a few times:

""Hey bridalshowersadness, is there beer?""

""Yes! It's in the cooler on the patio!""

""Oh, the \[cheap beer that most of us have never drank before in our lives\]?""  
""Yeah I think that's all there is at the moment, sorry!""

No one said anything about it of course, and I'm thankful that he did help us out by bringing drinks, it's just hard for it not to feel.... passive aggressive? Why now, of all times, bring this worst brand of beer, when he knew that he was going to be meeting some of our family for the first time, he knew this was our once-in-a-lifetime bridal shower not just a random summer potluck, and he had heard how much effort my sis was putting into this? He's brought over larger amounts of better beer for a regular old movie night. He makes good money and has a lot of disposable income so it's not a money issue. And like I said, I wasn't expecting him to bring a keg of the highest percentage craft IPA - even the same amount (although I don't get why you wouldn't bring a 36 pack if you're bringing the cheapest beer....) of Miller Highlife or Budweiser would have been totally fine. 

&#x200B;

There were also TEN no-shows, of people that had been saying how excited they were to go up until a few days before. One friend even messaged me on instagram last Thursday to confirm this was a shower and not just a party. Then he just doesn't show up. So he checked to make sure this is an important life event and not just a Labor Day BBQ, and he still flaked. 

&#x200B;

The worst part, and this is the brattiest part that I feel the worst about being upset over, is that we received three gifts out of almost 30 guests, and one of them was from my mom. Literally none of our bridal party brought a gift or card. I expected a few people to show up without, as a few are more immature for their age, but almost everyone? Numerous of the guests are married, have been married, or have thrown bridal showers themselves. We've given bridal and baby shower gifts for many of them within the past few years. They should have known - they MUST have known? Our registry info was on the invitation, clear as day. We have gifts as low as $3 on our registry. A signed card with no other gift inside would have been great!

&#x200B;

My mom and FMIL really wanted us to open gifts in front of everyone like a traditional shower, and now I'm so, so glad we didn't set time aside from that. That would have been humiliating. 

&#x200B;

I totally understand if you don't believe me, but I swear I am NOT a materialistic person AT ALL. Sure I was excited at the thought of getting new things for our home, but the party itself IS what I was excited for. I actually had an amazing time at the party and wasn't upset at all until after everyone left; my sister told us to open our presents and relax, and there were only three sitting there. Even then I was like ""oh, weird"" and it wasn't until we were driving home that it hit me how little I felt cared for. Sure, the people who love us most showed up for us, celebrated with us, ate and drank. That is nice, it makes my heart happy. But it just feels like we aren't deserving of the same effort and courtesy that other people receive. Like we're more than good enough to plan parties for other people, and give them thoughtful gifts, and be there to listen to all of their problems, and help them move and give them rides. But we aren't good enough to have those people throw us a semi-traditional event before a huge milestone in our lives. 

&#x200B;

These are people we've known for years and years. If it wasn't a BBQ with alcohol, but a more standard ""stuffy"" bridal shower, I wonder if any of them would have even come at all. It's the lack of effort that hurts, not the amount of physical things we can hold. I feel like everyone was excited at the thought of me throwing a party (I used to throw huge, fun themed parties before we moved into a smaller place) and didn't even think about the reason FOR the party.

&#x200B;

Thank you for letting me vent you guys. I really do know that gifts are optional and not a requirement, etc etc etc. I swear I do. I just feel so weird because I can't even vent to my best friends and bridal party about this, so I'm very thankful to have this community. Hopefully you can understand the odd feeling of being so appreciative and so hurt at the same time. It's confusing and shocking and I feel so stupid for even making a registry or for getting so excited for the party. Which then makes me feel terrible cause my sis and family did such a great job. I'll get over this in a few days, but for now it still stings. 

&#x200B;

For the people who were no shows: I'm thinking about calming down a bit more, and then revisiting the wedding guest list in a few weeks. These are people we considered close friends, who all found something better to do this weekend (and no, none of them had emergencies or anything that came up. They posted on instagram while they drank at local restaurants during the shower.) Thoughts?

&#x200B;

TL;DR: We received almost no gifts at our shower and we feel unloved by our guests' lack of effort. Now I'm feeling confused, hurt and embarrassed, and unsure where to go from here.

I had met the bride once at a party, never met the groom. My FH went to high school with both, and was good friends with the bride for years. So when she messaged me asking for our address, I was really excited! A few weeks pass and we recieved a STD addressed only to our roomates, A & D, who are also friends with the bride (neither have met the groom either). So we were confused, as the bride specifically reached out to me for our address. We waited for the invited to see what the final decision was. Our roommates again recieved formal invites, and we did not get anything. Three weeks later we get an invite for ""drinks and dancing"" after the reception. So our feelings were hurt because we understood we were the B list. I understand that the bride was in a hard position because we have roommates she wanted to invite too. But I think it would have been more appropriate to reach out to the other couple instead of me for the address. In the end, with bride approval, I went with my roommate A to the ceremony & reception, and my FH and D joined us after for drinks and dancing (they had a prior commiment). 

&#x200B;

Overall, it was a cute wedding. The couple looked very happy, their love was obvious! So more of a breakdown: 

**Ceremony:**

* It was at a casino, so we had to drive a bit to find a parking spot. We also weren't sure what door would be the best to enter so we just guessed and then followed signs once we were inside. 
* Once we found the correct event room, we had no idea what to do. Bridal part were walking in and out, some people were sitting inside, some outside the room. We decided to go get a drink to kill time. Once we got back we talked with a few other friends outside the room. There was a miscommunication as to if drinks were allowed in or not. We were told to finish ours before entering. Yet once we went in, about half the people in there had drinks. Very confusing. 
* The room was a standard event center room. They put up curtains behind them in their bridal colors and some string lights. 
* Chairs were comfortable and spaced well. Didn't feel cramped or too close to the person next to me. 
* The music didn't have the fade out, so noticeable silence as we waited and during the processional. 
* Ceremony was sweet. A lot of puns/metaphors which the couple seemed to enjoy. They had a sand unity ceremony. The vows were the repeat after me, but sounded like they still incorperated their own ideas into. It didn't sound like ones I've heard before. 
* Recieving line was right at the end of the aisle. Ushers dismissed by rows. It look a while because it was a large wedding. Bride told us later that 240 invited. 

**Reception:** 

* After the recieving line, we were ushered into the connected room where the reception was. 
* We didn't know if, or how long, the cocktail hour was. There was no seating chart/table assignments. No signs for what was available at the bar, or cost. Literally no signs. Please have something, as 240 is a large group of people who need directions. Maybe a smaller wedding could have done without. Or have someone announce information. 
* Buffet dinner was good, normal spread of chicken, prime rib, potatoes, salad, and bread rolls. The prime rib had a sauce next to it that didn't have a sign, people were guessing if it was anything from gravy to pudding. Turns out it was a horseraddish sauce. Please have a sign. 
   * Another hiccup - the person responsible for releasing tables for the buffet was late. And then she released us in a strange order. Our table was skipped/missed. We flagged down another worker and he said we should just get in line. Half of our table did, half stayed. The other half tired to join the line a few minutes later and the table-release woman yelled at them to sit back down until released. Once she was far enough away (on the other side of the dance floor) they got up and got in line. We felt bad but every table within 3 rows already had food. We were starving and buzzed. 
* Speeches were lovely, heartfelt, and hilarious. MOH and best man were only bridal party members who gave speeches. MOG and FOB gave quick 30 second thank you speeches. 
* Dances were next - a little delay as the bridal party scattered after speeches. Took a few mins to round them all up again. Dances were cute, the couple sang the song to each other. They laughed and it was very sweet! Father/daughter dance was to the impeial march, it was so cool! 
* They did the dollar dance and then opened up the dance floor for everyone. 
* They did the garter belt, bouquet toss, and something I had never seen before: a literal ball and chain attached to the groom and they auctioned off the key. I don't know if that is a thing, I've never seen it. Maybe a family tradition? 

**Overall:** The wedding was sweet, and you could really tell how excited the bride and groom were to marry each other. My biggest issue was the lack of communication - we didn't know what, where, when anything was. "

They are the type of couple that are attached at the hip, always together, always having fun. The hashtag was created for them. My fiance and I are are much more independent. We trust and support each other 100% and we give each other a lot of freedom when it comes to event obligations. (You don't want to go to my cousins party? that's cool, I don't really want to go to your uncles housewarming.)

Anyway, my brother and his fiance just looked SO IN LOVE. Also because they are always together the families are super close. My parents and her parents have become friends. It's just so nice. And you could just feel it in the room. And the wedding was PERFECT.

I just felt myself getting kinda jealous. And a little freaked out that I'm not going to be able to help comparing their wedding to ours. Just need some reassurance on the day of none of this will matter :)"

Is there a polite way to do this? The last thing I want is for it to feel like a money grab. Perhaps if the invite came from my parents and included something that said ""no gifts""?

Is there a way to do this that might let people know that we can't invite them to the wedding, but it's still important that thy can celebrate with us in any way? I would hate to have to converse with someone asking me when their invite will come when they aren't on the guest list.

Has/did your boyfriend/fiance/husband consider changing his last name? Did he end up doing it, or did he just consider it and ultimately decide not to? Whether it's taking your last name, hyphenating, or combining or making a new last name for for the two of you. Or was he completely opposed to changing his name at all?

It seems like it‚Äôll be the most awkward situation. 

A little back story...this person has been one of my really good friends for the last 10 years, but unfortunately has struggled with alcoholism the last few years. She‚Äôs done multiple trips to rehabs and continues to relapse. When I asked her to be a bridesmaid, she had recently gotten out of rehab and actually seemed like she was going to be sober this time around and actually wanted to be. 

Fast forward 3 months later and I set up my first dress appointment. She said she was going to come to the appointment, but never shows up. I text her afterwards and she claims she forgot she had to pick up a family member at the airport. I thought this was a little weird that she wouldn‚Äôt have just texted me that she couldn‚Äôt make it anymore, but I overlooked it. 

Two weeks later, I schedule 2 more dress appointments on the same day. She was supposedly coming to both, but I didn‚Äôt expect much. She texted me right before the first one saying she had a surprise birthday lunch, but would be at the second one. She shows up late to the second appointment and is hammered. Hair and makeup all disheveled, she immediately starts crying to another bridesmaid that her and her boyfriend broke up. Then for the whole appointment, she sat in the corner and didn‚Äôt say a word. When we go to leave, I go up to her car and it wreaks of alcohol. I can‚Äôt even believe she drove that far in that condition. She can barely even talk to say bye. 

Now I‚Äôm at the point where I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a good idea for her to be a bridesmaid. But how do you ask someone to step down without ruining a friendship? I brought up her being drunk at the appointment and she swore to me it was a one time relapse and she thought she could have a drink for her birthday. I don‚Äôt honestly believe this because I know how addicts lie. 

I‚Äôm just looking for any advice or if anyone else has had to do this before. Thanks in advance!

TL;DR - one of my bridesmaids is a struggling alcoholic and I think I need to ask her to step down, but don‚Äôt know how. "

Similarly, the rehearsal dinner invitation will only have their names as they are the hosts. Is this correct etiquette?

The deadline to RSVP was Aug 15. On Sunday, they RSVP'd for their young child to attend as well. The invite was addressed to the couple only (Mr. & Mrs. X). We did online RSVPs and I guess I should have disabled that option after the deadline, but it didn't occur to me that anyone would try to do this (I guess lesson learned for anyone reading this). I only noticed it today when I checked my email and saw the reservation notification.

The only children we invited to our wedding are my brother's, because he and his wife are traveling from out of town and have two very young children they don't want to leave behind. (This couple lives in the same town as the wedding, if it matters.) No other guests are bringing children. It will not be a particularly child-friendly event (lots of alcohol and lots of wild dancing is the vibe we're going for). 

I've known this couple for a very long time and they are wonderful people. I'm so shocked that they would do something so rude (or not know that what they did is rude?) and I'm now really upset that I'm going to have to make a super awkward phone call to tell them that their child can't come. I'm worried that this could damage my relationship with these people, but I did not budget or plan for their child to attend. On the other hand, I feel like maybe I'm over-reacting due to wedding stress, because I'm so upset by this and maybe I shouldn't be. 

Am I over-reacting? Has anyone had to handle a similar situation? How did it go? "

Typed during my break on my phone & my anxiety might have made me ramble a bit. 

I am having trouble incorporating my traditional/cultural ceremony aspects into our wedding. I‚Äôm Bosnian, and my FH is American. Our wedding is going to be pretty standard to an American wedding, in the sense that I will be walking down the aisle, my dad will give me away, and the ceremony will be at our venue not in a mosque (unlike a traditional Bosnian wedding). Neither of us are religious and have already decided to have a friend officiate and keep things neutral there. The issue is, I have no idea how to make a few traditions happen in the way I want it to, and was wondering if anyone else is in a similar situation.
 
We have lived together for 2+ years, and are not doing a registry, or even asking/expecting gifts. This first situation is more so not wanting guests to feel uniformed or like they are not doing something right. In traditional Bosnian weddings, the couple is gifted cash during different times of the event rather than a full amount in a card or something. One tradition is 2 cousins are going to walk around pre-ceremony and pin small boutonnieres on each guest. It is a way to make each guest feel like an important part of the celebration. One holds a basket of the boutonnieres, and one holds and empty basket. As one pins the boutonniere, it is expected that the guest put a small amount of cash in the other basket. There are many other moments like this in a Bosnian wedding, but this is the only one we are doing/makes sense with our actual wedding. My Bosnian wedding guests will know this, but I don‚Äôt want my other guests to see this and feel awkward/obligated, but I also don‚Äôt want them to feel like they missed out on a tradition because they didn‚Äôt know.
 
The next is music: Music is SUPER important to my side of the family (Bosnian music). My FH suggested having an American DJ, and a Bosnian musician/singer alternate during the reception. Has anyone ever done this before? I worry about the logistics of things a lot. Also, there is a traditional Bosnian dance that I would love my guests (who are comfortable) participate in. How can I inform my guests of the music/dancing situation beforehand? 

Do I even need to? I really want my friends to get a feel for my culture and traditions without making it too confusing.

We'll probably have about 70 guests (no kids), and will be in an indoor space for the reception. If we do this, I plan to have a sign by the games asking people not to have food or drink while using the games, and to please be careful to not lose or damage parts, but accidents do happen. Any ideas on how to implement this while ensuring the ""safety"" of our board games? Are there board game rental services that I don't know about?

1. Our engagement photos are scheduled for late October in a forest.

2. Fashion choices are hard for me.

Here's the sitch. FH and I are really casual usually. I'm a leather jacket, combat boots and flannel kind of girl usually. I like the idea of getting photos done that are very ""us"". Relaxed. Comfortable. Cozy.

I'm also pagan, so we intended to do a self-led handfasting during our engagement photos as a betrothal ceremony. We like the idea of having some really nice photos of this intimate moment that's literally almost a year and a day from our real wedding date (which is significant in terms of Celtic pagan tradition). However, I felt weird about doing such an important ceremony in our super casual clothes. 

So, I was considering bringing a second outfit. One that's more formal. Like a beautiful flowy, maxi dress in burgundy or hunter green or something with heels. But the thought of searching for a special dress is stressing me out. I'm not great with shopping. I get overwhelmed super easily and just wish I could get the Fab Five from Queer Eye to dress me up so I don't have to worry about whether or not my fashion sense is whack. 

I don't know, guys. I'm freaking out a little internally. 

**Question 1: Should I even feel weird about doing the ceremony in casual clothes?**

**Question 2: Where do you guys go to shop for and try on pretty dresses?**

**Question 3: I have bright red hair and grey eyes. Which colors should I avoid?**"

Getting married on a Wednesday (date significance), no bridal party--his Uncle is marrying us @ 5:30pm. Getting married at an Italian restaurant before having a dinner and then playing games (NO DJ). Below is the ""Day of"" Timeline I've kind of come up with. The makeup and hair people are asking for times, and I'm unsure on when to tell them to be here (they're traveling)? Can I move the hair/makeup later do you think? What needs to be tweaked?

&#x200B;

10am-Hair (I have thick hair...doing a braid. Hair will be dry when she starts work)

11:30am-Makeup

12:30pm-Lunch

2:00pm-Finish getting ready

3:30pm-5:00pm-Pictures (off-site, some on-site...may be making 2 off-site stops)

5:00-5:30pm-Greet guests as they arrive (maybe...not sure about this time)

5:30-6:00pm-Ceremony

6:00pm-7:00pm-Some family photos out front, more B&G shots outside; Cocktail Hour

7:00pm-Cake cutting, then dinner

8:00pm-Dessert (cake & sundae bar) & playing games!

10:00pm-End of rental time

My tentative plan is:

1. My mom and I go and don't tell anyone. This is just to determine style and fit. We will not be actively looking for ""the dress.""
2. We go again with MIL and bridesmaids and try on dresses that fit with what I liked the first time. We hope to find ""the dress.""

I‚Äôm hoping to plan a destination wedding for June 2019. I‚Äôm getting very anxious about timing. I‚Äôm feeling overwhelmed about what I should have / need to have done by now for June 2019 to become a reality.

I contacted a wedding planner and was told that once I decide on the location & resort, guests will have 30 days to put a deposit down to guarantee their travel rates and it sounds like to also ensure we have 10 rooms (btw I‚Äôm not sure what the consequences would be if we don‚Äôt have 10 rooms confirmed in advance). This leaves me with two initial concerns:

1. 30 days just seems like a really quick window and doesn‚Äôt leave time for formal invitations - is this normal, do most people just send email invites for destination weddings?

2. It feels like a pretty big expectation to put on people to commit to coming to a wedding 9 months away and to firmly do so with a deposit in a 30 day window.

I hate planning and this stuff is really overwhelming for me. I don‚Äôt want to be a burden on possible guests. I just want this to be easy for everyone involved (myself included). Please tell me what you‚Äôve all done or seen regarding invitations and ‚ÄúRSVP expectations‚Äù for destination weddings..."

My fiance would like to pay for his ticket, and I used to be okay with it, but unfortunate things happened with both our work and we end up not being able to afford paying for his ticket, we still have at least 8 grand balance for our wedding. 
We are having a fight over this. I obviously dont want to pay for his friend's ticket. I feel like if he wanted to be at his best friend's wedding he could've saved some for it..mind you, my fiance is already paying half of his ticket using his credit card points.

We want to use it as our main line of communication to everyone who's involved in the wedding and all guests. We will literally be sending a URL and surprise people! But how do you gather people's emails without telling them first what it's for. 

Also on that note, how do you pop bridal party questions? Do you talk to them face to face regarding the wedding and then surprise them with the ""will you be my bridesmaid/groomsmen"" question? Or just send a card asking the question? I won't be doing any wedding favors so I will not be sending them anything when I ask them either. I'm also not asking them to do anything for me except show up to the wedding, look cute, and have fun. Im also buying their dresses and paying for hair and make up. Is it ok to just call them up and ask over the phone? I don't want to put people on the spot either. But I am close to my potential bridesmaids. I'm completely ok with them saying no to me. I just don't want then to feel uncomfortable.

That's fine. 

How many \*edited\* photos versus ostensibly \*not edited\* (or I suppose quickly touched up) photos should you expect? Or should you generally expect everything you get back to have the rock star treatment?
