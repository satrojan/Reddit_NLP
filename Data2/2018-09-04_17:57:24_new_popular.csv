I'm not sure there will a 3rd, but if there is it will be in Yellowstone Park proper on or near the Madison River. 

I wanted to believe in New Mexico due to easier BOTG, but big picture, I just don't see it any longer. Fenn's sacred place is in Yellowstone, otherwise his books, videos and pronouncements all have been seriously off the mark. 

Even limited to Yellowstone, the odds of finding a 10""x10""x6"" box are incredibly small given a set of instructions that happily mate to almost anywhere.

Good luck to those still in the hunt.

I have 3-4 semesters left until I graduate.
Right now I have ZERO experience/work in IT.
The only little programming I’ve learned is using HTML, PHP, & CSS.


Whenever I get advice from people they tell me getting an internship is a must have.. any further advice on the types of places to apply to?


I’m trying to get work in the meantime doing something like help desk work or something related to my degree. I’ve read working for Geeksquad could actually make a difference.


I also don’t have much of an idea of what I’d like to focus on / get a job doing once I’m graduated... I’m pretty much a blank slate at this point. I’ve been told I’m a pretty good people person, but I understand I gotta learn some basics of coding and how IT works.
I know there are things like data security, networks... THE BIG THING I hear is getting into Data Analytics.

With that being said I think business consulting is something I’d like.


Other questions I have are about anything I should know in particular to show off on my resume. So far I’ve been told:

SQL
Blockchain 


I would greatly appreciate any advice on things I should learn, routes I can take!
Even articles / books / newspapers I should read to help me understand the world of IT would be awesome."

Show it the world, let it sin and stain

Until it becomes static

A head on the shoulders

Of age

Pain

Fearful living and failure of oblivion

It is so easy to remember the sweet

Drowning of the mind

The quiet

Now the volume is a solitary mute

You changed

I did not change

You grew

I grew stunted

And looking into your eyes, I see the climate change

Further away from you

My bruises show

My

Allegiance to the static"

The leaves seem to be just falling off.  I have them in a humidity dome.  I am using the same soil medium that all of my plants are growing in.  I took cuttings at 45' angle, dipped them in aloe, soaked the medium and planted.  Any tips?

Round 1:

* Kung Pao (still alive?)
* Ghost (dead)
* Reaper (dead)
* Habanero (dead)
* Heat mat underneath, was not checking ambient temperature but I guess around 85-90' F
* Humidity dome ventilated, average humidity probably around 60-80%
* Sliced vertical slit about 1/2-1"" up bottom of stem

Round 2:

* Reaper (dead)
* Reaper (dead)
* Reaper (still alive?)
* No heat mat underneath, thought it was getting too hot. Average temperature 78' F
* Humidity dome completely sealed, typically 100% humidity
* Scraped the outside of the bottom of each stem

Hardly any rain with races and not many safety cars. But my luck and my teams luck in the second season is awful. 

China (one of my best tracks) qualified 1st. Les for 10 laps. Even though everyone pitted I stayed out because it kept saying it was going to rain. It didn’t. I then had to pit. The lap I came out the pits in. It started raining. Ended up finishing 5th. 

Spain. Qualified 2nd. Me and Vettel has an awesome start for Ferrari. He then gets a engine failure on lap 4. I then pit a few laps later and when I come out there is a safety car. End up finishing 4th. 

Monaco. Ferrari 1 and 2. Me 2nd. First Corning I get taken out by bottas ( I don’t use flashbacks). 

Canada ( my favourite ever track) I qualify first. Ferrari 1 and 3. Worst start ever. Drop to 5th. I then put early and it works and I manage to jump riccardo. Then my Jeff comes on the radio around lap 11 telling me about rain. In a few minutes. End of that lap it starts to rain. I then get tagged by riccardo coming out the hairpin and decide to make a big risk and switch to inters. It doesn’t rain long enough for the inters to work and I finish 15th. 

Most of these are my mistakes. But first season everything just seemed to go right.  2nd season I’m just not getting the luck. 

Anyone else the same? Either taking a gamble and not working or just no luck. "

Let me explain the problem that I am trying to solve for me and hopefully many other cryptomaniacs: 
Ever scrolled through the Top 100 Coins by MarketCap trying to find the next project you'd like to learn about, potentially end up supporting, investing in?
Ever had the problem of ""hmm did I already check that coin out or not?""... It's hard to keep track of the projects you like, the ones that you checked out, the ones you aren't interested in this way.
There is no fun and easy way to discover new cryptocurrencies. That's why I created Cryptogazing. You can think of it as a ""sort of Tinder"" for matching people with cryptocurrencies.

The app is currently released as a Beta Test Version in the Google Play Store: 
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cryptogazing.alpha

But it is also available as a WebApp for Desktop, Tablet or Mobile or whatever platform: https://cryptogazing.com/

I hope some of you guys like the idea and find the app useful. I am looking for Feedback from Testers for this first Beta release, so that I can fix potential bugs and add some improvements.

There are many features lined up already, which are described here:
https://cryptogazing.com/upcoming

As said, I’d appreciate some feedback, let me know what you think, thank you very much!"

 I think of you constantly. 

I press my hand to the pale smooth subconscious inside me and... 

I feel the faint warmth of you there in those memories

 I tried long to forget.

 I’m pathetic, 

paltry, 

dull, 

and useless 

without you.

I’ve repeated the cycle incessantly, moved on time and again.

But the bile churns deep, burning. 

I feel the blue of distance 

in between the long stained fragments of something which I cannot name. 

I look to the wall, 

then I look to the floor, 

then I look to the distant shore that isn’t there. 

How worthless can one man be? 

To spend so many countless eternities longing

 for what has passed

 and will never come to pass.

 I wish I could live forever. 

But it feels like I’ve already lived countless lifetimes. 

The endless sky of the earth and innumerable stars of the cosmos stare.

 I reach to them knowing I’ll never... 

Because I’m still here. 

With them. 

With my friends 

and family 

and all the material beings of the earth.

The distractions I’ve brought

 into my life 

because I no longer have you.

 I wish I knew what was broken inside me. 

Why I can never seem to drown out each shadow 

back down into my seas of implacable terrors. 

I can’t cry even though I want to. 

I want to say it’s because I feel nothing anymore, 

that I’ve become numb to the longing and...

the countless waves cascading across countless looking glasses.

 But it’s beyond nothingness, 

it’s a fullness of earnest emotion which drives me to fill myself constantly,

 to the brim in agony, 

happiness, 

resentment, 

and hope.

 I make no sense. 

     I still remember that day in the rain, when your 

drenched hand came into mine. 

I picture 

                                                                    the pipe that went through my chest that 

                                                                                                             evening 

                                                                                 every 

             chance 

I get.  

                                                                                                    It was sharp, a million euphoric

                                                                    ridges langorously scraping 

against pliable flesh mixed into squishy

                                        brown viscera that rotted into sulfur and egg.

                                                                                                                               I chewed on the flower of our passion,   
                                     until it turned into calabash slime,

                                                                                                                                                                                                            my lips felt numb. 

They bled.

 How could I ever have had the nerve to doubt you? 

You never doubted me. 

I was nothing when I met you, 

though, 

I'm still nothing even now 

with you... 

But you gave my life worth, 

you continue to give it worth even through the blue of distance. 

I was your loving slave, 

I craved your touch even when I turned black.

I wish I could be alone.

 I want to be alone with the imprint of you. 

Forever.

 But life moves on. 

I wish it could move on without me.

 I wish I could be left behind by the world. 

 Your space-time merry go-round comes. 

Its lilac dust

 falls gently in my nose

 like grains of sand 

crunching 

in my mouth. 

I listen to the nectar and see the music of your heart.

 An aurora encapsulates the powder of my being, 

stars detonating. 

You’re there, 

as I’m falling to Earth

 from the powder keg of creation itself, 

holding my hand like you did in that rain. 

I feel the blue of distance on my lips. 

And every part of my body you penetrated and consumed from my cock 

to each nipple and finger and testicle 

you’ve ever gifted in the crimson pleasure of your purest passion. 

And every release;

every release 

after release 

after release 

after orgasmic release you’ve ever given me 

because I was so...

worthless, 

pathetic, 

paltry, 

dull, 

and useless 

without you. 

Because you thought I had 

worth, 

talent, 

and vibrance.

 The blue of distance calls upon my every eternity...

      

I think of you constantly. 

I press my hand to the pale smooth subconscious inside me and... "

I have been doing keto for little over a month and I really like the results. However, I don't feel like I am doing it right enough and that mainly has to do because of the fact that I can't figure out how much I have to eat every day, especially when it comes to protein. Currently, I eat something like 15gr of carbs, 60-80gr of protein and around 100gr of fat.

There are a bazzilion macro calculators and all of them give me different results other than the carb intake.
while calculators advice a range of 100 to 130gr of fat everyday (which I find an acceptable range) when it comes to protein
I get results anywhere from 40g to 125gr a day recommended to me for my age,weight,height and activity although most calculators recommend somewhere around 70-80.

But I don't understand. One thing I do find consistently is that ""A keto diet plan consists of 5% carbs, 20% of protein and 75% of fat""
but that doesn't add up with the calculators at all. If I where to eat 112,5 gr of fat that would mean I would need to eat 30gr of protein and 7,5gr of carbs.

I am sure I am misunderstanding something so I have come to this reddit to ask if someone could clear this up and tell me what my daily intake should be.

Thank you for reading.

I've never been on an actual date with anyone and neither has she. I never realized that I was attracted to her until about a month ago.

I had one of my (F) friends be a wingman for me and left the room after we had all watched a scary movie. A few moments of not-that-awkward silence and then I mustered the courage to ask her out. It kind of went something like this: ""Hey, I really have been enjoying getting to know you more recently and was wondering if you would like to go on a date with me?"". She kind of panicked but then started talking about another guy who asked her out a few years ago who was really awkward about it, she never gave him a response even though it seemed to be an obvious no. 

I offered her that she could take her time in giving me a response, but I would like an actual yes/no answer. She is a kind of person that stresses out about things and will procrastinate things, but I asked her on Aug 26th. Our recently gaming sessions (with multiple other people in the call) have been normal and she still laughs at my jokes like she did before, she doesn't seem any different.

Is it time to ask for an answer? Should I do it over voice call or should I wait until we hang out in person again.

Thanks!"
