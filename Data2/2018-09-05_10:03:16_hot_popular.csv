33,"My immigrant, deaf father was choked, body-slammed, arrested and had his sentry card taken away at the border for failing to comply to an audible demand. I want a copy of the video and his sentry card back.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb276f780>,charlysotelo,0,76,2178,False,legaladvice,,1536123018.0,9d35r8,"A little background: 

My entire family and I are naturalized citizens from Mexico. We were all born and raised in Mexico and we tend to visit a lot of family and friends on an almost daily matter. We live in San Diego and in order to avoid hours of waiting at the border, we applied for and received [Sentry cards](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/sentri/how-apply-sentri). We are hard-working people, engineers, educators, pay our taxes, etc...

My father was crossing back across the border into the US in one of the sentry lanes during labor day at around 7 PM. My father was driving, my mother in the passenger seat, and my pregnant sister-in-law and my niece were in the back of the car. According to the accounts of my family, there were two border patrol officers on the passenger side checking sentry cards before the actual booth. One of the officers made a hand signal in the shape of a license, implying that my dad flash the sentry cards, which he did - but the officer did not see it. The officer starts walking in front of the vehicle towards the driver side door while making the same motion and yelling something out which my father does not make out (he is deaf). He starts banging on the drivers side door. My father once again flashes the sentry cards and says ""Here it is!"". 

My family says that the officer did not like the tone my father was using and said ""OK. I'm gonna get your sentry card taken away"". My father opens the car door, confused and interpreting the banging on it as the officer asking to open it up. The officer then proceeds to choke my dad, drag him out of the car and handcuff him. My mother tried to explain that my father was deaf and wasn't understanding what the officer wanted. He replied with ""I don't care"".

Afterwards, my father was taken to a processing facility and released without any charges - except the officer was successful in taking his sentry card.

For obvious reasons this angers me - it really complicates our way of life here in a border city. I'd like to recover my dads sentry card.

I also would like to acquire video of the situation if possible. Border crossings are high-security environments and I know there must be video of the incident in possession by the BP officers. How would I go about getting video of the incident?"

I always carry a knife. I have a collection, all are carried and used, and I select my knives by quality of make, blade material, and function. The other bit of necessary info is that I share a hobby workspace with a friend (GG for Great Guy) and his idiot brother (IB). In this space we carry out woodworking, smithing, and various other projects in our leisure time, together and separately. 

GG and I have a similar philosophy about preparedness. We carry a minimal amount of quality tools, and we maintain them and use them in a manner that facilitates their continued use. IB, however, enjoys a disorganized mess of tools in various states of disrepair and rust, which he keeps in the bed of his truck. He dislikes searching through his tool pile to find what he needs, and often abuses tools to their breaking point, so he often “borrows” tools from myself and his brother.

One day, while loosening some screws in metal plates, IB asks GG to see his knife (he was carrying a laser marked OTF Benchmade Infidel with a custom cut blade release, worth about $500). GG assumed that IB wanted to cut a strip of rubber sheeting to aid in removing a stripped screw and handed over the knife. I watched IB return the knife a short while later. 5 min after receiving his knife back, GG actuates the knife to discover a chip half the size of a dime in the blade. IB had attempted to use the knife as a screwdriver. Cue a huge screaming match about “why the hell wouldn’t you use a screwdriver?”, culminating in a fistfight.

A few weeks later, IB asks to use my knife. I explicitly tell him to only use it if he is going to cut something, to which he agrees. I hand over my knife (Ontario Rat 1 in D2,~$40). I have two of these knives, and they are t terribly expensive, but this particular knife accompanied me on a trip to a nasty sandbox earlier in my life, and ended up saving my ass. I replaced the AUS 8 blade when I was back but the knife still has sentimental value. As it turns out, the “something” that IB cut was a paintcan, and he ended up cutting it because he snapped the tip off my knife trying to pry the cab open, leaving the blade needing to be completely reground. I calmly tried to explain that I spend money on quality tools and I respect their intended use because I want them to continue to be useful. Condescendingly, IB tells me that my pussy knife isn’t quality if it got damaged from his using it. “Tools are for using!” He tells me.

The next week, IB asks to borrow my knife. I ask him to explicitly explain what he wants to do with it. He scoffs and rolls his eyes, before patronizingly explaining that he wants to cut twine. This seems reasonable, I walk over and hand over my knife (Spyderco Paramilitary 2 in S110V, ~$150). He uses it normally, so I walk away to stop a heat treating oven and remove the contents. He calls my attention from across the shop and yells “heads up!” As he tosses my OPEN knife to me from 30 feet away, I drop a hot piece of 1095 as I try to get out of the way of a knife that I spent an hour stropping down to a half micron edge, before I watch it hit the floor, snapping off the tip. IB of course thinks my panic and then rage is hilarious, and takes the piss out of my knife for breaking so easily.

IB stops asking to borrow our knives after we refuse to loan them to him for a few weeks. He buys gas station cheapos and breaks them on a weekly basis, while telling us that it’s no big deal because they aren’t expensive. We smile and play along, until the ribbing gets too much. I infer that, since he has such a large knife budget, he can afford to replace GG and my knives that he has broken. He loses his temper and hems and haws about how we were able to do repairs, and find replacement blades. I insist that he replace GG’s infidel as the customization work we did to the blade release voided the warranty, but he insists that it’s GG’s fault for loaning him the blade. So, I let it go, then get the idea that it would be just fine to unscrew my vice and move it to a different table.  I ask IB if I can borrow his Starrett electronic calipers (~$2,500)  a hot second, as my inferior calipers are unsuited for the work I’m about to do. Ego stroked, he deigns to lend me the tool. I move over to the first nut on my vice and tighten the calipers up. GG’s eyes widen as he realizes my intentions. He looks away, a silent endorsement of my plan. I hold the calipers in place and begin to twist. And I don’t stop. I cranked those motherfuckers till they started to cry.  I attempted to loosen every but holding my vice to the table, before determining that the ruined calipers were simply a bad quality tool. Then I whipped them at IB from across the shop yelling “heads up!”. IB no longer asks to borrow anything from us, and has since gotten his own workspace. He also threatened legal action after I refused to replace his calipers. I maintain that I am not responsible for any damages, cuz hey man, tools are meant to be used."

So I'm a mom and as I'm sure most of you know,  a kid's favorite time to bug you is when you're trying to do anything for yourself. I always lock the bathroom door when I'm in there but for some reason last night I decided, ""Meh."" I'm in the shower and of course here walks in my 7yr old blah blah blahing. She finally leaves and when she does she leaves the damn door open. So when I get out I normally stand on my bath mat and dry off but I wanted to shut the door so I step over to shut it and when I step back I slip on the wet tile. My leg bends in, I hear a pop and it goes jelly-fied. I fall hitting my ass on my toilet (my fucking tailbone hurts like a bitch today.) then roll off onto the floor. Starting yelling oh fuck and my kids run in. Ask them to bring my phone and call EMS because I can't move. Then I get incredibly nauseous and pass out. EMS shows up, helps me to my couch, and checks me out. Offered to drive me to the hospital but I figure they have people that need them more than I do so I wait for my mom to come get me. Fucking torn ACL. Wtf. Now I'm looking at possible surgery and months of rehab all because I didn't lock the fucking door..

tl;dr Didn't lock the bathroom door so my kid came in and left it open. Slipped tearing my acl and now possibly need surgery and tons of rehab."

Hermione was uptight and a perfectionist while Ron was laid back and didn’t worry about tests. I think those features complemented each other perfectly and they were able to learn from each other to be more laid back or to be more serious. Another thing is I think other ships people have are plain idiotic. Dramione, Hermione being with the boy who hated her, called her offensive words, said he wished she died and much more terrible things. And Snape and Hermione, Snape a what 44 year old man? With a teen girl. 🤔 The same Snape who was rude to her at every chance possible for no reason? I don’t mind if you do like these ships but imo they just don’t work. "
