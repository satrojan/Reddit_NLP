NFL Week 1 Picks

Thursday Night Special

Falcons v Eagles

Bird battle to begin the season. I hate the Falcons. I don’t know why. A team with ALL. OF. THE. TALENT. IN. THE. WORLD. and they went 10-6. I guess when you trade Shanahan for Sark at OC, Matt Ryan can’t win — or throw to Julio Jones. Fly Eagles Fly (though I’m REALLY concerned that Nick Foles totally turned in to a pumpkin sometime in July).

Green birds win by 14"

7,Don’t follow road rules? Have fun sitting behind me at a red light!!,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fcfb7e2ff98>,ricefriskies,0,0,1,False,pettyrevenge,,1536107933.0,9d1dno,"Sorry if it’s not petty enough, but I felt this warranted some sort of revenge.

Today I was at a 4 way intersection minding my own business. The two two people on my side went forward so it was my turn to go. I was making a left turn.

This particular intersection is weird because it has 3 lanes on one road, 2 on 2 others, and 5 on the one opposite of the 3 lane. I was in a 2 lane turning left, and the offender was in the farthest right lane on my right (3 lane road).

As I was turning left, the offender decided that a rolling stop was good enough since the car next to her just left. I honked at her to let her know that she was in the wrong and I was kinda pissed that she went while I was turning.

Wow. Bad idea. She thought I was out to get her with that honk.

I turned right into the middle of 3 lanes on the 5 lane road. I had to get into the right lane to turn right and there was space in front of offender. I turn on my blinker and speed up a bit to get in front of her and she speeds up as well!! I end up getting in front of her and she goes livid. She starts pointing at her dash cam and yelling at me (at one point her passenger sticks his head out the car to yell at me?! Idk), I think she may have called the cops or someone on me even.

Anyway, I was in the right turn lane and it was a red light. The opposite lane had a green left arrow, so they were all turning left. I was at the front of this red light and I was already furious. So what else can I do? I sit at wait at that red light until it turns green.

Yeah people were behind her and she kept turning around to look at them, but every time I glanced in my rear view mirror at her, she was yelling at me to go. 

I was just keeping myself calm and safe. Sorry for being a good driver."

Worse yet, last week, at one of the largest State Fairs in the country, at a spot just outside the gates (and underneath a street overpass as it has been raining frequently), there were no less than *eight YOUNG* JWs with carts, smiling and trying to bait fairgoers. The guys were wearing suits, and two young women looked like LDS sister missionaries from a distance until I saw the racks.

Later that day, the same spot was taken over by 8 different people, a little bit older on average but still looking like unsavory people with smiles on their faces.

These sex scandals plaguing the ~~Mormon Church~~ Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints are like a goldmine to the Gee Bees, as potential converts scared off by these scandals might think The Watchtower doesn't have the same issues and may be a warm and inviting place. The lack of media coverage of JW shenanigans doesn't help matters. Few know of the suburban Detroit tragedy. We need to wake people up of the dangers of *all* cults!

Also I got rejected on Friday which is somewhat important especially to the beginning of my tale.

Story:
So, today I was hanging with not my usual friends(including one guy I'm really close to we'll call Frank), since I got rejected and the girl hangs out with them. I had told another of my friends and he was supportive about my broken heart. Anyway, he sat with me in class today and told me: ""Don't worry, I can't hang with them either."" Naturally, I asked him why. He refused to tell me and I dropped it. Then he asks ""You promise not to stop talking to me."" And I say, ""Why would I stop talking to you over something as small as not hanging out with my friends."" Like 5 minutes later he texts me(we're still sitting next to each other). ""It's because I like Frank."" I just sat there in shock. I wrote back ""Really?"" And he says ""Yeah, I like boys and girls too.""

I didn't know what to say, I just said ""Oh, I understand know"" and then changed the subject. I feel like I should have said more or something. It also breaks my heart because I know that Frank is straight and yeah.

Tl;dr: My friend came out to me as bisexual by saying he has a crush on another of my male friends."

This is so you can better yourself, learn from your mistakes, and prepare for future relationships. 

This piece of advice is something I found really hard to come to terms with. I was completely blindsighted by my breakup and saw no signs of what was to come. My S/O was loving and attentive up until the day he broke up with me, citing commitment issues and the need to work on himself. The classic “it’s not you, it’s me”. He consistently reinforced this point as I struggled to understand what was happening. 

In hindsight, I had a lot of trouble figuring out how I contributed to the breakup and what I could have done to make it work. I still don’t think I would have done anything differently than I did. 

Then it hit me as I lay awake last night. It was never a problem with how I acted in the relationship- it was a problem with how I acted towards myself.

I put my everything into one person. Not just my love and my future, but my own self-worth. I unknowingly let one person decide the value of myself.  I thought I was nothing without this person. If I didn’t have him in my life, it would be empty. 

As he was breaking up with me and as I was begging and pleading for the relationship to continue, I found myself willing to settle for so much less than I deserved. Was I really okay with giving him as much space as he needed? Was I really okay with settling for a now loveless relationship? 

That’s where I have to believe it’s a fine line between love and worth, but it’s important to know there is a difference. Your worth is not equivalent to the amount that someone loves you. If that is the case for you, you will continue to be devastated when someone leaves, and you will continue to settle for unhealthy relationships. 

It is an important part of life to find a partner, but it is more important to realize that you are just as whole and just as brilliant without that person there. Just because someone tries to kill the flame you share together, doesn’t mean that you cannot continue to shine in your own light."

**Brett Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee Tuesday morning and the hearing immediately turned into a circus.**

Democrats and protesters interrupted the process for the first half hour.
   
 Screaming leftists continued to disrupt the hearing for several hours.

**Tom Fitton told Lou Dobbs the protesters were breaking the law.**

****Tom Fitton:** There’s an air of violence, intimidation and lawlessness. In fact, you all of those three elements at a hearing for a Supreme Court Justice nomination, shows you the left has a fundamental dislike for the rule of law and the US Constitution. Those protesters weren’t protesting they were engaging in illegal activity disrupting a lawful hearing. And those arrests were not peaceful arrests, they were resisting arrest, that’s what it looks like if you look at the videos assuming the media is going to cover this… That disruption was against the law!**

I recently decided to give colemak a try because I want to try take better care of my hands and wrists. However I have been reading up a bit and have heard stories of people forgetting how to type in qwerty all together which worries me a little. Ideally I want to be proficient in both qwerty and colemak. Is this possible? If I'm worried about losing qwerty proficiency but still want ergonomics should I just use a qwerty split ergo board? I'm not trying to learn colemak to be more efficient/faster because I already type at 90 WPM on qwerty so I'm already comfortable with that speed.

This is probably just me worrying too much but does anyone here manage to stay proficient in both layouts? Thank you for listening "
