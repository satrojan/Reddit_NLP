0,Because 2am is an excellent time to ask your child a question,crazyspottedcatlady,0,4,32,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536059906.0,9cuopp,"A bit of context is required for this one, because it involves the cousin of my mother's first sister. Said sister was a little shit as a kid and forever telling lies and setting her siblings up to get them in trouble with their parents. My grandma caught her one day inflicting injuries on herself (not major - think something like a rug burn) which she claimed her brothers had inflicted, not knowing grandma had seen her doing it to herself.  This was in the day where Feet Didn't Touch if you misbehaved so you can imagine how that worked out for her. My grandma never did believe a word that came out of her mouth afterwards.

Now my mom is well established as being nocturnal. She's never out of bed before 12pm and even that's pushing it. This results in her being up all night, which is also important.

My aunt had three children but her youngest was the only girl. My mom occasionally babysat the girl for her (this was also the only *socialisation* I received as a child) and she would ""play"" with me (read: be a little shit until she got her own way). This occasion was one of those times.  At the time, she was sitting on the floor in front of the desk I was sitting at colouring, watching the TV. As they tend to do when put down carelessly by a young child, one of my crayons rolled off the edge of the desk and bonked her on the head.  She wasn't upset at the time, and handed me my crayon back, and that was it as far as I was concerned.

Until 2am that morning, when my mother dragged me out of bed. I'm confused, tired and scared because if looks could kill, she'd be childless.  She demands to know if I had bullied my cousin.

Yes, my auntie called her later that evening and apparently my cousin had told a tale about how I kept hitting her in the head with my crayons on purpose.

My mother waited until 2am so she could drag me out of bed and scare the crap out of me to accuse me of bullying my cousin.  Who was very much her mother's double and well known for telling tall tales just like her mother.

In fairness, I wouldn't be angry about this looking back if she hadn't *waited until 2am* to ask me about it, thus disturbing my sleep. She had a damn good idea that these accusations were false anyway, and when she went back to my auntie to tell her my cousin was a lying little shit, she even pointed out the hundreds of times my auntie had *told lies to get her in trouble with their parents* before now as to why her precious little angel would lie about me throwing crayons at her!

The upside was said cousin wasn't allowed to come over any more, which as you can imagine was no great loss to me.  As far as I'm aware, she's grown up considerably and has a family of her own now, but we're NC because of this incident.

An update on the health stuff also touched upon on the last post: I know full well that I have FM's in the family.  I'm not too concerned because I simply don't share anything I'm not okay with eventually making its way back to my mom.  In any case, I have been diagnosed recently with a condition that can either be a standalone ailment, or a symptom of two or three other, more severe ailments, so the current plan is to treat it as if it were the standalone ailment for now and see if it improves - if not, then we dig deeper.  This means I've currently got a splint on the affected limb.

My mom's input, on learning that I had this condition, which is absolutely NOTHING to do with genetics: ""The wrists in this family have always been weak!"" The only history of anything remotely similar in my family is a case of repetitive strain injury, which is not even close to what I have been assessed with.  NC and I still can't be ill, apparently."
1,"I don't like that, therefore, you don't like that",lukeluck101,0,44,196,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536015016.0,9cq16c,"I just went to the make myself a bowl of bran flakes in the kitchen, and suddenly remembered an episode from my childhood that I'd completely forgotten about for years.

I must have been no older than 10 at the time, our family were staying at a hotel and one day we went to the breakfast buffet. I looked at the cereal and I was intrigued by this bowl of brown things that looked kind of like cornflakes, they looked appetising and I wanted to see what they tasted like (I was a weird kid OK). 

My dad said to me: ""you don't like bran flakes, they taste of cardboard""

I don't remember anything else about that day. Just the disappointment I felt at being told I wasn't allowed to even taste something right in front of me, for no good reason, when I was really curious about it. 

I didn't know what a narcissist parent was until this year. And now that I know, something really struck me about what my dad said.

He didn't say ""you wouldn't like those"". He said ""you don't like those"". It makes so much sense to me now. There's huge meaning in that subtle change of words. I'd never tried bran flakes before in my life, but he wasn't speculating on whether I'd actually like them or not. He wasn't warning me that I should try something else because I probably wouldn't like them. No, what he was saying, subconsciously, was:

""In my mind, you are not a separate person with their own set of likes and dislikes, and their own sense of curiosity. You are an extension of me and my ego. I don't like bran flakes, therefore, you don't like bran flakes"".

Here I am, 20 years later, posting on reddit whilst eating bran flakes because I actually like bran flakes.

Even if they do taste a little bit like cardboard."

3,"Moisturizer Nazi got a taste of her own medicine, and DH is on my side again (update)",cindyxloowho,0,157,1006,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536086928.0,9cyj9o,"(TL;DR of this whole ordeal: DH basically went full mama’s boy with JNMIL after she moved in with us and was letting her read my angry texts. They cracked a joke about my moisturizer choices and that was the last straw. DH promised to talk to her, but never did.)
Also, potato format cause I’m on mobile.

Thank you to everyone for your advice, it really helped me grow some hypothetical balls. 

As I stated in my last update, DH started seeing my point of view, for an entire night, before JNMIL sucked him back into his unhealthy sharing of our relationship problems. 
Since he’s off work on Saturdays, I formed a plan. A plan to give each of them a taste of their own medicine. First, I invited my cousin and sisters over without telling either of them. I made sure they came over when they both least expected it, bright and early.  When they showed up, I decided to let my sisters make breakfast. DH walks out and is visibly irritated. My sister asks if he wants some eggs and bacon, he says sure and sits down with us. Like clockwork, this is when JNMIL decides to join us as well. We’re all eating breakfast and my sisters and cousin bring up the fact that my daughter’s birthday is coming up soon. JNMIL says “I know, it really sucks that I have to visit my other son in (state) &amp; miss the party.” to which my cousin responds with “That sucks, OP’s  mom is planning the entire thing and even took off work that weekend to make sure it was perfect. I wish you could be here to see it.” 
Keep in mind, this is the same cousin i vented to about everything prior to this, so I was doing an internal victory scream when she said this.
JNMIL replies “I know, I just really want to be there for my son and see my newest grandbaby. She looks *just* like him.” 

After everyone’s done eating, cousin decides to try and bait JNMIL into talking bad about me in front of my sisters. She says “Isn’t it nice not having to cook breakfast?” I almost expected JNMIL to not say anything, then again, she wouldn’t be a JNMIL if she didn’t. 
She says “OP never makes breakfast like this cause she usually just gives the kids cereal, so yeah it is.” 
Bingo. 
My sisters darted their eyes at each other and my youngest sister says “Well, it *is* hard cooking for three kids as it is, let alone two adults on top of that.” 
JNMIL rebuttals with “I used to make a big  breakfast for my 5 children and my husband every morning when I didn’t work.” 
My middle sister starts picking up on what I was talking about and replies “Well, DH could always make his own breakfast if he wants a big meal, OP is the one with the kids all the time. It’s only fair.” 
JNMIL scrunches up her face and says “He shouldn’t have to, he works so she can stay home all day. I used to stay at home with my kids too and I still managed to get a warm breakfast made every morning until I started working again.” 
DH notices the tension rising and changes the subject by saying “What do you guys want to do today?”. My cousin says “We just wanted to visit for the day. OP has been telling me how lonely she’s been feeling, so we thought we’d come keep her company.” 
DH gives me a ‘wtf you told them?’ look. 
I ignore it. 
Skip to the evening, JNMIL asks what we want for dinner. 
Middle Sister decided to reply with “Isn’t OP gonna cook? You said she never makes big meals, you should let her cook for you.” 
JNMIL says “Well, she does cook but it’s usually just the same old stuff.” 
My youngest sister starts getting irritated, 
“Well, you don’t want her to cook, then you get mad at her for not cooking? That makes no sense!” 
I get a text from DH that says “Tell your sister to calm down, dude.” 
My inner smart ass jumped out and I tell my sister, “DH just texted me to tell you to calm down.” 
My cousin &amp; oldest sister are holding back chuckles now. 
Youngest sister is fully triggered at this point. 
She tells JNMIL, “You know what? I’m not gonna calm down, cause I don’t think you should putting OP down all the time. That’s my sister, and I’m not gonna let you talk about her that way without saying anything.” 
It gets quiet again, and my sisters and cousin get up to go outside to play on the trampoline with my kids. 
The doorbell rings and I realize DH ordered some pizzas. 
When I go to the door to get them, JNMIL sees me and loses it  “Are you seriously that vindictive that you’re gonna waste money on pizza when I *just* offered to cook dinner? Are you really *that* upset over what I said? I didn’t mean it that way, you need to get over yourself! All I said was that you didn’t know how to cook like me, it was supposed to be a joke!! You &amp; your family are being ridiculous!” 
I was left speechless and was about to start crying, when DH walks up and says “THAT IS ENOUGH MOM! I ORDERED THEM! LEAVE HER THE HELL ALONE ! WHY CAN’T YOU EVER JUST BE NICE TO HER? STOP!! YOU’RE PISSING ME OFF NOW!” 
JNMIL was obviously caught off guard, and she scoffs and replies “ Well, how was I supposed to know that? You know I don’t mean it like that! She’s allowed to bitch at you all the time, but I’m not allowed to tease her about one little thing? Do we all have to treat her like a baby now?” She looks and sees that I’m crying, rolls her eyes and sits down at the table. 
My sisters and cousin bring our kids back inside to eat, then pull me aside and ask what’s wrong. I tell them, and my sister storms into the kitchen and asks my children to go outside again for a minute. 
They leave, and she starts going in “YOU SHOULD BE THANKFUL THAT OP &amp; DH ARE EVEN LETTING YOU LIVE HERE! IF I WERE HER, I WOULD’VE KICKED YOU OUT WEEKS AGO!” 
JNMIL claps back with “SHE TREATS MY SON LIKE SHIT! SHES ALWAYS BITCHING AT HIM AND PUTTING HIM DOWN! MAYBE YOU SHOULD TALK TO HER, NOT ME!” 
At this point DH is visibly pissed, “OKAY! EVERYONE WHO DOESN’T LIVE HERE, LEAVE! NOW!” JNMIL puts on a smug smile, then DH says “YOU TOO MOM!”.  She packs a bag and has a cab take her to his sister’s house. 
JNMIL hasn’t talked to me since, but DH said she’s coming back tonight and wants to have a “civil” conversation with the both of us. 
I told him I wanted her out by the start of December and he said okay. 
Will post another update after this.

4,MIL Screenshoting Private FB Groups,Mkpencenonethericher,0,34,410,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536095446.0,9czrla,"Today, my lovely friends, my boyfriend’s mom for got that he texts her from my phone. She sent him screenshots of a post I made in a private FB group that she is not in. The group is about Gentle Parenting (my SO and I have a babber).She carefully clipped them to make sure she didn’t include my comments and tried to make it look like I was sneaking around behind his back to take custody of our child. 

Now is a good time for me to add that I love my SO, he’s an amazing father. I don’t want him to leave the room half the time, let alone leave our lives. We need him and love him. 

The best part of the story is that I used that post (which my SO knew about) to ask for advice to be a kinder partner to him when we disagree. We had read the post and all of its comments together as a spring board for solving the original problem together. 

TL:DR, showed my boyfriend nice things I said on the internet, his mom tired to spin it as mean. Also, why is she stalking me in Facebook groups? She’s not even my on my friend list. "
5,Therapist brought up family model,chromie_heart,0,1,3,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536117617.0,9d2kom,"Just kind of a feel good thing, but I finally got up the balls to see the counselor at my college (he doesn’t have a great reputation, but he’s better than nothing), and after me talking a bit about my family, he brought up the narcissistic family model with no prompting by me. It was just really validating to hear from a professional that this fit the mold, because I’ve spent so much time doubting it. I first came across narc abuse when I was in my sophomore year of high school, I think - I’m in my junior year of college now, and it’s still hard for me to accept that that’s what going on. It was so good to hear from him, without me bringing it up, that what I go through fits that mold. "
6,I hate it when my nMum is overly friendly with me...,0Bonbons0,0,11,20,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536052610.0,9ctzpc,"It just feels weird. She called me yesterday and was just casually chatting about stuff but I was quite distant, which she noticed, so she asked me if I enjoy talking to her. I didn't know how to answer so I just asked her why she'd ask me that and that I just don't have a lot going on at the moment so I don't have much to say.

Then she said that she felt like she was losing me and was feeling all emotional and nostalgic. It's probably because I recently started standing up for myself (I've been hanging out with my dad a lot more so she would often try to guilt trip me or rant about how he is demonic and left her in debt blablabla and then goes on to say that she holds no grudges and she's fine)

Most of the stories on here are really horrible and full on abusive, but my nMum is on a lower level of narcissism and I feel really bad that I am incapable of feeling normal around her. I get irritable and defensive around her. I just don't know what to do.

 I just needed to vent a bit and was also wondering if there is anyone else here with a lower level Nparent who can relate?

7,I had no idea that it wasn't just me.,MoosesMom7,0,14,26,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536052407.0,9ctz2y,"I've been a lurker for a while now, and I didn't realize just how many people had similar stories to my own. I could probably write a book about the crap I had to deal with growing up. I think it's important to share stories, and see commonalities, so here's mine. 

&#x200B;

My Mother is a narcissist. As a little girl, I was her baby doll, being dressed up in the cutest dresses and being constantly doted on. Once I started talking, that's when everything went down hill. I would be yelled at, hit, called every name in the book, and was basically her slave. If she wasn't giving me a verbal beatdown, she was ordering me around, ""take out the trash"", ""make me food"", & and so many others. She went so far as to encourage me to commit suicide, and had I actually been suicidal at the time, I can't say that I wouldn't have followed through with it. There were a few times in high school when she didn't allow me to shower because it would, ""raise the light bill"".  My aunts and uncle, were always her sisters and brother, she never spoke of them in relation to me. No matter what happened, it was never her fault. She got arrested once, and it was the cop's fault. My dad was a bastard, in her mind, when he gave me stuff and not her. 

&#x200B;

When I was 14, I was hit by a car and taken to the hospital with a dislocated knee. Rather than ask me if I was alright, she got into the room, waited until the doctors and nurses were gone, and told me I was going to get so much money from this. Yep, you read that right. I was just hit by a car, and she was looking forward to the settlement money that I would eventually get. I did get a pretty decent settlement from the accident though, about $9500. Thankfully, my dad was smart and got me a lawyer, and I set up a meeting with her to ask her to hold on to the check until I turned 18. I picked up the check shortly after my 18th birthday, and opened a savings account in my name. Boy was she pissed that she wasn't on the account, she needed the money ""to raise me"". She conned me out of $4000 dollars, which she used to pay off her credit cards, and told me she would pay back... that was over five years ago and I still haven't seen a penny. 

&#x200B;

Sometimes, I'd lose things, like any normal person would. When I'd ask her if she'd seen it, she would say that I was accusing her of stealing it. One time, she swiped a five dollar bill out of my pants and I asked her if she had seen it, as I thought I may have left it on a counter or something, again, I was the bitch for accusing her of stealing. Yet, after I took the dog out to cool off, she called me into my room, lifted a pillow, and lo and behold, there was my money. All nice and flat underneath the pillow. It's kind of hard to believe that she didn't put it there, considering it was crumpled up in my pocket the day before. 

&#x200B;

About a month before I graduated high school, she kicked me out for going to the bathroom before getting ready for school, because it ""went against routine"". I was a ""backwards ass"", which angered me and things escalated to the point where she said, ""your 18, you're on your own, get the fuck out of my house"". I was so upset that when my dad picked me up, I was sitting on the front porch crying. I called off from school that day, I was 18, so I could excuse myself. She got a call saying that I wasn't in class, and reported me skipping. This would have barred me from walking at graduation, and I told her as much. So she got to call the attendance office and excuse the absence so I could walk. Thankfully, she was willing to let me spend the weekend at my father's house, like she did unless she was pissed at him for some stupid reason, and I stuffed my duffel bag as full as I could get it and didn't come home after the weekend. The following Monday, I went to the school counselor and changed my address to my dad's and explained what happened. She was beyond kind and understanding and told me exactly what I had to do. 

&#x200B;

Of course, there were complications, she wouldn't let me have my things or my dog. For about two years, I had to steal from myself just so I could have clothes. She let her crackhead friends sleep in my room, do drugs in there (I once found a makeshift pipe) and take whatever clothes and jewelry they wanted. I was furious when I found my class ring missing, and she got pissed when I confronted her and told her I had reported it stolen, and given the police her friend's names and contact info. 

&#x200B;

It took nearly two years for me to get my dog back, and when I did he was skin and bones, with wounds from a fight with another dog. It took me three days to get him to eat, and he was just barely beginning to gain weight when my mother brought the cops to my house after I refused to give him back to her. She wanted to take him back to the same house, where the dog that attacked him lived, and out of concern for his safety, I said no. Unfortunately, because everything pertaining to him was in her name, I was forced to give him back to her. I told her to never speak to me again. She called me the same damn day and told me to come get him because he'd been hurt again. I was livid. My dad and I were sharing a car at the time, so I didn't have the car until the following monday, and when I went to get him, I was infuriated. She had left him in his kennel the entire weekend, not even letting him out to go to the bathroom. His kennel was soaked in urine, and he was bonier than before, as if he hadn't eaten. I took him home, gave him a bath, fed him, washed out his kennel, set up an appointment with a vet I knew, and got him registered in our county. My baby ate like he was starved. He cleaned the bowl in less than 10 minutes. I would be damned if she took him from me again, as she clearly demonstrated that she wasn't capable of taking care of him. She tried again about six months later, and failed. My Moose has been living with me for about three years now, although he's still got some trust issues surrounding women, he knows that I'll do anything to make sure he has what he needs. He doesn't get hit, he doesn't get yelled at (unless he's doing the yelling), and he doesn't get locked in the kennel unless we have to leave for more than a couple hours (he gets bored and destroys the apartment).

&#x200B;

My mother has more recently convinced my family that I'm nothing but a liar and a thief. None of my maternal family members speak to me, especially after I cut my mother out of my life a couple years ago. I only have one cousin who talks to me because he's lived with her. He knows what she's like, and he saw the way she treated me. He's the only one who believed me. 

&#x200B;

One of her favorite abuse techniques is telephone harassment. She used to call me upwards of 40 times a day, calling me every name in the book, detailing how she was going to get me fired, making threats on my life, things like that. Eventually, she got my work phone number, and started harassing me at work. So, my boss got involved, and called a couple friends of his at the local police department (he had retired from there several years earlier). I spoke to an officer, and explained what was happening, let her listen to the voicemails that she left. And she said that she would tell her to cut it out, but, if she did that, I couldn't reach out to her. This was because, if I wanted to press telephone harassment charges, the DA wouldn't take the case if I'd reached out and contacted her. I agreed not to contact her. Little did I know, I had just made the best decision of my life. 

&#x200B;

About a year after she threw me out, I was diagnosed with anxiety, likely caused by the abuse from my mother. It took over a year of therapy, and daily SSRI's, but I'm doing really well. Cutting her out of my life was one of the best things I ever did, and I don't regret it in the slightest. I have a wonderful Fiance, a nice apartment, Moose is spoiled rotten, and things are looking great for me. It's possible to overcome the lifetimes of abuse we all suffer. It's not easy, but it's doable. No contact has been a great thing for me, and I have no reason or desire to make contact with her. And I'm determined to not raise my children the way she raised me. I refuse to be that kind of mother. Our family's cycle of abuse stops with me. "
8,"Gather around, my children",DJStrongThenKill,0,189,829,False,JUSTNOMIL,butts,1535912522.0,9ce9jg,"Thanks to the recent influx of peeps from askreddit mentions, the power hungry mods have decided to reiterate some of our rules and remind everyone of the newest rule changes. 

One post per day. Seriously, don’t spam. 

SO bashing is not tolerated. Let me repeat that for those in the back, SO BASHING IS NOT TOLERATED. I speak for all of the mods when I say that it’s super annoying to open up modmail and find numerous reports on comments because people cannot/will not follow the rules. Telling OP to leave their SO and/or insulting the SO will receive a ban. 

Do not DM mods. We prefer that you message us through mod mail so that we can discuss everything together because we are a team. Attempts to triangulate the mods against each other will be met with a temp ban and we will laugh at you. 

Encourage, advise, and comfort, don't fear monger. We are a team of different thoughts, not one hive mind of terror. Fear mongering will earn a temp ban or a perma ban, depending on the severity. That’s up to the mod who handles the report or finds it. 

If you're offended that's your responsibility, not OPs. If you can’t say anything nice in a support group, don’t say anything at all. 

Don't word police. We look for poor attitudes and genuine prejudice, we do not try to fight the useless uphill battle of censorship through word policing. Obviously there's not a place for someone talking about ""daddy's cummies 💦,"" but if it's something MIL said we aren't stopping you from describing relevant information. If you are offended at something not directed specifically towards you that is your responsibility. Still, don't hesitate to hit report it you think it might be hate speech against a group no matter what language used.

We need to respect anonymity here. So no chasing users across various subs or linking to their profile after they’ve deleted their posts. 

/u/Made_you_read_penis should be worshipped as a God, and requires sacrifices of eggplant emojis to be send their way at every possible occasion.

/u/dietotaku needs BTS gifs to survive. 

/u/mysisteristrash is my bae. That’s all. 


We put a lot of time and effort into moderating this subreddit and it’s because we genuinely love what this community has become. Let’s all do our part in making r/JustNoMIL great again.

I’m NC, and have been for over a year. The first day they did a number on him saying that they were just so hurt that I wouldn’t return their calls and that they bought me some expensive gift and they just wanted to talk to me. Friend gets a call from her brother that night about how maybe I had gone too far and that friend needs to reach out to me on their behalf. She says no, and that I have my reasons end of conversation. Her brother goes back to their house the next day, and apparently thinking that he’s now on their side, they spend the entire day ranting about how I’m an “ungrateful fucking bitch” and just really letting all of their crazy awful behavior hang out. 
He called my friend at the end of that day to say that she had been right and that they’re nuts. 

Now, of course this is all secondhand from my friend, but it matches their behavior exactly. She said, “I didn’t want to tell you because I thought it would be upsetting hearing about them saying that stuff about you” and my response was “That sounds exactly like them”.
I’m just so glad that someone else got to see it. "
10,Was hoping I wouldn’t have anything to post for a while,ohreallynowlinda,0,88,1005,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536087435.0,9cylvd,"I am writing to you from home state as we have been here a few days now. I am the woman who’s MIL came in my room after I delivered and took my baby to another room and had me and the hospital staff freaking out for a while after I lost my infant daughter two years ago. 

So the current situation had us returning to home state unfortunately. My in laws live in a midwestern state that has had some awful weather recently. My FIL and BIL work construction and were driving in one of their work vehicles during a bad storm. Their truck was was hit head on by another large truck that had hydroplaned. The driver of the other truck was killed instantly and my FIL and BIL were severely injured. BIL we are not sure if he will recover from his injuries as he has not woken up since the accident and FIL is awake but had broken bones and a lacerated liver. He has had a couple surgeries so far to repair the damage. There might be more in the near future. 

Of course hearing this DH and I with our son flew to home state.  MIL is a hot mess. She is trying to stay together and not freak out but I don’t know if she is taking too many meds or not enough or just losing her freaking mind. She sits in the chair shaking and staring at either FIL or BIL depending on who’s room she is in then gets up and mutters to herself and cries.  I’m sure she is scared to death to lose her husband and her son but I don’t think she is anywhere close to normal. 

I have put aside my issues with her for the moment. I need to be here for DH because he has gone through so much recently. If BIL doesn’t make it DH is going to be lost. His brother is his best friend. We are scared. 

When we arrived at the hospital the first day I had brought son with us because one of DH’s cousins couldn’t get to us yet to pick him up to watch him. We knew it would be an awkward meeting but I wanted to see FIL and BIL too. I love them very much. MIL was waiting for us in the waiting room since we couldn’t take little man into the ICU.  She burst into tears seeing us and nearly toppled DH over with her hug. She looked like she didn’t know what to do with me so she said hello and waved. I’ll give it to her for not trying to jump on me too. I could tell she wanted to take the carrier from me because she wanted to hold little man but she stopped herself. 

She took DH in first then she took me into each of their rooms. FIL was doped up pretty well with a lot bruising but he smiled at me and squeezed my hand. BIL looked nothing like himself with all the tubes and wires. I cried and MIL rubbed my back like we were a normal family. After that cousin took the baby for a while and we talked about prognosis for both. The day after we got not good news on BIL about the swelling in his brain and responsiveness. MIL has now gone we think three days without really eating a whole and only napping here and there. I guess that is probably adding to her craziness. 

She did call at like 2 am last night as we have
Been staying at a friend’s home. She asked if she could see the baby for breakfast. DH told her to go back to sleep or whatever she was doing and don’t call at 2am.  He hung up and confronted her this morning about it.  She says she doesn’t remember calling. He said she looks like she hadn’t slept at all and is running on fumes. So who knows maybe she sleep dialed or something. Or she really is losing her mind. 

I really wish this bad shit would stop. Our little family needs some healing time. "
11,My wife just savagely put my Ndad in his place,McBrideTheHunter,0,286,3044,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1535992311.0,9cmwcu,"Sorry its a bit long:

My dad is the classic 'i make fun of your sorrows and then act offended when you confront me' type of  narcissist. The classic move of his is to make fun of you relentlessly and taunt you, then, when you give it back to him in the smallest way, he ""crumbles"" and acts super hurt and upset and will go on for days about it. 

So my wife and I have a four month old. My dad and my stepmom came over to visit. My wife usually has to help me mentally prepare when he comes over, and this time was no different. We agreed we were not going to deal with the intentionally hurtful way he treats me, the way he treats me more like a ""thing"" as opposed to a human being. 

So, we have a 4 month old and obviously we are incredibly busy with her, and obviously when you have a new baby you have to make many personal sacrifices; hobbies, interests and sometimes friends have to temporarily take a backseat. 

I've been running a Dungeons and Dragons group for several years, we meet every other week. It's a blast, and I enjoy it immensely, and because of that fact my ndad Hates it, and constantly ridicules me. 

During his visit just now, my stepmom (who is genuinely interested in my life) said enthusiasticly ""I was just telling someone about your d&d... How is it going"" 

""I had to stop,"" I said. ""I don't have time anymore.""

My stepmom started to respond, but my ndad cut in saying ""ahhhhh hhaaaaaa.... Ahhhhh hhaaaaaa....it's overrrrrrrr it's overrrrrrrr"" .... Then he starts slowly singing in a high pitched voice ""it's ovvvvvverrrrrrrr it's ovvvvvverrrrrrrr"" 

We all three just stare at him, perplexed. He keeps going. Finally after another 5-10 seconds my wife goes ""what is wrong with you?"" 

My ndad continues 'singing' ""it's ovvvvvverrrrrrrr"" 

My wife shouts over him ""no one thinks you're funny, we just think you're a rude ass"" 

He stop immediately. ""Oh please,"" he says, ""it's all in good fun"" 

""No it's not,"" my wife snaps back, ""you taking pleasure in your son not being to do something he enjoys isn't 'funny'"" 

""Is this like ... A sensitive issue or something?"" My ndad says. ""because you're acting really ...aggressive"" 

""No,"" I say, having courage now to speak up. ""It's just hilarious how happy you are about other people' misfortunes. What are you, in Jr high school?""

""Eat more food,"" my wife says to him. ""So you can keep your mouth shut ""

""Wow,"" he muttered. ""Just another person I have to add to the list of people I can't be myself around. Just aaaaaad it to the list. Just aaaaaad it to the list"" 

For the next hour of the visit he stayed in the kitchen, pouting, sighing, and silent.

12,I will NOT ALLOW that to happen.,gypsybeauty,0,7,25,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536115842.0,9d2chp,"I have been NC with my Nmom for going on 3 years now and she still managed to ruin my vacation. I have been carefully planning a trip home for a wedding with a  separate side of my family. I planned to see my Grandma and Sister the first day I arrived and had asked everyone not to mention it, going so far as to call it a surprise for my grandma so she wouldn't feel pressured to reveal anything. This is where we messed up. My sister added it to my grandma's calendar just as a surprise. Well Nmom saw this and somehow came to the conclusion that it was a visit from me and has determined she will NOT ALLOW that to happen without being present. To ensure this she is taking my grandma to her house for the entirety of my trip (and extra time since she doesn't know the exact dates). I want to yell and tell her how childish that is, how it shows her true colors, and how manipulative and selfish it is to keep a grandmother from her grandchild out of spite. But it will make no difference so I maintain my NC with the greyrock face I developed under her. Onto plan B for visiting Grandma."
13,I let nmom run her mouth and I didn't respond and I feel really proud of myself.,TaliaShae,0,8,26,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536090544.0,9cz20w,"Yesterday nmom and I got into a really heated argument that all started over my lactose intolerance. She claims there's nothing wrong with me (how she would know is beyond me). It escalated to mom yelling with a tone to her voice I've never even heard before, so angry she sounded like a character in a horror movie during an exorcism. I've read all over the place that in her condition (suspected antisocial personality disorder), she doesn't even really know she's doing anything wrong and there very little hope at ""fixing"" her, so I just let her yell. I knew that saying anything would make it worse and there was nothing I could say to make it better. So I just let her go. She was going on for so long I was hoping she might realize that *I'm* not the one with an anger problem that she so intently claims I have.

I wasn't as angry as I thought I would be. Normally, I get so mad that she thinks she's in the right and that I lost the fight but I didn't feel that way this time. I was able to acknowledge that it really doesn't matter how she feels, she's always going to feel the same way about me. I've started to settle with the fact that I have a mom who's simply empty. It's not that I've lost anything, there was just never anything there in the first place. It's a shame that it took me so long to realize how to handle it, but at least it'll be easier to go NC. Idk, just felt like letting that out."
14,CleanFreak: NO PDAs! And why do you never kiss us goodnight?,TheFilthyDIL,0,34,782,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536005970.0,9coucf,"​ETA: This was more than 40 years ago, and CleanFreak is long dead. 

CleanFreak was . . . weird when it came to Public Displays of Affection.  On our first visit there we were still in the newlywed phase, as our second anniversary was still on the horizon.  So we were (and still are) physically demonstrative.  I’m not talking about lap dances and tonsil cleaning, but loving pats and touches and quick kisses.

I was sitting on the couch at the PIL’s house when DH walked past.  I patted him on the butt and he leaned down for a kiss.

CleanFreak hit the ceiling.  “WHY DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BE PAWING AT HIM?!?  **DECENT** PEOPLE DON’T DO THAT IN PUBLIC!!”

Me: “Because we love each other.  My parents still kiss and touch each other all the time.  Don’t you?”  (Incidentally, my parents still affectionately kissed and touched after 70 years of marriage.)

​CleanFreak: “WHERE THE H-E-DOUBLE HOCKEYSTICKS DO YOU COME OFF CLAIMING THAT BECAUSE WE DON’T GROPE EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME, THAT MEANS WE DON’T LOVE EACH OTHER?!?!  THAT WE HATE EACH OTHER?!?”

​I JADEed.  DH JADEed.  I don’t remember any resolution to the “discussion,” if any.  CleanFreak was adamant that I said they must hate each other.

​But the next night, ah, the next night – bedtime came (thank Goddess!) I said goodnight and started to go up the stairs.

​CleanFreak: “Aren’t you forgetting something?”

​Me: “Did I only think that I said goodnight?  Because if I didn’t say it out loud, I apologize. Goodnight.”

​CF: “YOU DIDN’T KISS US GOODNIGHT!!  YOU NEVER DO!! **IS THAT ANY WAY TO TREAT YOUR PARENTS?”**

​Me: ""You aren't MY parents.  And I stopped kissing MY parents goodnight when I was about 10.  I don’t intend to kiss you and Dad, not after that fit you threw yesterday.  GOOD. NIGHT.”  And I went upstairs to bed.  IIRC, she complained loudly about it, but what could she do, other than add to her increasing catalog of Butt-Hurt Reasons to Hate Her Awful DIL?"

A little background, she has a conceal and carry. She has a history of mental illness. No I do NOT let her near our DD. She tried to forcefully grab my Dd from while arms while she was feeding. She tells me I'm ""stealing away her son"". This has been going on for two years. 

I'm pretty sure she just threatened me. I'm not sure if I should go to the police or if I'm over reacting? Her behavior is so unstable right now, she is all over the map. And I am freaking out.

Should I go to the police? Wait for my husband? I can't think right now.

I don't know how much more I can post about this if it goes any further and some sort of legal action is required. Let's hope it doesn't come to that. I still believe in forgiveness and second chances, but she needs professional help before we can have any sort of relationship. Before she sees my child. Doors are locked and she does live far away. My husband is home and completely has my back. I'll try to post the full conversation, I'm not very good at this and the exchange  is long,  so it might take a bit to get it all here. "

Don’t want to get out of bed, even though I didn’t have one and slept on the couch. Hated my job. Never wanted to be home. And for a while I was going to beauty school full time. I started to get very depressed and started missing days which causes future problems school wise(paying for hours missed, pushing back grad date, unsatisfactory attendance etc.)
Sooo I withdrew. I was juggling school tues-fri 9:30-5:30 then straight to work from 6:30-11:30 and a not so great home life. While visiting my long distance bf pretty much every weekend(the only place I can relax and am happy)
So I withdrew while my Nmom was on a cruise, knowing she would be upset. I thought it would help with my mental health. But now, all I hear is “when are you gunna go back to school?” “Do you even have a plan?” And I do. And I’ve said it. A lot. Work, save, move out, day job, night school. Leave me alone. I can’t go to school while living in this house. And now I made the mistake of telling my 33 y/old brother, who still lives at home with no job or anything, this. Now he’s doing it too. “So are you gunna go back to school?” “I think you should, you can’t quit. You’ll end up like me” YES I AM GOING BACK. I’ve said it a million times. It’s what I want to do.

17,How do you deal with narc enablers?,cosmo_kitten906,0,10,26,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536050857.0,9ctu7d,"My dad is ex military, meaning that he missed a lot of my narc mums behaviour as he was often away. He’s left the military for quite a few years now so he’s experienced some of the stuff she’d been doing to my brother and I for years, and I’ve had many breakdowns where I’ve explained what she’s done, but it’s like he refuses to acknowledge it?

Well, that’s not strictly true. My Nmum is also extremely emotionally abusive to my dad, she treats him terribly, they will typically end up in an argument or he just takes the abuse and rants to me about it afterwards. When he does rant to me about it, it’s as if it’s the first time he’s seen her treat someone like that despite the fact he watches her do it to my brother and I all the time. I try to explain to him that the way she is treating him isn’t new and that she’s been like this for years. The thing is that when she does do it to us, he refuses to back us up. He chooses to pick her side, even when it makes absolute no sense.

He’ll tell us that she’s the parent and we must respect that and do what she says. She’s extremely anal about how things get done (they must be done exactly the way she wants it otherwise she has a meltdown and starts a huge  fight) but instead of realising that this behaviour of her is uncalled her, he tells us that we should walk on eggshells, always accommodate to her, basically that we should know better. 

It’s kinda hard to explain it all in a way that makes sense? Here’s an example of what I’m talking about:

My mother frequently accuses me of doing drugs (I don’t drink, I don’t do drugs, I don’t go out late, I have wholesome friends, I’m literally the last person to do drugs) but for some reason I could just be sitting at the table and she’d accuse me of doing drugs. 

One day she showed me a photo of a new sofa she bought and I said it was nice but my response wasn’t good enough so she accused me of not even looking at the picture and made me describe it, obviously since i did in fact look at the picture I was able to describe it and prove her wrong. So she accused me of doing drugs. I was clearly bothered by it and kinda just avoided her and because I was being ‘huffy’ she screamed my dads name to get him to rip into me for her because I was being ‘disrespectful’.

We had a huge family argument over it, i kept explaining that I found it offensive to be accused of taking drugs for no reason, that I had my phone taken off me, been sat down and shouted at, because I was offended of being accused of something. After lots of screaming and shouting my mum decides to come up with the excuse ‘I was only joking’

Now we ALL know she wasn’t joking but my dad decides to jump on the excuse with her, backing her up and telling me repeatedly that it was just a joke, all fun and bants. I fully broke at that point and told him that I was oh so glad that we was able to knowingly lie to me to avoid going against my mum. He didn’t say anything. 

I’m so sorry for ranting about it, I can’t seem to come up with a simplified version of what I’m trying to explain? 

So how do you deal with parents that just enable and encourage narc behaviour, forcing you to deal with it the same way they’ve chosen to deal with it, instead of actually addressing it and realising that the narc is wrong."

He seemed as an enabler whole his life (to a quite agressive nmother) but it recent years, he comes out as a true narc himself. 

He told me he cut out my older sister (married, had children, once she left to another country. Since then, and bcs of that, ""she betrayed them"".  she's a great daughter, very successful and nice human being. Many parents would adore having a child like that). She is also VVVLC with them. If she hadn't done that, believe me she could have never live her life as she intended to. 

I asked him how can he say that for his daughter. It's not normal (although actually it was my sister who cut them off, after giving them a million opportunities to behave as decent parents). His answer - I cut her out, bcs she doesn't call (before that, I was a great father to her, he denies every mistreatment or emotional abuse). 

And he asks me why do you care. 
I say, bcs I am also your daughter and it hurts. It hurts my brother too.  Will you cut out us too (when we decide to live our lifes, differently from what you think we should) and stay alone? 

Yes, I will cut you out, all of you. No problem. 

After that I told him not to call me ever again. 
It just came out of my mouth, as a reaction.

19,"Is there any medication which can help you deal with a toxic person, being less emotionally reactive to their skilled manipulation?",is_reddit_useful,0,3,2,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536114627.0,9d26xt,"I've noticed that the NMDA antagonist dissociative drug dextromethorphan (DXM) or even just a beer blunt the emotional effects of my mother's behaviour. That makes me more able to react intelligently instead of being drawn into drama in an unhelpful way. That seems better for me, and even seems better for her, because she doesn't get rewards which reinforce bad behaviour.

However, this self-medication is probably not a safe strategy for continuous use on a long term basis due to dangers of addiction and/or damage.

So, I wonder: can any medication make dealing with a toxic person easier? I'm not asking about self-medication, but about options I could discuss with a general practitioner doctor or psychiatrist."
20,Just a little vent piece on a NDad,throwaway351651,0,1,3,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536107704.0,9d1cnp,"I never know how to preface these posts, so I'm just gonna jump in.



My childhood was just a series of ""you're going to grow up homeless,"" ""you'll be just like your mother,"" ""where you're heading you'll be a prostitute on the streets by 18."" Most of this was a result of him being unhappy with my average (C's) grades. Math was one of my worst subjects growing up, no matter what grade I was in, I couldn't understand it.

I was eligable for special classes (there's a possibility I'm Autistic. Most of the family seems to think so) but Dad completely shot them down. According to him, the problem wasn't that I was ""stupid,"" it was that I was lazy and just never applied myself. He'd turn me down when I asked if I could get tutoring, completely refused to help me with homework, and even instructed whoever his girlfriends were at the time to not help me. It's like he just expected me to be a straight A student, but was appalled by the very notion that I couldn't just achieve that naturally.

I was always being put down or compared to. When I was 13 (14?), my dad once told his girlfriend, right in front of me, that his oldest son was the only one of his kids he's ever been proud of. Albeit, he was blackout drunk at the time (he's an alcoholic.) Not sure if that makes it better or worse. I distinctly remember him telling me once that he would hate me if I weren't his daughter. Many times he's told me he wasn't surprised that I didn't have friends. I've been called stupid more times than I could count, been told to fuck myself once, was accused of having a creepy father-complex a few times (this one completely floored me, since it was in response to me saying I didn't want to have to hear him having loud, screaming sex everynight at 14 years old. His room was just a very thin wall away from mine).

One time, when I was 15, I told him I wanted to kill myself. He completely blew a fuse, told me every woman whose ever told him that was just looking for attention. I was sent to my room and grounded for a week. Even to this day, despite being hospitalized when I was 17 due to chronic suicidal tendencies, he denies that I even have depression. He made a habit of hiding my antidepressants from me and even stole most of my bottles and locked them in his closet. I now live many states away from him and he still refuses to hand over my meds. I still remember him sitting me down and guilt-tripping me into watch an anti-medication movie (ProzacNation) with him to try to sway me away from the meds.

I'm 19 now. I've hit a stage in our relationship where I just refuse to talk to him, every conversation we had was just him telling me I'm gonna be a sex slave or a prostitute when I hit 25. There's a lot of bitterness. I dwell a lot on where I'd be right now if I was raised by a normal father. I know that man loves me, and I know he feels at least a sliver of guilt over the way he treated me. I've never gotten an apology, though. And that's what really stings."

22,We didn’t tell JNMIL we were in town visiting (purposefully).... obviously she found out....,littlebritney,0,101,211,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536037206.0,9csl2n,"So this weekend we went back home (we moved away 2 years ago same with other siblings) and we didn’t tell her because in the last two years, we always have to see her when we make a trip back. It’s been very taxing on us because she monopolizes our time and cries. 

So DH and I have made it a point to make trips for specific reasons, like family functions or to see specific ppl, so we don’t get caught in JNMIL monopolizing trap. This time, we were back for friends.

She found out we were in town. She texted and said “had no idea you were here let’s meet up if you can.... but if you’re busy I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND :) “.

So naturally we dodged that bullet and told her we’d see what we could do but we didn’t think we’d make it to her place this visit (which is cool cause we literally saw her last weekend we rented a cottage with her and spent all our time with her). 

Anyways I’m sure you can guess what happened. She texted me the day we were leaving and was super bitchy that we didn’t see her. I tried to no JADE but apparently I’m bad at actually knowing how to do that... told her “you said you understood so I don’t know where this is coming from” and “if it makes you feel better we didn’t stop in to see my own mother either!”

Needless to say. She lost her shit.

This all stemmed because my SIL’s mom asked us to go for coffee over fbook, which is how JNMIL found out about us being there in the first place and she was mad we made time for SILs mom but not her ... but as I mentioned we just spent an entire weekend with JNMIL.

My SIL said we should cancel with her mom and go see JNMIL.... I said absolutely not.!!! That’s what she wants. And if she thinks I’m going to completely change my plans for her because she pitches a fit (old behaviours) well she’s wrong.

I’m so tired of her. If we tell her we are in town she expects a visit. If we lie, we always get caught and she freaks. If we are 100% honest and say “we are here but we aren’t seeing you” she’s pissed that we isolated her. ....In two years I’ve been to see her EVERY SINGLE VISIT. It would be different if she just let us pop in, but nooooooooooo!!! She always has to monopolize our time when we are there. If we make plans to spend 2 days with her and 1 day with others she cries and is like you never make time for me, which prevents us from seeing my family and our friends.

I know the approach could have been better. But there is literally no winning with her. NO MATTER WHAT we do, if we don’t devote all our attention to her when we visit, she’s mad."

Am I being dramatic or is that bullshit."
24,Parents making me feel lost and anxious in college,Vanilla_Vaporeon,0,1,0,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536119678.0,9d2t2u,"My life is extremely stressful right now as I am preparing for my senior art show in 2 months. However, its getting a worse recently thanks to my parents (divorced for about 10 years now) making their problems into my own problem. My ndad is trying to be a better and sends me money so I don't have to work while in school. I am very grateful for it. But recently I was forced to move out of my apartment because of a bad roommate. My mom offered for me to move back home with her and my little sister until I graduate this semester, and my dad therefore started giving me less money because he does not want my mom having any of it. 

The problem here is.....  I have only been here at my mom's about 4 months and I think she is already trying to get me to move back out since she is not getting any money from my dad through me.

1) First she started off complaining about my ferrets stinking up the room. They really don't smell bad because I clean their cage often, but I went ahead and bought a nice air purifier so everyone would be happy. She says she likes them now but I feel like she is lying. 

2) Her next complaint was about how I am never home, and not to treat her house like a storage unit. I do stay at my boyfriend's place every weekend, but she agreed before that was totally fine with her since I am an adult and she goes to her boyfriend's place too. Now that they broke up, I feel like she gets all butthurt when I come home after I spend all weekend with my boyfriend, even though I am mostly spending it working hard for my art show anyway.

3) She also keeps regularly asking when me and my boyfriend will ever graduate and get ""real jobs"". She has a habit of bragging about her new life as a nurse and how much money she makes, but then will tell me about how much she hates it the next day and misses being a stay at home mom. Thing is, one day she will praise me for being an artist and wanting to make a living for myself, but the next she feels the need to tell me about how my bf and I won't ever make enough money.

4) Another issue we have is our conflicting opinions about my bf I have been with for 3 years now. She has told me a long time ago that he is not who she would choose for me, and my grandpa once threw a fit about him having long hair and that I should date anyone else but him. We worked it out, and we all get along now (or so I thought). It drives me crazy because now she will say she likes him a lot, but then will test me and make sure we are not wanting to get married. If I even mention my best friend who is getting married soon she is like OMG NO. PLEASE NEVER GET MARRIED. Its really confusing for me. She keeps saying she thinks it would be a good idea for me to move into an apartment with my bf soon, and I agree. We actually lived together a year ago with a friend and it was great, but the rent ended up getting too expensive. But as soon as I tell her I agree, she immediately follows it up with... but it will suck for you when you break up oh and doNT EVER GET MARRIED TO HIM AND DONT EVER HAVE KIDS. I never once have mentioned us getting married or having kids. My bf and I have talked about maybe later in the future we could but... not until we have stable jobs at least. Idk if its because she hates him or she is just being cynical about marriage since she has been divorced many times.

5) She also complains about me eating all her food. I really don't mind going and buying my own groceries, but I get really confused because she has been expecting me and my sister to make dinner sometimes before she comes home. There was one night I was cleaning everyone's dishes, and she started getting on to me, saying how I do nothing and don't contribute to anything in the household. I listened, until it escalated into how she barely has enough child support for my sister since my dad got married to his stupid girlfriend recently and I walked away. But its really not like eat their food all the time. I honestly need to eat better because I am too skinny. I eat breakfast sandwhiches she said I could have but thats about it. I get subway or whatever food I can at school.

6) On a final note, she just now told me she is selling a lot of her expensive furniture to get newer expensive stuff. I said I would take it after I move out when I graduate. But then she said it will be sold before then. So basically I have to move within the next month if I want the furniture. She followed it up by saying she isn't trying to pressure me into moving, but I don't know that I believe that. I then stupidly started stressing out both myself and my bf out about if we should go ahead and move right now. He thought I was mad at him and I feel bad. He can't move right now, but maybe I still could if my dad would give me the amount of money I was getting before again?

I'm not really sure what to do anymore. I'm already stressed out with school, and now its just getting worse with my parents only thinking about themselves... Would moving out as soon as possible be the right thing to do even though I am trying to focus on school? Or should I stay until I graduate and put up with my mom and having less money from my dad? Overall I'm just really lost and I noticed my anxiety I thought I had a grip on a year ago after seeing a therapist is getting worse...

What should I do?",sammydawn15,0,386,2731,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536016994.0,9cq9ve,"(I posted this a couple days ago in the relationship advice page. Recieved a lot of good advice, but multiple people said I should post here too. Just had to wait until the weekend was over because I havent decided yet if I want to share this with my husband, and I would like to reply to as many comments as I can.) 

Bare with me, as this is my first post and could end up being very long to provide all the info.. now that I've finished typing out the post, it is very long, so sorry! I didnt want to leave anything out 

The incident/backstory:
Back in April of this year, my husband[23], my daughter[2], and myself[23] were visiting with his parents at their house. My in laws went against our request that they not give our daughter Slim Jim's. By the time the conflict started, she had already had 3. I was fed up with them not listening, so I picked up my daughter and demanded to my husband that we leave. He and I exchanged a few words. As I was getting my shoes on, my father-in-law picked up my daughter and walked off into the living room with her. While holding her he started yelling at me. I approached him and demanded that he give me my daughter so I could leave. He refused. I reached out for her and he turned away. Again refusing to give me my child. I reached around him to try to get her. He turned his back to me and kicked me in my lower stomach, so hard it caused me to pee on myself, knowing that I was 16 weeks pregnant at this time. At this point I was completely terrified. I got up and begged them to give me my daughter so I could leave. He handed her to my mother-in-law. I tried to get her from MIL but she was squeezing her so tightly that I was afraid of hurting my daughter if I forced her out of MILs grip. She shoved me back and FIL grabbed me and slung me down into the recliner, then began choking me. My husband pushed him off of me. I got up and grabbed my cell phone, attempting to call 911. FIL hit me in the face and took my cell. I ran into the kitchen to try and use their house phone to call 911. He chased me down and took that phone, destroyed it. I ran back and pled for MIL to give me my daughter. She refused. At this point I saw FIL throw my phone outside into the yard. I went after it to try and find it so I could call the police, but I couldnt. They locked me out of the house. I waited for what felt like forever for my husband to finally come out with my daughter. We left. I called the police. DVPs were filed, and charges pressed. 

Fast forward to now, I ended up agreeing to drop dvps and charges because they had charges filed on us too and said if I dropped mine they would drop theirs. (Small town-they had every in with the justice system in their county). There were many reasons I agreed to drop everything, the expenses of legal aid, the mental toll, the endless stress it would have caused me during my already high-risk pregnancy, and my main reasoning to protect my husband from possibly having domestic battery conviction, although he did nothing, his mother had him arrested.  I agreed to drop the charges under the promise and understanding from my husband that our family was going to cut ties with my in-laws and I would not have to worry about myself or my children being around them ever again. 

It's been about four months since this happened and only about one month since all the legal processes concluded. I'm currently 36 healthy weeks pregnant with my second daughter. My 2 year old has seeming recovered from the trauma pretty well, but still has obvious anxieties over loud talking or physical contact-even play fighting. 

The problem at hand:
Recently my husband has begun speaking to his parents again and visiting them as well. They are sending gifts for my children and offering help with groceries, bills, etc. Even though it's not what we agreed on, I've tried to be as understanding as I can be because they are his parents. So we fought and fought over it, and I finally agreed that yes he could speak to them if that was what he needed to get us to a point where it wasnt going to ruin our marriage. A week or two passes and we start to fight over our children being around them. I dont think they deserve to have my children in their lives ever. He wants our girls to have a significant relationship with them. Eventually I agree that yes IN TIME, and I specified that it would not be within the next year, as I need time to heal from what happened, I would allow our daughters to spend time with them in public settings only, never in their private home, under my supervision. This was agreed upon. Another short amount of time has passed by and hes already asking to take our 2 year old to their house to visit them. Hes made comments about taking our yet to be born daughter to see them too.

What I need help/advice with:
I've given as much as I can mentally handle, any more and it would be completely unfair to what I need and what I think is best for our children and their safety.. So I've refused to budge anymore. Though things are at a cooldown phase right now, I'm afraid that this will eventually turn into another month of misery and fighting or longer because I just can not give in anymore. I dont want to lose my husband.. I dont want my marriage to fall apart because I wont give in to what he wants again. Is there anything I could do to make this work? Is there any way I can show him that I've done enough? How can I fix this? Is there a way I can protect my children from these people and save my marriage? Am I in the wrong? Have I done enough? 

Thanks to anyone who has made it through the whole post. Any and all advice or input is welcomed, rather you agree with me or not. I just want to understand what I need to do or what I could do to make this easier on my family and still keep my children safe. I dont really have anyone to talk to about this. Thanks for listening!

28,Narcissist are like hurricanes. They must be the center of the attention and careless the damage they bring upon others.,nv1793,0,2,6,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536067736.0,9cvlsa,
29,Is this... guilt-tripping? Or am I in the wrong? I don't even know anymore.,toxik0n,0,7,9,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536090254.0,9cz0fs,"I've always considered my parents fairly normal and nice people. They got divorced about 10 years ago, and since then, my dad has been dating a woman. This lady is 100% a narcissist and she's honestly a nightmare to deal with.

But I'm more wondering about my dad. Our relationship has been strained since he started dating this woman and I feel like most of our interactions are him guilt-tripping me. They both seem to place a lot of importance on favours and returning favours. If a favour isn't returned with similar commitment, I get guilted. They both act like selfless martyrs (especially the woman) - except they always expect something in return.

I'm a 30-year old adult, and yes, maybe I don't visit my family enough. I have a full-time job, a husband and two dogs. I barely see my friends once a week, let alone my family. My dad and his partner seem to take this as a personal slight.

When I do see my dad a couple times a month, there are always little, subtle guilt-trippy comments about how I don't visit often enough. Or how I don't do this or that. Usually kind of a ""woe is me"" attitude. He can be very mopey, especially since dealing with an ongoing medical issue the past couple years. 

Our relationship is usually okay, if not slightly strained by the psycho woman he's with, but sometimes he says shit that just makes me want to go no-contact.

For example, I received this text yesterday:

""It was grandma's birthday yesterday. She turned 91. It's not too late to call her and wish her a happy birthday. None of the grandkids called. She would appreciate it.""

Reading it just gave me such a mix of emotions. At first I felt guilty that I missed my grandma's birthday. And I ended up going to visit her today.

But now that I think about it more, it strikes me as so damn passive aggressive. Like my dad chose to text me AFTER her birthday just so he could lay on the guilt. 

Why not text me the day of her birthday and say ""Hey, it's grandma's birthday and I'm heading over there to visit, wanna join me?""

Isn't that the normal thing to do? Or am I just a rude, oblivious person overthinking things?"
30,MIL has baby rabies update: it's all my fault,blanketburritos,0,54,722,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1535980955.0,9clfk0,"After my last post, my MIL had more things to say re: grandbaaaabies.

DH said something about the way she punished him when he was a teenager, mentioning a time he got grounded for a long time. She denied it, then said he made it up, then said if it did happen he deserved it, then said:

MIL: Well, I insist you have three or four kids! Then we'll see how the stories change!
Me: ...I don't think you can insist that.
MIL: I can say it!
Me: Yeah, rudely!

There was also a conversation about how she and FIL don't have to put the grandkids to bed on time, and SIL was saying that if MIL & FIL don't follow the rules, SIL will find a new person to babysit. FIL (since MIL was away) kept insisting she wasn't being serious. I guess he was kidding? But I said: ""Grandparents who don't follow the rules have to go into grandparent time out.""

At dinner, just me, DH, SIL, and BIL (DH's brother & SIL's husband), I expressed my frustrations with how MIL acts and the things she says. I brought up the thing I posted about on Saturday, how she wants SIL to go into early labor so MIL will have time to bond with ""her baby.""

They all defended her. SIL said that's just how she is (hah) and it isn't how she meant it. BIL says I'm making an assumption about her intentions and I'm assuming the worst. DH stayed silent but kind of nodded along with them.

I tried to defend myself, but they just kept saying MIL doesn't mean it the way I'm taking it, so I should just.... not take it that way? Like it suddenly becomes not rude if I'm not paying attention?

It made me feel crazy. If it doesn't bother anyone else, should it bother me? I don't have kids so I'm (generally) not subjected to the brunt of MIL's craziness, and I'm fully ready to say they can't babysit whenever the time comes. 

I'm here for like thirty more hours so I may have more to say tomorrow. Send help.

PS - MIL and FIL are on the phone with FIL's mom right now to wish her happy birthday, and she's guilting them about not calling earlier. It's 9:20am. Crazy MIL runs in the family."

The grocery store? No, you have to come along. The doctor's? You're going to sit and wait for me. Their job? Dragged unwillingly and having nothing to do at all.

Before my sister passed, she once told me about how when we were young our NDad decided to bring **ALL** of us with him on a delivery job he had to do. The destination was apparently one of the most racist counties here in our state so he decided to have us go with him. She remarked that while its understandable to be scared to go to such a place by yourself, having your entire family with you is absolutely foolish. 

To this day if he has somewhere to go and if my mom is off coincidentally, he'll **expect** her, not ask, to go with him or one of us has to do it. Like a child who can't leave home without their favorite blanket. "

33,Darth Potter has returned,Peppermint_Panda88,0,24,430,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536001743.0,9co989,"It's been just over one very blissful, quiet, drama-free month since we went NC with Darth Potter. Maybe she's changed, maybe she's learning to respect our boundaries. Or maybe she was just waiting for the perfect moment to crash back into our lives. And maybe, just maybe, she decided that perfect moment was yesterday, during my best friends baby shower.

That's right llamas! Darth Potter crashed a baby shower! But at least it's a shower for people she's friends with right? Wrong! She's met this couple once, and afterwards let everyone know how ""disgusting"" they were in ""the eyes of the lord"" because in Darth Potter's mind if you're gay then you're damned, unless you're on Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. 

How'd she even get in you ask? Poor shitty timing! See, I realized pretty late into setting up  that we wouldn't have enough food, and so took it upon myself to leave and get more. I knew I would be getting back after the party started, but as my bestie said, ""It's not like anything happens at the beginning of a party! "" 

Oh, how I wish the Fates had given us a sign when he spoke those words! But there was no clap of thunder, no foreboding music, the sky was clear, Hans Zimmer was on vacation, and so I left for Trader Joe's. 

SIL was supposed to be my plus one, but was also sick. Darth Potter and SIL have very similar names. Darth Potter also looks much younger than her acutal age. So when she shows up and says she's my plus one, my friends didn't question it.

And so, when I returned with food, Darth Potter was there, joyfully announcing that her ""daughter"" had finally arrived, while simultaneously apologizing to everyone for how rude I was for being late. Then she dragged me over to meet the surrogate, whom I've known for 4 years now and started yammering on about how wonderful it is to spend time together. 

Now, I could have done the polite thing, and played along so I didn't cause a scene. I also could have caused a scene, could have yelled at her to leave. I was angry enough to do that. Instead, I just turned around and walked away. I went outside, called SFIL, and told him he had 20 minutes to come collect his wife before the NC policy extends to the entire family. He sounded really surprised at where she was, and looked pretty angry when he showed up to get her. Turns out Darth Potter told him that she was covering a shift at work, even left in her uniform to sell the act before making her way over here. 

Darth Potter, being a 55 year old toddler, threw a tantrum because I ""tattled"" and had to literally be carried kicking and screaming out of the house. I ignored her. I ignored her while she was shouting about wanting to stay. I ignored her while she was unceremoniously dumped in the car. I ignored her while she was angrily insulting everyone who looked her way. I ignored her while telling SFIL to drive safe and I ignored her as they drove off. 

I said nothing to her because the moment I saw her standing in my friend's living room, I realized that everything Darth Potter does is for attention. It's what keeps her going, it's the only thing that gives her life meaning. Everything from Christmas dinner to a strangers baby shower has to be about her, because if people are focused on her then they care about her, and if that attention ever stops then she'll be alone. And while some of the stunts she pulled yesterday were beyond the pale, if I acknowledge them by speaking to her, then she wins. But if I don't acknowledge her, she doesn't win, she doesn't lose. She simply cease to exist in my world, and I get to go on living my life.

I'm having a weirdly emotional day, so I guess what I'm trying to say is thank you. Thank you for reading my stories. Thank you for showing me I'm not alone. And thank you for giving me some great advice on how to deal with the JustNo's in my life, both by actually giving advice, and by telling me your stories. I know Darth Potter will be coming back at some point with another grand scheme to reenter our lives, and I know one embarrassing moment isn't enough to make her reconsider her approach. But I also know that if I ever need help, you guys will be here for me.

I'll keep you guys updated, and tomorrow you llamas will get to hear about everything Darth Potter did before I showed up. From what i heard, it was one crazy ride. But I've rambled on long enough for now.

TL;DR: Darth Potter decides to show up to a baby shower she wasn't invited to. I kept my cool and instead of engaging called SFIL to collect her. Also feeling a lot of love for this subreddit."

Have you been an active user for a year or so, and would like to help make this sub a better place? We have an opportunity for you! We are looking for some people who would like to be trained to be an RBN mod.  Specifically, we are looking for people who care deeply about this community and the support that it offers and would like to help the team develop it and keep it safe.  We are not looking for folks who just want another badge. 

You can spend as much time as you like helping keep this community safe for abuse survivors.  If you have 20 minutes a day, that's a huge help!  If you have 2 hours a day, that's great, too!  It's all up to you!

As this is a huge subreddit, we understand that jumping right in can be stressful. That is why we are looking for people who would like to (start out or) be mini-mods. What’s a mini-mod, you may ask? Well, we are looking for mini-mods to do one or both of the following:

**Flair Control** - As a flair mod, your sole responsibility would be to go through our unmodded links, and confirm or apply the proper flairs according to guidelines. We have automoderator tag according to key words, but as it’s a robot that can’t understand context, it’s not always right. Many people do not apply flairs or do not know how to apply flairs as well (which is absolutely fine!) as this mod would help with that.

**Auto-Mod Queue** - as a queue mod, you would go through our queue and deal with only the items reported by our automoderator. The automoderator will report items based on key words, to confirm context or to alert us to possible drama or someone who needs extra support. As far as user reports go, you will not be responsible for this, as we will handle this.

Mini-mods are not given full mod permissions immediately, as with most jobs there is a probationary period to ensure that the new team member is an appropriate fit for the sub (acts appropriately, follows the mod rules/guidelines, etc.). Generally training takes one to two months for mini-mods but that depends on the individual, the time they can commit to the volunteer position, how much material is covered and how the senior mods feel about the trainee's progress.

If you'd like to be promoted to a full-mod eventually, that is something you can work towards.  If you would like to stay a mini-mod, that is just fine, too!  It's up to you.  

However, there is one bit that is no longer optional.  **Availability on Discord for text chat only (never video) is required.**  It doesn't mean that you must be on Discord all day or that you must answer any message to you on Discord instantly.  It just means that you should be able to check in with Discord periodically (at least a few times a week) to get updates from the other mods about what is going on and for training assignments, etc.  

I also want to be honest about what this job entails.  It is reading a lot of triggering content.  It is seeing the truly dark side of RBN that our general members never get to see, because we try to remove all that B.S. before our members have to read that nonsense.  It can take an emotional toll, but it is also rewarding.  The thank you notes that we occasionally get from members are nice.  The posts that thank the mods because the group saved their life... those are nice, too.  

If modding sounds like a good job for you, fill out the form linked below and it will be reviewed ASAP! Successful applicants will be contacted by a mod of /r/raisedbynarcissists some time in the future (sorry, no time line available at this point).

35,I created a throwaway to tell you about my crazy MIL,JNMILThrowaccount,0,3,6,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536155734.0,9d6rpx,"Hey all, I love this sub and lurk using my regular account all the time, but I hesitate to post with it because my DH has a dozen siblings and the likelihood of one of them finding my posts is not negligible.


I'm going to post stories one at a time in no particular order, because you can't fit all the crazy in one post. I'll start with one of her more egregious acts, which, true to JNM style, occurred at my wedding in the early 2010's. I should also note that we have been NC with MIL for just over 2 years now due to my DH being fed up with her verbal abuse, so these are just memories and fortunately not things that we continue to deal with.


TL;DR : MIL wants all her friends at wedding, throws fit when we say no. MIL doesn’t want to fork out cash for BIL8 and BIL9 to attend bachelor party and insists they stay home, throws fit when we say no. GC BIL8 breaks up with gf before wedding, throws fit at bachelor party, MIL shows up at bachelor party to comfort BIL8. MIL shows up in a gutted couch of a dress, CBF’s over not being the center of attention, then bullies me into letting BIL8’s ex-gf come halfway through the reception so BIL8 can propose to her on stage.

.

Okay, on to the story. DH and I were quite young when we got married, fresh out of college, high-school sweethearts, all that. Since neither of our parents were paying for the wedding (which we didn't expect them to, but it does mean that they get no say in planning), we were being quite selective with our guest list, since catering is a huge portion of the expense. Since DH has so many siblings, with all their spouses and children, they had already taken up about half of the guest list so we weren’t inviting any extended family we weren’t close with. We still wanted to invite some of OUR friends as well as our families. Of course MIL throws a fit because we won't turn this into a party for MIL and invite everyone she's ever known. 

.

Then when it came to the bachelor party, my brother, DB, who we're both very close with, was planning it with the usual club-hopping, strip club, limo, etc. Nothing extravagant but it would cost each of them roughly $100 to participate (drinks, share of the limo, food). Since DH's two youngest brothers (BIL8 and BIL9 - I told you there were a lot of them) were (and still are) deadbeats who still live with MIL and get all their spending money from her, she called up DB (don't even know how she got his number) to yell at him about how much the bachelor party cost, and couldn't they just have drinks at our house instead of going out? DB just said ""yeah... no. They don't have to come if they don't want to."" and hung up on her crazy ass mid-tantrum.


The night of the bachelor party, they’re having some drinks at our house before heading out and BIL8 (who is 21) has a meltdown because he’s broken up with his 17 y/o fiancée a couple weeks ago and he’s drunk and “heartbroken”. (They dated for like 3 months) He’s just blubbering and getting out of hand and calls his mommy to come calm him down. So my MIL shows up at our house (literally one of the 2 times she’s been to our house in 6 years) to calm down her GC BIL8. DH and company are having none of his theatrics and continue having drinks in another room while he cries to mommy. DB goes up to MIL and says that the limo is on its way, and they’re leaving with or without him.

.

The day of the wedding, MIL shows up in a hot-pink, off-the-shoulder, 80’s style embroidered polyester number that looked like an awful couch met a hiliter. SIL3 showed up in a silver strapless plunge club-dress and giant stilettos. Her 12 y/o daughter kept telling her to fix her dress throughout the day. I said nothing. MIL spends the whole reception CBFing because her whole family is not front and centre in front of the head table, and because we paid her little attention throughout the day (being busy, you know, having a wedding). 

.

At the reception, BIL8 gets a genius idea, he gets his mommy to accompany him to come ask me if he can invite ex-gf, even though she was removed from the guest list when they broke up weeks before. I said she wouldn’t have a seat, he says that’s fine she’s not off work until after dinner. So I caved because I didn’t want to deal with a MIL tantrum and said fine, whatever, if she wants to come dance after dinner that’s fine. She showed up later in her work uniform. Then, BIL8 gets an even MORE genius idea, he wants to propose, right then. I assume this was planned in advance because he had the ring she’d given back to him with him. He approaches my MOH, who is tipsy and flirting with the bartender (it’s late in the evening, you do you girl) and asks her what she thinks. Bless her, she looks at him and says “That’s a f*cking stupid idea. Don’t do that.” and goes back to flirting with the bartender.  Since he didn’t get the “Awww! How sweet!” reaction he was expecting, he goes and gets his mommy again to come ask me.

.

Guys, this is where I screwed up. I should have put my foot down, but I was so stressed about one of these idiots ruining this day and throwing a drunken tantrum that I hadn’t eaten all day. I should have laughed in his face. He asks me if he can propose to ex-gf, MIL in tow, giving me the “You’d better say yes or I’m gonna lose my shit” look. I just said, “I can’t deal with this, ask DH.” and walked away because I honestly couldn’t handle the crazy. Of course they go to DH and say that I said it was fine. 

.

So, ladies and gents, la pièce de résistance : the proposal.


BIL8 gets the mic, gets on stage, and asks for everyone’s attention. You could hear a pin drop. Everyone is alternating looking at him and at me incredulously. I just stand near the back of the room, stone-faced. I can’t even. He asks her to marry him, she says yes. Everyone awkwardly claps. The evening proceeds. Throughout the remaining hour or so of the reception, people approach me asking if I’m OK, commenting on how ridiculous that was and how much of an ass he made of himself, and also informing me that they’d had a screaming match outside not an hour earlier, which was witnessed by a number of guests who were outside smoking.

.

They broke up again, for the final time, the following day. Then, two weeks later, BIL8 gets her name tattooed on his chest as a romantic gesture. THEN, when that didn’t work, he got drunk and tried to remove it with a lighter. That didn’t work and he had to get it covered up.

.

And that, my llamas, is the story of how my in-laws dumped their crazy all over my wedding.

She has been hard to deal with and criticizes me about my hair, my clothing preferences, questioning my tattoos, and what she deems genuine and from the heart ( to make a long story short). Well my mom is flying out here to come visit me as i have moved states to be here. When my bf and i went to tell his parents they both seemed cold and unwelcoming that my mom was coming to visit. The mother kept quiet (fluttering her eyes and rolling them) as my boyfriend introduced that my mother is coming Friday for a week. I smile in total excitement as i haven’t seen my mother in 5 months! But quickly seen my mother in law not so happy to hear the news.  The father in law says “well i won’t be around much because i work. “ which i found odd because we already know that. The mother in law? Said absolutely nothing and let FIL speak. Also , after that awkward convo was over MIL called BF and asked him why I didn’t introduce that my mother was coming over. Just thought it was pretty weird because we both didn’t think it was a big deal who said what. We both were present and my BF decided to take the lead. I don’t understand why they would be so cold about my mother coming. I guess i expected more "
38,General clinginess and GPS tracking,arkhamdovahkiin,0,110,51,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536081307.0,9cxosi,"Hey everyone, I’ve lurked for a while and am posting for the first time about my FMIL. For the most part, we get on really well and she is (mostly) JustYes. However there is just one thing that bugs me and it’s that she is quite clingy!

Me and my SO are both 19 and at university (starting 2nd year next month) and have been together for 2 years and although she’s gotten a bit better since we got together, FMIL is very clingy. My SO is her eldest child and she doesn’t like to let him go anywhere without knowing and if possible supervising/accompanying him. 

For example, she insists she take him to his doctors appointments and any time he has even a slight cold she will act as if he is dying. This one bugs me because a few months ago I went to A&E (emergency room) from midnight til 10am for abdominal pain and she did not accompany me (we were staying with them) or ask me if I am okay (FFIL and SO took me). 

In comparison, for the 1st year of our relationship SO and I were long distance, and she forbade me from visiting on a planned trip once because SO was “very ill” (he had sniffles,  not even a cold) so she could look after him. 

When we moved to uni halls last September she did not like this change at all and insisted we come to see them every single weekend. I didn’t mind this that much, it was nice to see them and their cats, but we couldn’t go more than a week and a half without a call saying we *need* to visit. 

The problem I wanted advice on is the Life360 app, which is a family tracking app. My FSIL is 15, so it makes sense for her to be on it, but SO doesn’t need to be tracked and it notifies her every time we leave university. 

Once, she phoned in a hurry at 7PM asking where we were going because it notified her (we were just going grocery shopping...) and she acted as if we had no business being outside this “late”!

This Sunday we move into a studio flat in a different area of London and I don’t want it to be on the tracking app. I’ve tried asking my JustYes FFIL and he said it’s just how she is and I “won’t understand” until I’ve had my own children, as if this is how all mothers are. 

My own mum is very JustYes and does not track me or ask where I am going; she is much more easygoing and less overbearing.

My mum lives 3 hours away vs my FMIL living ~30 minutes away from us, so we’re hardly very far from my SO’s family (which I could maybe use as justification for tracking him if we were very far away). 

It just feels like FMIL won’t let SO grow up: I really like and get on with her 90% of the time but on the topic of my SO she will not budge on being overbearing and trying to micromanage his life. 

If anyone has any advice on how SO or I can broach the topic of asking not to be tracked with her without making her upset or feeling attacked (I don’t want to make her feel bad) I’d love to hear it. 

TL;DR - my boyfriend and I live together while at university and my FMIL insists on knowing where he is at all times via a tracking app. What can we do about this?

—————————

EDIT: My SO and I had a proper conversation about this, why he thinks it’s not a problem to be tracked, why he doesn’t think he needs his own independence etc and he’s admitted that it’s how he was raised but that he wants to get out of it because he wants to have a life with me and he knows that he needs to be an independent adult for this to happen. Tomorrow he is going to sit down and talk to his mum about the app and his decision to delete it. Upon my saying that I didn’t want this turned on me, as if I “made him” say this (as we all know MILs tend to do...) and he said that he refused to have this turned on me and will not let his parents place this blame on my shoulders. 

Fingers crossed that this doesn’t end in an explosive argument, but I’m happy that my SO is going to stand up for me and for himself. "
39,CryBaby is...Done?,BlueBee773,0,42,533,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536010583.0,9cph24,"Good news, llamas! DD’s first birthday (end of August) has officially come and gone with no real, direct drama from CryBaby. I know it’s not the nom-filled update it could have been, but I’ve never been so content to have nothing major to report. 

DH and I had canvassed possible contact attempts beforehand, having decided after CryBaby tried badmouthing us to my GM that we would not be offering an olive branch in the name of DD’s birthday, and discussed how we would respond to each if they happened, but nothing. Not a card, not a call, not an attempted visit/party crash. We were left alone. DD’s party was beautiful, DD was happy, and we were both able to just enjoy the day with her. 

Now, that’s not to say that CryBaby’s presence (or lack thereof) wasn’t noticeable; it’s just that it was there in ways that didn’t matter to us anymore. YBIL never responded to DH’s text inviting him down for the party, and AIL/CILs never responded to my invitation on Facebook (didn’t really want AIL there anyway, but couldn’t invite CILs without her). With YBIL, we’ve pretty much accepted that he’s taken his mother’s side, even though there is no need for sides, and that we probably will be/have been cut out by him. As far as the AIL/CILs go, we didn’t figure they’d make the trip anyway, as they live a state over, but we didn’t want to hurt CILs’ feelings or feed the “They’ve cut us all out!” narrative by not at least inviting them. 

So anyway, none of them came, but we weren’t really surprised and honestly probably were able to enjoy the party more because of it. The party started, they don’t show, and we didn’t really think about it again, figuring it was reasons stated above. 

But. Then we got home, I put the girl (who is now one, holy crap!) down for a nap, and we found out what had really happened via our Facebook FMs. CryBaby only posted one thing out of the ordinary on DD’s actual birthday, just a quick, “My beautiful granddaughter is turning one today. Happy birthday, DD!” Nothing life shattering, just standard run of the mill attention seeking/pretending for her public that she still sees her GD. The next day (the day of the party she wasn’t invited to), however, she posted a ton of pictures of a birthday party (cake at home, dinner out) for YBIL, featuring herself, GMIL, AIL, and the CILs and the following caption:

>>Celebrating [BIL’s childhood nickname] early. [BIL’s mid-September birthdate] is right around the corner. 

Hm. So the real reason none of them could come to our DD’s first birthday party wasn’t because of distance, but because they were too busy making that same distance to celebrate YBIL’s birthday instead...half a month early and just coincidentally on the same day as the party for DD? Okay. Good to know where we stand, I guess. 

Honestly, we’re not even mad, but I will own to being surprised. Of all the scenarios we had planned for, her throwing a petty revenge party wasn’t one of them, especially since this woman hasn’t done anything for a birthday for either of her sons—cake, party, dinner, etc.—since DH was 16 and even that one he planned for himself. I mean, she’d send money for a gift, but a party, with dinner, cake, and other people? No. Everything nice that was done for DH’s birthdays since we started college was done by me, and she usually didn’t even show up. Which makes us both believe this was just a case of “They’re throwing a party and not inviting me?! Fine! I’ll throw a party and not invite them, plus steal people from their party to come to mine! That’ll show them!” The cake was even themed for our alma mater’s rival school. And really? The whole thing is just...sad. Because this didn’t effect us at all, if that’s what she was hoping for. 

I’m beginning to wonder if it’s finally over, though. The morning of DD’s birthday, CryBaby apparently changed her profile picture from DD (the pic meant to look like DD eating birthday cake, see bot) to one of herself where she’s trying to look younger (think a different style of makeup, Vogue glasses...oddly enough she looks like DH’s last ex in this pic). Then the day of YBIL’s party, she changed her cover picture from one of DD (the one of her in a “party” dress, see bot) to one of YBIL wearing a birthday hat at the restaurant they ate at for his party. 

So she’s officially scrubbed her page of our DD, which is just not normal considering how much she loves using DD for attention fodder. We haven’t heard from her in over a month, and if there was going to be an extinction burst, I was sure it would have been DD’s birthday. I mean, I know her throwing YBIL a party the same day was definitely spiteful, but it wasn’t something that had any direct or real impact on us at all. Could this be it? Is she really giving up and cutting us out? Because, seriously, DH and I can’t come up with a single downside to her “cutting us out,” only things we no longer have to worry about or deal with. Or do you thinking I’m counting my peaceful, drama-free chicks too early?

40,"My mom brought me out to dinner to trap me into a convo, ended up kicking me out",Chrysantha,0,2,2,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536085042.0,9cy9ix,"This is my first time posting here, but I've lurked and I finally have decided I need to make a post for myself after what happened yesterday.

​

Some preface. I'm a 21 year old college student on sophomore year now. I did start a little late. I've had problems with depression my whole life, so I had motivation problems in high school but I'm beginning to fix everything now by going to a community college and transfer to another 4 year college right after. My nmom isn't responsible for my groceries anymore and has made me begin paying all my bills (including car insurance, phone) so naturally we never go out to eat as my sister and I have to support/feed each other because she says she is done paying stuff for us. She's been indifferent to us, she is divorced and my dad doesn't help, and she goes out and does drugs a lot of the time, since my sister and I were about 15. My sister went off to college a week ago and my mom decided the day before I go back to school to go out to dinner. I apologize if this is rambles and makes no sense.

​

Soon after we order she says that we need to have a talk. She begins it with, ""I know sometimes it feels like I don't love you, and I feel bad that your dad isn't around to help, but listen to what I'm saying."" My room is somewhat messy because I sometimes lack the motivation to even clean it or pick up clothes. I get lazy a lot and I understand why she'd be concerned about my room being a mess and it needs to be cleaned. But it just turned into worse things after that. Of course I knew that something like this was bound to happen. She started to say that I don't have a plan in my life at all and that I'm not doing things adults should be doing. I have been searching for a new job for over a month without luck, because I work and go to school to get by which is fine, gets me out and doing stuff. Naturally since I don't have a job and I commute to school (I'm in CC) the gas gets pretty expensive since its an hour each way so I decided to do online classes this semester as I am very broke and I pay for everything myself. She told me that I'm one step away from quitting school since I'm not actually attending the campus this semester and that I just shut myself out in my room. She compares it to my sister's college, who lives in a dorm, and I tried to explain to her that CC is people trying to get by and do their classes and go home because they are usually working adults with children trying to get their degrees. It's not the same experience. I told her it was to save some money to move out as well, which she then said I never will especially if I don't even have a job right now. She accused me of shutting down and not actually trying to be an adult and that I'm behind. I get very good grades.. I got a grant this semester to pay for my classes, I do try.

I told her I have plans of my future that I haven't discussed with her, since anything I say to her turns into an argument (because it does). She reacts the same way to everything, beginning to get angry as soon as it doesn't go with what she wanted. She just yelled at me, ""I dont understand why you just don't join the army, you're falling so behind everyone else!"" Proceeded to tell me that since I have a roof over my head, that I have no right to complain about anything and that all the money she has goes towards us, which isn't true, and I told her that it isn't because she constantly gets botox on herself and performs surgeries in attempts to stay looking young. I guess I shouldn't have said that because she began to deliberately yell in public at the restaurant and make a scene. I just sat there on my phone because I was so embarrassed. She began to have a fit and tell me that I am ""bitching to some stranger that I play games with"" about her and telling them how much I hate her and how horrible of a mother she is and that I don't find what she's saying important. At this point I was astonished. We never really do anything together and she is super strict in public with my sister and I not to embarrass her, so she began to make a scene and I just didn't know what to do. I just froze. She told me that she refuses to pay my bills this month at all and that I need to find the money by any means necessary to pay her. I told her that I never asked for her help to pay, and that it stresses me out too that I haven't found anything. She told me without her I wouldn't get very far, and that I wouldn't survive on my own. Told her I wish it were that easy, and she told me to find my own house because she's done with this conversation. By the time the food came, it was just silence. I didn't want to eat but I was so hungry that I just did in silence.

I'm sorry if this was long, I just felt trapped and I almost cried in public. I had to sit through the meal with awkward tension. I couldn't just leave, she drove us there. I don't know why I accept these things. I'm sorry if this is long. Even if I tried to leave after being kicked out, I know what type of fit she'd go through so I don't know if I should just go stay with a friend for a while or what."

Under no circumstance are they to leave the school with my children, and we’d prefer they don’t even get to visit them *at* school either. There are only 3 people allowed to leave the school with them and none of them are my parents. My kids know that under no circumstance are they to leave with my parents either. 
There’s no court order but I have to write a letter to be read at a staff meeting. I feel so... icky. Trashy even. But my parents have actually tried to abduct my kids before. (Long story short they took them out for the day and in order for my parents to go home, they had to pass by my house. We allowed it to happen because we figured they’d have no choice but to drop them off going by. My parents pretended that their phones had no signal all day and drove them straight to their house two hours away. I caught on to their ploy before it was done and looked at my husband and said “Get in the car, they are abducting our kids and if we don’t get there first we are calling the cops.” We made it to their house 10 minutes before they did. Man were they pissed... but no more than me and my husband whose children they’d just tried to fucking steal. This was 4 years ago and I’m still fucking livid.)

42,Tsarina and Seniority,partyontheobjective,0,5,40,False,JUSTNOMIL,Monkeys do her dirty work. ,1536106533.0,9d17ei,"So Sunday morning BF and I were enjoying some huevos rancheros. Suddenly Tsarina bursts out in a paranoid rant against North (BEST! j/k) Korea hackers and how badass they are. She was watching some fear mongering pseudo-science show. Now BF actually works IT. Him and me are... a bit into the scene. Needless to say, we know about the thing more than Tsarina.

Now, as I previously mentioned, Tsarina is everything-phobic, but she really dislikes Americans, declaring them all stupid morons who don't know shit. Her words not mine. Apparently, there's a caveat to this. I'm getting there.

So BF took the bait and engaged in the discussion. What happened was, we, but mostly BF, bc she just immediately tries to shoot down everything I say, which just ends with me cackling and walking away, tries to explain to her about how North Korea works, esp regarding nuclear weapons, and hacking. She just doesn't get it. She finally shuts BF up by yelling, ""Shut up, there were some American scientists on the show here and they said so, they're smarter than you!""

BF just shakes his head and decides not to engage in a conversation like this. See, when you engage with a dumdum like Tsarina, they'll drag you to your level and beat you with experience. He opts out.

A couple of minutes pass in silence and huevos rancheros, and I finally crack. In a stage whisper, I tell my BF, ""See? Those damn yanks, morons and retards, the lot of them! Except for those yank scientists on TV, those are always right!""

HO-LEEE SHIIIIIET! Another Tsarina tantrum, 9 out of 10, would defy her worldview and logic again.

She howls like a banshee. ""YOU LITTLE SHIIIIIIIIITSSSSSSS!!!!"" Oh shit, death is encroaching over the household. ""I'M OLDER THAN YOUUUUUUUU!!!!"" Ben síde sat on the roof of our house. ""YOU HAVE  NO EXPERIENCE!!!! NO SKILLS! NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD!!!!!"" 

For a moment there, we both thought she's yelling at the TV, which started to proclaim some wild ideas. BF calmly asks, 'I'm sorry, is that to us or the TV?""

""YOOOOOOUUUUU!!!!"" Fuck banshee, she's la Llorona. She slithers to the floor and proceeds to pound her fists against her stupid white leather couch. ""I KNOW MORE THAN YOUUUUUUU!!!! HOW DARE YOU QUESTION MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!"" she points to me. ""MONSTERRRR!!!! HOW DARE YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!"" she kicks the table, which topples over her coffee cup. [Reminded me of Cartman that one time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbebjUYItKw).

We were done at that point. We cleaned up after ourselves only, not minding her tantrum, and legged it to my part of the house. We're still giggling over it, reminding ourselves the times she claimed erosion, time zones, and gravity were only theories yet to be proven.

Next time on Tsarina believes Ancient Aliens: Earth is flat.

Not really. I don't *believe* she's one of those yet, but she does question the moon landing, calling the Mythbusters episode that debunked the moon landing hoax theory a hoax in on itself."

BB can catch you up, but quick background: my JNMom and JNStepdad, for ridiculous reasons, have never liked my SO. We recently got into a massive argument and I made the grave mistake of talking to my family about it, and now EVERYONE who knows about it has decided against him and is actively trying to disclose him from everything. Yay! On the bright side, I have been going to therapy for all the ish my family has put me through in the past and really building up my confidence to call them out when they’re being rude or pushy, which I haven’t had a chance to exercise until now.

Things with JNMom had been going alright briefly before this, and I thought we were on a good path. JNMom had greeted SO and been friendly and smiley the last time we saw her in person, and when I mentioned SO had been sick once on the phone JNMom made a point to say “I’m glad he’s feeling better.” Even better than that, which I can get into in another post, JNMom added a photo of SO and me to the family Christmas card (!!). Silly me, thinking these were signs of change.

My oldest brother (younger than me) is graduating HS this year, and I guess they got the official date announcement because JNMom texted me to give me the date and time. She could have left it at that, but OH NO. She just HAD to make sure she reminded me that SO was only begrudgingly welcome (see photos below for the exchange).

UGH. I’m proud of myself for exercising my new spine, even if I may have been too nice about it. But, of course, she never texted me back. 🙄 I’m taking it as proof she knows I’m right. Sigh. Back to the information diet we go. When will I learn?"
45,"Small Update 2/Advice request: After 10 years, I've been tagged in.",0xnard_Montalvo,0,38,90,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536150503.0,9d61i2,"Previous Threads [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/9az718/after_10_years_ive_been_tagged_in/) and [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/9b9g5m/update_after_10_years_ive_been_tagged_in/) 

So this is an update looking for advice. Those who want some added drama to the story, there isn’t much. The communication has died down significantly but I did receive one last text from MIL last Wednesday evening at 9:30 that evening:

>**MIL:** Don’t you ever ever talk to me again [FIL] is my proxy. 


So I guess because my wife gets a proxy, she does too. Whatever. It took every ounce of restraint within my body not to shoot back a kissy face + thumbs up emoji combo back at her, but I took the advice of the people and became a black hole. 

Since that evening though, there has been no contact and all has been quiet. The in-laws did not show up this past weekend, and my wife even reconciled with her sister as well. Wife did say that when she told her sister that MIL had been cut off, SIL acted a bit weird, almost like MIL had already reached out to try and manipulate sister, but we aren’t surprised by that at all. I’m glad they are on better terms now but we are keeping them at arm’s length at the moment. 

The real advice/guidance we are seeking involves how to handle dealing/talking with friends and family who are not necessarily supportive of the move to cut off contact with the in laws. These people are not flying monkeys, but friends/family of ours who are privy to some of the history that lead up to this finally coming to a head. These people aren’t sympathetic to the idea that my wife would completely remove her mother from her life until her behavior improves. You guys have been super supportive, and that’s great, but you aren’t the people we interact with on a daily basis. 

We are receiving a lot of “Really? I would never do that to my parents” and “I would be destroyed if my child did that to me.” We get it, you have a healthy relationship with your loved ones but my wife was not privileged enough to have that relationship. It’s hard to articulate succinctly why we have made this decision without airing nearly 30 years of physical/mental abuse/dirty laundry, and I can tell that the responses my wife is receiving are getting to her and adding some doubt to her decision. Nothing extreme like she’s willing to forgive her mother or apologize, but she is somewhat sad that she isn’t receiving as much support as you strangers on the internet have provided.  

The worst one came from her one Aunt (Aunt D) who used to work with MIL and got into her own spats with her over the years. Aunt D is honestly one of the sweetest women on this earth. She constantly finds the good in every and all situations and is what one could call a woman of faith. My wife reached out to her last night to try and gain some support and perspective from her on my wife and MIL’s relationship and the response wasn’t what she wanted to hear. 

Being a person of faith, there was much mentioning of putting things in god’s hands and how it is best to forgive people for their transgressions against you, how it is wrong to hold grudges and that how no one is perfect. She even brought up how MIL’s own twin sister isn’t talking to MIL so wife should show some understanding/compassion for where MIL is coming from. Honestly, it felt a bit preachy, but when you take a step back, it is understandable that this woman would have that kind of response because MIL has done some pretty gnarly stuff to Aunt D in her lifetime, but Aunt D has still come back smiling and attempted to kill her with kindness no matter what. 

Now, ultimately, Aunt D is coming from a place of love and wants the best for my wife. But my wife has confided in Aunt D before. Aunt D is well aware of some of the manipulative stunts that MIL has pulled over the years, which is why my wife was a bit taken aback/disappointed by her lack of full on “support” for my wife’s decision. I just don’t think she completely understands the gravity of the situation from my wife’s perspective. I’m not sure many people do. Is there a way to talk to these people, who we truly love, without being a dick, and without looking like the bad guys who cut off a family member? Is it futile with some people? I just want people to know that we aren’t throwing a temper tantrum and that this is for the betterment of our family. How can we convey that MIL is so toxic to us that we are better off without her in our lives without looking like an A-hole? We don’t necessarily want their sympathy, we just want them to understand our perspective, and honestly, a little bit of support would go a long way.  

Thanks again guys, you’ve been a great help so far.

46,nMom: I just needed the attention,dohako,0,11,18,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536065189.0,9cv9rv,"My nMom has been suffering from dementia for a few years. After visiting her for a week to relieve eDad of some of the overwhelming duties he's happy to take on. I can see it: Her narc attitudes are still playing out well: 

* nMom regularly pees on the bed, and eDad refuses to give her diapers as they are not comfortable. So if she says she needs to go to the toilet, we jump. Twice in the last week she asked me to the toilet within minutes of going the last time. Then nothing happens. She keeps trying for 30 minutes, I ask every 5 if she is done. As we walk back she says: ""I did not need the toilet, but I like that you kept giving me attention. 
* nMom - unable to walk by herself is in constant pain. She permanently sings in a whimpering voice. I ask if she wants pain killers. ""No"". I ask her if she notices that she makes those sounds. ""No pain killers"". I ask her if she can try not to make the noise ""You don't give me any attention if I'm quiet. 
* nMom - is hungry and wants to eat. She is struggling with a spoon but insists my dad gives her all the fruit she has for breakfast cut into tiny pieces. I decide to cut it into larger pieces she can eat by herself and won't need a spoon for. She complains. When I ask why it's not easier like this her reply is: ""I want you to help me with the spoon, I don't want to eat by myself"". We still set there, next to her but we can feed ourselves. 

I'm honestly thinking the next time I help her to relief my dad I'll check her into short term nursing care. "
47,I had to move into my Ndads house again,ditchwater_Sal,0,3,5,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536100787.0,9d0hew,"2 weeks ago the shitty apartment building my family lived in caught fire. The building is closed down until October. We needed emergency accommodations so we ended up at my NDads house. 

I didnt think it would be that bad. As far as Narcs go, hes pretty low on the scale. Plus, he has a second residence that he stays at most of the time. 

But. It's that bad. 

His dad is dying in a hospital around the world and there are some issues getting my ndad a passport. When things get stressful he gets abusive. Laying in bed listening to him yell at his wife and on the phone and to literally everything that passes into his vision is just like high school. Top toeing around and side stepping loaded questions, being around all that explosive energy is bringing me back to all of those feelings of helplessness. 

The only silver lining is that my husband is with me so I'm not alone. I'm glad he gets to see this side of my father. He had no idea. It's also really nice to have someone there to tell me I'm not crazy and all of ndads reactions are unreasonable. "
48,MIL hyjacks Christmas plans. Why are men so blind to their mommies?,kerryap,0,30,82,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536038593.0,9csq1f,"As I’m posting on JustNoMIL safe guess I’m not a fan of mine and she’s racked up some very bad behavior in the 4 years I’ve been married to my husband. Had she lived in the country while we’d been dating I’m convinced we would never have gotten engaged let alone married. The last four years have been a roller coaster of stress and frustration at both her behavior and my husband’s short memory and increasingly creative ways to dismiss her behavior as less than it is. 

Finally two years ago things escalated and I finally refused to be in the same room with her. She’s insulted me to my face, tried to slam my hand in the dishwasher, meddled in my marriage (including snooping in our bedroom and even IN our BED) and all around made life miserable. 

The no contact was short lived. DH insisted he wanted “family” to be together for Christmas. I relented with the condition that it would be on neutral territory. I was not going to her home (seat of power) nor letting her in my home. The idea of trying to prevent her from snooping again or worse getting her out of my house when I’d reached my max was a firm No Go. Christmas 2017 was spent at Whistler. The location had something for everyone adult or toddler. Everyone stayed several days, Christmas was bearable. 

I did not however like planning last minute, nor paying last minute prices and insisted we book with more notice for 2018. Upon departing I suggested to all parties Hawaii, any thoughts. To my face MIL was agreeable. My husband has observed me plan, list build, research and all but book this even for 9 months. Now I’m insisting we book. Upon sharing the plan with MIL husband comes back with following text “Mom would rather spend her birthday (Jan 25th) in Hawaii. How about we go to Boston instead.” 

We have a 3year old and my last recollection of Boston was a very adult town. But the suggested alternative location is beside the point. DH was shocked when I didn’t really think this was a swell idea. **Why are men so stupid about their mommies**. If this had come from anyone else he would have caught it a mile off. “I have decided on Hawaii for my birthday so you can’t go for Christmas.” Come on dude this is rude!!!! "
49,Irked at the overly positive “advice” I’ve been given by Nmom,BlueGreenandPink,0,3,1,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536094668.0,9cznhg,"So, the day after Nmom told me I should just give up on school because it’s “taking too long”. The next day, I distanced myself (as much as possible considering I live with her) and tried grey rocking as much as possible. 

Today she sends me texts/screenshots from an Eckhart Tolle book (The Power of Now) about gratitude and being grateful and “not to focus too much on the future” because it’s “all about living in the present moment”.  Ummm... where was this gratitude two days ago when you were telling me to drop out of school, give up on my dream & “figure it out” ?

I rolled my eyes when I saw these texts: 1) because I used to be an extreme “always be positive” person (and have since realized I was using that as a way to not deal with my own issues... so I’ve toned that down a lot) and would try to tell her to do the same because she was (is) always so negative and 2) because I feel she should take her own advice before she tries to pawn shit off on me. She refuses to speak to her own MIL who lives down the street because of some stupid “he said she said” drama but *I* need to be grateful and “have faith”? 

Does anyone else get angrily irritated by Nparent attempts to be “positive” when they JUST told you something extremely contradicting (like to give up on your dream because it’s taking too long)?? 

Do I even respond to the texts? (I haven’t yet... wasn’t planning on it) 

This is SO irritating. "

51,guilt about going NC with my Ndad,handling-crazy,0,4,6,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536070517.0,9cvzt0,"This is my first post, so my apologies on the length and if it doesn’t make complete sense.

it’s been almost 2 months since I got the courage to go completely NC. obviously there’s a bunch of backstory with my tipping point happening in February. i shortly went NC for about a month in march because we got in a fight about him ignoring my calls and texts to see him. he claims they don’t happen or that he’s just “so so busy that i couldn’t understand.” i’m a 5 minute drive off a highway on his way too and from work. so then he took a week vacation from work to fly across country to see his gf’s son. I was a “bitch” because i’m never happy for him and it’s selfish i’m mad that he was doing something nice for himself. you know, the usual. 

So july rolls around and he’s threatening to take me (21F)  to court for multiple reasons and saying my degree is worthless and i’m just a freeloader ( i’m in nursing school.) He texted me while I was working the night shift at the hospital, so I immediately know it was going to get ugly. I can attach screenshots of the conversation if you guys want, it’s pretty lengthy. but what he said that night will forever be engrained in my memory, almost like the night he pulled a shot gun on me. i told him i was done with him he told me “well goodbye don’t be mad when I die. i’m going to my attorney tomorrow and leaving everything to your brother. your mouth is overriding your ass.”  so I stopped responding because it’s useless. he then texts me like nothing is wrong and acts sad that i’m not in Arizona with him visiting his gf’s son. 

Honestly I could go on and on about the toxic shit he’s put me through. I had to take the ACEs test (for childhood trauma) in a class last week and my score really put it in perspective on how fucked it all really was. I am 100% confident that this is the best thing i’ve ever done for myself but I still have so much guilt. guilt that there’s more I can do or he just needs another chance. 

I am so happy that i’ve found this sub. I finally feel normal and validated, which is a new feeling for me. Cheers to daddy issues! "
52,FMIL Hijacks Wedding Date/Venue for Separate Event,marsbringerofsmores,0,121,785,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536101784.0,9d0lwp,"Hi everyone! Using an alt and have changed some details for better anonymity.

My FMIL and I always had a good relationship and she seemed really happy that her son and I were planning to get engaged. ""Weddings make people crazy,"" my sister warned me, but I didn't listen. So I was totally off guard when FH and I got engaged for real, and FMIL suddenly started being a drama queen.

We went to dinner at FH's parents house soon after the engagement. FMIL didn't say congratulations at any point in the evening, and socially awkward FDIL had to remind her that we were celebrating. She asked to see my ring, but then just said, ""It's pretty,"" and that was the end of that.

We discussed our wedding plans and dates with them. FMIL is a big deal in the ornamental arborist (read: fancy trees) community and we were planning on having our ceremony in the public ornamental garden that FMIL has overseen for years. We thought it would be a nice gesture to incorporate her life's work in our wedding, and she seemed so excited about it. She immediately suggested a date late next year when the trees would look their best, and since she's the expert, we settled on that date.

That was all the wedding talk that we were able to get in - it was literally about 10 minutes - before FMIL changed the subject to herself. She started complaining about her job, and how everyone was against her, and how no one appreciated what she did for the company. She spent the next TWO HOURS throwing herself a pity party and even mentioned that if she was too upset, she might not be able to make our wedding. 

At that point, I just made an excuse and we left. Her behavior was so out of left field that I didn't know what to make of it. I talked to FH about it and we agreed that she must be stressed because she recently found out that her brother has a life-threatening illness and is taking it hard.

Fast forward to a couple of weeks later, and I have been a busy bee getting all of our vendors lined up, making plans and deposits, and feeling really proud of how well it was all coming together. Then FH gets a call from his mom. We were still kind of mad at her for her crappy attitude the last time we saw her, but he figured maybe she had calmed down.

Instead of apologizing for hijacking dinner to whine about her life, FMIL told us that she had put in a permit for her arborist group to hold a demonstration AT THE ORNAMENTAL GARDEN ON THE DAY OF OUR WEDDING. This fucking bitch snuck in and informally reserved the space using internal connections before we got our permit approved. 

I am livid. I spent most of yesterday just laying in bed watching TV because I couldn't figure out why she would do this. She's since sent me a series of texts talking about how she would be so hurt if we put in our permit for the same day since she already invited all of her arborist group and supposedly advertised the event to the public.

I'm so floored, I have no idea what to do. Like I said up top, she and I were really close and cool with each other before. FH is her only son, but she never showed any weird Jocasta tendencies. I thought she genuinely wanted us to be happy together, but this stunt proves otherwise. I feel like if we forge ahead and try to officially book the garden, it will destroy any relationship that might be salvaged. But if we let her do this, she will feel she can push us around. On the upside, FH is 100% on my side and is making no excuses for his mom's behavior. 

I'm so mad and overwhelmed. I feel like I had this well-oiled machine of planning going and then FMIL came in from left field and dumped sand all it its gears. :(

Edit: Thanks so much for the congratulations and support. There's been a lot of good tips here. FH and I went over the comments and laid out a plan: Since we want to get married in the garden for reasons specific to us and not FMIL, we're going to talk to our vendors and push the wedding back a week. In the meantime, FH will talk to FMIL and convey how hurt we are by her behavior. She gets no new info about the wedding until all of our permits/vendors are secure and invitations go out. Our vendors will be warned that she may try to interfere, and we will have passwords set up with everyone. If FMIL at any point tries to guilt us or get more info than we want to give, we leave immediately. Keep your fingers crossed for us! I'm hoping that after the wedding she will go back to the self-centered but otherwise cool person she was before (but I'll always remember how she played this and proceed with caution.)"
53,anyone else’s Nparent like this?,randomoutsider,0,3,6,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536098836.0,9d08au,"My nmom likes to blame things on me a lot and when I tell her she does it she makes up excuses and “doesn’t know what i’m talking about”. So, I have mental health problems and she makes me feel so awful about myself because of these things I can’t fix or I can’t help. She ALWAYS says things along these lines, “i feel like my life is going nowhere all because of you and your problems that i have to focus on” “your brother didn’t have mental health problems, he was a normal kid” “you make me so depressed that I stay home all of the time and that’s why i’m not happy, because of you” and the list goes on and on. Now, let me say that she tends to ignore my mental health problems, pushes them to the side and acts like I’m all fine and dandy. She won’t bring me to a therapist. So I’m thinking in my head “How the fuck are you focusing on my metal health ever? How are you trying to make things better and get me help?” It doesn’t make sense to me, because with all of the problems I have it really doesn’t effect her.  She blames her anxiety and depression onto me, she blames  absolutely everything onto me and makes me feel so shitty about myself, I hate myself for everything I can’t help and that’s not fucking right.

57,MIL and the 'homemade soup',Sheanar,0,19,263,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536048521.0,9ctn2t,"I recently joined this sub, and seriously you folks are the best. I've got a JNMIL (NC for 3yrs), a JNXMIL(LC), and a Nmom(NC 1yr). So really, great. Finally feeling like I'm not alone and in many cases seeing abuse for what it is. I could write so much just on what I've learned, but there is another sub for that.

For my first post I have decided to feed the llamas with a great BEC moment from JNMIL.

Backstory: I've known my BF for about a decade, but we've only been together a few years on account of her meddling. She's been spreading lies about me since she heard of me. Eventually, he grew a spine and we got him and his brother away from her.

Right before I moved in with my BF, YGMIL died of a heart attack, and right after GFIL was diagnosed with cancer. We live literally next door to him, so we took care of most of his day-to-day care (despite JNMIL's sister living next door on the other side - they shared a patio). Every so often JNMIL or JNMIL's sister would bring by leftovers and stay for a little bit, but then he'd call myself or BF (or BF's brother who lives with us) to help him clean up the mess they made. 

One time I was helping him with phone calls to doctors and making him lunch when JNMIL came over. She was oscillating between pretending to be happy I was caring for her dad and CBF. It was so awkward every time I had to deal with her. So on this one occasion she made a big show of this up-cycled yogurt tub full of ""homemade soup I *just* made last night. You can reheat it for him for dinner"". She went on about how good it was but eventually stuffed it in the fridge and left. 

Cancer is ruthless, and GFIL had no teeth in the first place and couldn't use his dentures. The guy was living on soups and mashed foods. If she cared at all she could ask him what he'd like or what he's been eating. But then she wouldn't be a JN, would she? 

The soup she was going on about was just some canned beef chunk soup she had put into a tub and made this huge story to feel good about herself. GFIL took one look and said he wouldn't eat it. When I showed it to BF and BF's bro we all agreed to just push it to the back of the fridge and wait for a good chance to toss it. She's one of those people who just don't care. She brought him soup for herself, not really for him. I knew it, she knew I knew it, but I was just smiling and nodding to make her leave faster.

Not directly related, but sort of. After she saw how much GFIL trusted me with his care she lost her shit (more) and added to the list of lies she was telling her side of the family about me. My ""favourite"" being that I wanted dead YGMIL's jewelry and such. Unfortunately it worked. By the time of GFIL's funeral none of that side of the family will talk to any of us, except for BF's 2 half-sisters (3 different dads between them) and they're on book of faces birthday card level contact.

58,How do I get any respect from Nparents who I am dependant on?,Bex917,0,3,3,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536128320.0,9d3ph6,"I'm 22 and a college student, and even though I'm trying to be more independent, I'm still very much dependant on my parents financially and still live at home.  The problem is that they use my dependence of them as leverage against me and constantly put me down and invalidate me, to the point that I only realized how badly they've been treating me after a couple of therapy sessions with my mother made me see the situation from the outside.

I'm mentally ill and that's made it really difficult for me to make progress in terms of acting more independent, but they keep using that as an excuse to treat me like a child and punishing me for still living at home and taking longer to get through school. I can't disagree or be angry or have a different opinion or defend myself because ""you live under OUR roof you follow OUR rules"" and I'm powerless to do anything. I straight up asked my mother why they won't treat me with respect, and though she wouldn't say it directly, her answer basically implied that because I don't ""contribute"" to the family I still have to answer to them. 

It would be one thing if I had a plan and knew I was going to move out soon, but I'm still at a point where I'm living with them indefinitely, and I don't know how much longer I can take it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated"

60,Do I have a narcissistic mother?,throwaway103rabbits,0,7,3,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536121315.0,9d2zb0,"This is just one story, of many.

&#x200B;

Last month I had a mental breakdown of sorts, culminating when my mother used one of my deepest regrets in an argument with me, and I broke down inside of my room and was basically dead for hours. To make a long story short: I (25/m), started to self harm again because of this. I know, I know, I'm pathetic for still living at home at this age, and I shouldn't complain about the way my parents treat me because of it. 

&#x200B;

Anyhow, I set up an appointment with a therapist about this: both the mental breakdown and the ensuing self-harm, and my mother insisted on coming along. My brother, who was taking me, saw no problem in it. Until I got called into the Therapist's office and she insisted on coming in with me. 

&#x200B;

When the therapist arrives my mother goes on for ten minutes about how horrible her life has been, how hard I've made her life, (I dropped out of college to take care of her after a surgery), and goes on to list all of her traumatic events and starts crying in the office. She sees the same therapist and had an appointment set for the next Monday, mind you. 

&#x200B;

Then she goes on to talk about my anger issues, and brings up that deep regret that she knows I have as some sort of justification to the therapist. How abusive her parents were, and how nobody at home listens to her. I couldn't get a word in edgewise, until, at the end of her tirade about her hard life she said, ""and he just  blew up yesterday and I don't know why,"" through her tears. 

&#x200B;

Ten minutes later and she finally leaves and I'm left to speak with the therapist, who then says I have anger problems and advises me on finding an anger management course. I couldn't tell them that I was suicidal. I tried to explain to them the self harm but they didn't listen. Now I can't go back because the therapist thinks I'm some sort of rage induced monster. 

&#x200B;

This was the event that made me question whether or not my mother may have something wrong with her. Please help me understand. Or is there something genuinely wrong with me for being upset with this? "

I ended up taking a day trip with my older brother today & once I returned back home, all hell broke loose. My nMother went into my room, searched my bed, looked through an ENTIRE STACK of printed documents and decided to read all of them. Not all of them were filled out nor were about therapy but she decided to bring the forms to my dad and blame him for basically why I'm so fucked up as an adult now. She bombarded me as soon as I came home with waterworks about how this isn't how she envisioned my life & she did everything she could to make sure I was raised correctly. She went on and on about how she didn't mean to read ""the papers"" and since I just got home, I wasn't even sure what papers she was even talking about so I brushed it off. It wasn't until I talked to my dad and he told me that I need to make sure to ""keep my private documents out of sight"" because she'll go through them. I just don't understand why it's okay to have my privacy violated like this?  

&#x200B;

My dad is upset because I dared to write that my parents' relationship is dysfunctional & abusive on both sides (Apparently calling it domestic violence means that it's only physical and is only his fault???) & he's upset that I didn't talk to him about this first before ""writing it down & speaking to a stranger."" I'm just so drained and irritated by the whole entire thing. I'm currently taking a leave of absence from college due to my declining mental health & I realized some of my key personality traits are caused by my dysfunctional childhood -- thus why I mentioned the domestic violence & dysfunctional parental relationship. I finally convinced myself to go to therapy & I have been so anxious about this appointment so this is just the icing on the cake. I feel like I started a rift between me & my dad (bc ""I"" caused an argument b/w him & nMother) and somehow like I should be more mindful of others' feelings when all I wrote was my truth. I'm tired of having my boundaries violated and being disrespected but I don't know how to set boundaries bc I've never experienced what healthy boundaries look like.

62,"FoxInLaw's Origin Story, or how I am hiding from Mocha Mix without hiding",FoxInLaw,0,8,89,False,JUSTNOMIL,Munchausen's By Foxy,1536101378.0,9d0k32,"Howdy! My name is FoxInLaw, and I am a survivor of Munchausen's By Proxy. I have long since come to terms with the abuse I suffered under my mother, who I call Mocha Mix because that was her crap of choice to drown her coffee in, she refused to drink coffee without it nor would she use anything else.

So first up, to those who were following my Vacation Log, I am safe and sound and home with JYM again. Mr. Foxy and I got so caught up in each other during the trip I didn't have time to update the log. I'll post how the rest of the visit went later, I promise ♡

Now, looking at a few of the posts today, I decided to tell you guys why I called myself FoxInLaw here.

So, believe it or not, Foxy here isn't all that clever. I use literally two screen names wherever I go on  the Web to make it easier to find me. ~~I also wanna kinda be Internet famous but that's neither here nor there~~

Well, Mocha Mix knows one of these names. And when Foxy was younger, Mocha Mix made me an email account. A yahoo account which had a butchered spelling of the name. I hated this email and was glad to go to Gmail instead because looking at her mangled attempt at spelling it hurt.

The main reason? It wasn't actually my email.

Mocha Mix only made it to keep in contact with me, but she had some stipulations for using it:

* I was not allowed to change the password on it
* Dad was not allowed to have access to it in any way
* I could not give it to ANYONE
* I had to ask her permission to use it on ANY site
* I was not allowed to send messages to anyone except her
* Nor could I delete anything until she read it first
* Any site I signed up on with this, I had to give her access to as well, with the same rules above

As you can see, she is no different from many JustNo's who crave control. I was always scared of trying to do anything with it because she was super strict on how I browsed the web. I was living with Dad at this point (because why else would your Proxy need to be able to communicate online?) but I never thought of the logic involved. I was always afraid of making Mocha Mix mad so I never went beyond Neopets until Dad convinced me sometime later to make a gmail. To this day, I am fairly certain she doesn't know this email, mainly because it spells my name correctly since I made it myself. I had never felt so empowered as I did the day I made my gmail.

Which brings us to FoxInLaw.This subreddit is the only site I use this name, because most things searchable by my normal name are now inactive. 

I'm hiding to an extent, but I'm not living in fear that Mocha Mix will return and try to reign me back in. I'm not gonna let her ruin the one place where I can freely discuss the shit she did to me. I enjoy telling these stories in real life, but I want to be able to talk about it here where I can focus and concentrate on as many details as possible so that I can always remember, and hopefully inspire others on this sub to escape their abusers.

That said, if anyone wants, or even knows my name, I certainly don't mind. 

Vacation Tax!

[This is Figaro](https://imgur.com/qABLfJC). One of the places Mr. Foxy took me to was Kentucky Castle, and at the desk area, they had a bunch of toys on a clothing rack, but this little guy was sitting all by himself in the corner while the other toys were grouped together on the other side. BF and I LOVE dragons and he decided to get him for me. I love this thing to bits, and actually let his head stick out of my backpack the entire trip home."

ANYWAY DH works for a large company. Offices in multiple states, etc. We told the new location not to release ANY info about husband. Don't confirm that he works there. Nothing. 

Death Cookies called the old location and played the 'forgetful old lady' and managed to get the number of the new location DH transferred to. She then proceeded to call the new location. The receptionist didn't get the memo, apparently, and gave her DH's extention. As soon as he picked up he was treated to ear piercing wailing. Not talking or crying. Just full on banchee wails. He hung up, she called again. And again. She left 12 full voicemails of this before his mailbox was full. Then she switched back to calling the receptionist and wailing at her. 

DH was called in to a meeting with HR and had to provide copies of the RO. Legal is sending her a letter. The police in old town have been notified. IT had to set up a whole new extention for DH. I believe they've blocked her number as well but it won't stop her. 

But now Death Cookies knows where we moved. At least we already have security cameras, I guess. 

Fantastic. I feel like she's already ruined the new town."
64,Drizella got a dress,redlaffite,0,38,151,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536119959.0,9d2u1k,"After my post I realized I should probably more charitable to Drizella 

As annoying as her constantly contacting me (not fiancé ) about her dress I don’t care about at least she wanted to make us happy . I thought I was being to harsh as she might honestly just be confused about the formality level.  Lots of places mean different things by formal semi formal etc .  For us Basically the idea is formal but appropriate for a morning wedding. Maybe my numerous examples (and fiancé straight up just telling men what to wear : slacks / dress shirt / tie if they don’t want to wear the jacket because of the heat) wasn’t enough and she is just a little insecure .  

She had sent a message to fiancé and I in a group chat saying how she is asking because she wants to make sure she wears something that works and doesn’t make her look over or under dressed . 

I figured parents will be dressed closer to formal than not so i guess maybe my examples just weren’t clear 

So I reached out . Called her and described dresses similar to the women in my family are wearing (all full length dresses but no rhinestones or poofy or really formal details. Most are in more breathable materials with thin straps etc because it’s in a tropical destination ) It’s a little hard to describe but it was essentially a sea of full length formal to (rather dressy) semi formal dresses . Sent her a Pinterest link 

I tried to be as nice as possible and even sent her some examples of the sort of dark green I meant .  

Drizella was really nice on the phone and told  me she was super appreciative and thanked me, assured me when she found something she would send me a picture before buying it to make sure it worked and how excited she was because she had a few beautiful green dresses in mind 

I thought “wow I’m such a jerk for being so annoyed with this “

....... 

She came back with: 

One short burgundy dress with a super bold bohemian type pattern

A paisley pattern muumuu that was all black and looked almost like a beach cover up

Notice literally none are any type of green. And none are even sort of formal . 

And of course despite literally sending every and all questions to me she didn’t send those options to me. Nope. She sent them to fiancé after buying them saying how she was so thankful how helpful I was. Even some about how much she loves all of her options and was so glad to have something. 

Then she asked “which of these dresses do you want me in on the wedding day “

First of all weird phrasing .

Second I can’t tell if 

- she is seriously this socially incompetent / color blind (honestly it is a possibility this is what she thinks formal is ?)

- she really like those types of dresses so is ignoring what we said 

- or she is trying to make fiancé think I intentionally misled her on formality level

Luckily there is a 4th dress she ordered offline so cross your fingers ?

Fiancé said “hmm I’ll just wait to see the 4th dress first “

How do you even respond???"
65,Grandmother that wants to be called “Mama”.,throwawayaccount749,0,180,534,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536096062.0,9czuq1,"I just need opinions on this.... I won’t go into details but long story short is that my boyfriends mom wants to be called “mama” by our daughter. 
It’s apparently Filipino culture, and she has 3 other grandchildren that call her that. 

I am not Filipino, I’m Puerto Rican and In Spanish “mama” means mom. and my daughter has already started to call me “Mama”. I never forced it on her, it’s just come naturally for her. 

I don’t want her calling his mom “mama.” I just want her to call her grandma or something else. Anything but “mama”. 

What do you guys think? I’m stressing out over this and my boyfriend doesn’t agree with me. He also wants our daughter to call her mama and I’m 100% against it.

66,I think my own mom will be (is?) a JUSTNOMIL,readyrosie,0,24,101,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536058393.0,9cuj6n,"Let me set the stage: I (24f) have been dating my partner (30m) for over a year. Shortly after our anniversary, we moved in together and it’s been really lovely. I could go into a novel about all the ways we are compatible, but I don’t think that adds to the story, so just believe me - he’s great! Another important tidbit- I was raised Southern Baptist but I accidentally became a feminist instead. 

So here we go:
My SO has always followed my lead with my family because we are a weird bunch. When we decided to move in together, I decided that we would wait until about a month before our move-in date, take my parents out to a nice dinner, and break the news. Unexpectedly, my mom went out of town so we were only able to tell my dad. He was great, congratulated us, and wished us well. Since I wanted my mom to hear it from me first, I had to settle for a phone call to her.  Here’s the gist of that phone call:
“If he loved you, he wouldn’t live with you before marriage” (Mom, I love and respect you, but this is my choice.) “I raised you better than this!” (Mom, you raised me to be an independent and free-thinking woman, which I am so thankful for!) “You are DENYING ME the chance to pay for your wedding one day” (Well Mom, one day we are going to have a wonderful wedding and I want you to be involved, but that will have to be your choice.) “GOD WON’T LET THIS HAPPEN! I’m going to pray for you and WATCH, it won’t happen!” (At this point, I reiterated that I loved her, but I also wasn’t going to argue with her. I told her that if she wanted to have a conversation about our reasons for moving in together, that’s fine... but I wasn’t going to get in a religious debate.) 

End phone call. 
Cue the prayer chain. 

Over the next few days, I received calls, texts and emails from family and church members letting me know that my mom had contacted them, and that they would be praying for me. I also received many weepy texts from my mom telling me that I’ve broken her heart, worried about my safety(?) and lots of other emotional dialogues. One time I called home, and she hung up on me saying that she couldn’t hear my voice without crying. 

So move-in day comes and goes without a hitch. Thankfully for us, we did not get struck down or break up from my mom’s prayers. Woohoo! 

More recently, my mom has uninvited us from one family event and refused to speak to us at another. When we were uninvited, I let it roll off my back because I hadn’t wanted to go anyways. However, the refusing to speak got undeeer my skin. We went over to their home for a family lunch, and she said 2 words (hi, bye) to me and 0 words to my SO. We left as soon as lunch was over because I was so embarrassed about that way my SO had been treated. In the car on the way home, we reflected on the day, on our feelings, and made a game plan for future encounters. (yes, he’s willing to try again!!!? He’s been so forgiving and understanding through this whole thing!)

This morning I woke up to another text from my mom saying that she was so concerned about me and I should MOVE HOME. This was the last straw and I sent her a very firm response telling her she needs to stop, calling out her behavior, and telling her that nothing she does will change my mind. No response yet, will update if it’s anything worthy of an update. 

Also, if you’ve made it this far, my SO is planning on proposing sometime later this year, we want to elope to Mexico next summer, and his family is wonderful! 

Phew. That was therapeutic to type it all out. "

Anyway, if the title didn't clue you in, my JNmom and I don't have the best relationship. Actually, we haven't talked in almost half a year.  I might post the story later, but basically she took me to people I love and screamed at me in front of them saying I was infested with evil spirits...and that that's why I have health issues. I should also add that I was extremely sheltered growing up (username should check out) and this plays a huge part in my life even now.

Now I really love my D(earest in the world)F and his family is great. I've never had any problems with them. But I'm having an extremely hard time opening up to them after ""the attack"" from my JNmom. 

For example, last weekend DF gets a call from FMIL saying she wants to talk. DF thought she sounded a bit serious on the phone and that something had happened. (As in they needed a serious talk). Y'all, I went into a freaking anxiety attack for him! My heart was pounding, I felt like I was gonna puke and cry.
When he called her back to talk, she literally just wanted to chat. Poor FMIL is sick and sounds a little weird on the phone. But that little incident was enough to physically affect me. She did nothing wrong at all, but my brain jumped to thinking DF was gonna have a fallout like I did with JNmom.

I don't really know what I should be asking for, maybe some kind of advice to keep my feelings for my JNmom separate from my FMIL? I can't go to therapy right now (and I'm afraid to) but I don't know what else to do. I'm even afraid JNmom will somehow find out about this post.

This got long. Let me finish by saying ever since the incident with JNmom, I have been reading nearly every post on here. Y'all will never know how much you've helped me. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart.

TL;DR Terrible relationship with JNmom is affecting my relationship with FMIL when it shouldn't. Please help.

68,PlantageNOT: the BEC files,NotFuckingWarren,0,25,159,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536035221.0,9csdw1,"Hey Llamas!  This is mainly some weird & BEC stuff, all leading up to the big blowout.  Standard disclaimers apply.  We are super NC.  See BB for previous crazy.

So when we last left off, PlantageNOT tried to be all Gollum about FIL's dress clothes and acted like the nasty, spiteful person she is and we had a baby shower in the midst of a family tragedy.  These moments take place in the month that followed: 

-The dueling phone calls continued, with a twist:  now PlantageNOT wanted to make DH the beneficiary of her life insurance policy.  All she needed was his SSN.  

Um, NOOOO.

-FIL gets wind of this (don't know how) and ups the ante: he wants to make the baby his beneficiary.  That is still inside me.  Then he couldn't understand why this wasn't possible. (Not that we would have gone for it anyway).

-Conversations start about holidays.  We tell both that we will split them.  FIL gets Thanksgiving,  PlantageNOT can come on Christmas Day afternoon  (cause you aren't fucking up my Doctor Who Christmas episode, I don't care who you are).   Both were pissy because we should leave the other out and give them allll the holidays because the other sucks.  

Seriously?  How about you both suck and we just dip the fuck out?  Yeah, thought so.

- Then we get to the main event:  who gets to come to the hospital after DD is born (at what time).  Now again, I will give PlantageNOT this.  She never tried to be there while I was in labor in any capacity.  (Small favors to your deity of choice, right?)  But we did have their RO to consider when it came to visiting, and she was insistent that she be there before FIL.  

Luckily, FIL was respectful of us from jump and had suggested he come the day after.  He did act like an ass that day...but that's a mention for the comments should anyone care to hear.

Summer turned into fall and the big day arrived.  After a fashion, DD made her appearance.  Now, I had made a special card for DH to keep in his wallet for the big day.  It was a list of which friends to call, which friends to text, and when for when we went to the hospital (we have a good sized circle of friends that have become our family, both in and out of state).  At the bottom of this card, it said: 

""Call your family at your discretion.""

Note:  Just so everyone understands, (and because it is about to come into play) my choice of wording is simply how I speak, and it was a wallet sized card.  So I kept it simple. DH and I had previously discussed what I wanted and he was in total agreement.  The card was a reminder because 1st baby and shit gets hectic.

No big deal, right?  Ha!  Sure, keep dreaming.  

I do my thing, DH does his thing (and is fucking amazing), the doc does his thing.  DD checks out and we are having cuddle time while I finish my bag of pitocin and get some feeling back in my legs (thank Glob for epidurals, ya'll, 46 hours from start to finish is a BITCH).  My best friend is there, and DH asks if PlantageNOT,  Sibling and Sibling's SO can come in.  I say sure, everyone is cool and DD is passed around (with my consent).  It really was ok!  Then, DH gets the card out to make the last round of calls/texts and Sibling and SSO offer to help.  DH hands over the card, it gets done.  Again, everything seems fine. 

Fast forward to a few days later.  PlantageNOT comes to visit us at the house.  And that's when the other shoe drops.  Turns out they were hurt by me writing 'at your discretion' on the fucking card.  Why?  No idea to this day.  Just didn't like the word choice. 

Now, I couldn't believe that Sibling and SSO would give a flying fuck about something so trivial, nor would they take issue with the notion that it was DH's prerogative when he called his family. 

 Time would tell on that issue."
69,"Guys, Malbots is coming to visit (and more BEC!)",Carbonatite,0,46,103,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536082486.0,9cxvao,"Malbots is coming to visit.  I say this because I need advice,  and also to warn everyone in the Western United States, because while tornado season may be waning, we are about to get an EF5 level twister of sensible $200 loafers and Coach handbags up in here.  DH may need advice too, in case she can't come over the weekend he goes hunting.  He's pretty good at not getting upset by her antics because he finds it difficult to take Malbots seriously, but that doesn't mean he wants to shop for artisanal jewelry with her.

Speaking of advice, thank you all for your suggestions from the last post on addressing ingrained Malbots-induced behaviors like apologizing too much.  There was a ton of awesome advice for both DH and I and it is very, very appreciated.  As was the photoshopped image with stripes added to Malbots's MotB dress.

Things bode pretty well for the most part, Malbots would never stay with us when there are plenty of perfectly good ""economy"" hotels for her like the Hilton.  DH may be able to avoid her entirely if he goes hunting. I love that he would rather be cutting entrails from a dead elk than be around Malbots.  I am currently coming up with neutral things to do, since I doubt she will want to spend much time in our house with [these two derps](http://imgur.com/DqpNE2f).  Malbots thinks all adopted shelter dogs have behavioral problems.  To be fair, the dachshund did poop in my shoes for a few months after I got him, and both dogs have made valiant attempts at killing [this fluffer](http://imgur.com/ddsQpc8) and her ANGERY sister.  But considering Malbots's first dachshund literally sent people to the hospital with his bites, they're pretty good doggos.  As a former shelter worker, I also want to deservedly out her as a horrible human being: She repeatedly tried to make me give our other dog back to the shelter because Malbots thought she would overwhelm the weiner.  We got our dog from a rescue that adopts out dogs at risk for euthanasia.

I imagine Malbots will continue to try to convince me DH is a low class gold digger who thinks ""our family is a cash cow.""  How do I tell her that shit ain't cool without causing a fight? I am ashamed to admit I don't do much to defend my husband from her behind-the-back words.  I know DH gives less than zero fucks about what she says, but I also want to try and curb her constant shit talking.  

I guess my request for advice boils down to three things:

* How to manage her comments and behavior regarding me and DH, and actually stand up for DH for once.

* How to prepare myself for the inevitable anxiety before and during the visit.

* How to look her in the face after excoriating her on the internets and remembering things I'd repressed for years.  Basically, how do I deal with the guilt (not rational, I know) from telling people terrible stories about her on reddit?

Any advice is welcome, since your collective knowledge is gargantuan.  And now, more BEC moments, because I want to focus on ridiculous Malbots behaviors and ideas to make it all less terrifying. 

MALBOTS AND MY HEALTH

My body temperature is low.  It was 96.8 F for years as a kid and now ranges in the low 97s.  So 98.6 is a fever for me, and an actual low fever for most people is not that low for me.

Despite hearing this same thing at my pediatrician appointments for years, she insisted that I was exaggerating and trying to avoid school when the thermometer measured ostensibly-normal-but-actually-sick temperatures.  Bitch, school was an 8 hour break from you.  Anyway, I got sent to school with fevers for years.  

Overshare ahoy!!  Like seriously, I am going to talk about the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome in detail (and how Malbots ignored this until I was in grad school). Skip if you're not into descriptions of gastrointestinal distress.

So yeah, I have IBS and have had symptoms since age 14.  It started in my teens as excruciating pain after eating, generally lasting 3-4 days of hunched over misery as the pain was so bad I had trouble standing up straight.  Malbots said I was being dramatic.  Eventually the psychiatrist she hired as my ""doctor"" (because he straddled the line of HIPPA like a drunk 19 year old on a mechanical bull) was like ""dude, even I believe her, get her worked up for an ulcer.""  It was not an ulcer, ergo, Malbots was right and I was a painfully bloated fakey faker.

This was the way of things for years.  Eventually things got worse. The college health center evaluated me for an ulcer again.

Eventually I said fuck Malbots and her obsession with my malingering.  I was sick and needed a gastroenterologist.  After several cameras in several orifices, the doctor said ""Eh, probably IBS"" and I knew where to go from there.  He emphasized the need for stress control. 

Ironically, Malbots has an autoimmune condition which can cause similar symptoms.  She used to tell me I made it worse when I stressed her out.  It also causes a higher risk of certain cancers.  Let's all take a moment to savor this delectable irony. 

MALBOTS AND TIDY DOORWAYS 

Malbots made everyone remove their shoes at the door and leave them carefully aligned at the edge of the rug by the door.  I don't think this is terrible, taking shoes off at the door=less frequent cleaning.  But Malbots took it to the next level.  

Malbots also had a retainer at the time after having adult braces.  When she talked, she sounded exactly like ~~the nerdy kid who hits on Meg~~ Neil in Family Guy.  It was actually delightful, because it's hard to take verbal abuse seriously when the abuser sounds like an angry 6th grade D&D player.

Anyhoodle, one day my platform flip flops (early 2000s, obvs) had been haphazardly and sinfully left by the door.  Malbots yelled ""Carbonatite, pick up your **schews**!!""  I think there may even have been some angry spittle flying out.  I burst out laughing.  She threw the platform flip flop at my head.

MALBOTS AND *THE HELP*

Malbots ranges from tolerable to traumatizingly embarrassing in her interactions with service workers.  She does this weird wiggly finger wave thing to get servers' attention.  She sends back her wine and medium-well filet mignon about 25% of the time.  She never asks for stuff to be comped.  She doesn't care about money, she's just a dick to people.

On my 23rd birthday, my parents took me to a fancy Indian restaurant.  Malbots ordered something.  The waiter brought the something she ordered.  She claimed she ordered something else, the waiter politely showed her a menu and what she had ordered.  She claimed she ordered something else.  The confused waiter left after a gaslighting/beratement session to make the meal Malbots actually wanted.  She commented on how ""none of these people speak English well"" as he left, while still in earshot.  She made such an ass of herself that my dad added a $200 tip to a $120 bill out of pure humiliation and apology once she sauntered away from the table to the lobby.

MALBOTS AND OUTDOORSINESS

My family's attitude towards outdoor activity ranges from ""I ski occasionally in designer 1990s jackets"" to ""I literally climbed Mount Everest"".  DH and I lean towards the latter, though my current mountaineering status is ""I only lost a chunk of skin from my nose once while ice climbing"".  Malbots has no idea why we do such hazardous things as rock climbing and walking our dogs in dusty dog parks.  I still don't think she believes that my field gear for work includes hard hats, safety vests, steel toed boots, and jeans that only cost $30 covered with nitric acid stains.

Malbots's attitude towards this?  ""My idea of camping is a 3 star hotel with no hair dryer.""  Direct.  Quote.

Edited to add: DH is diligently reading your comments and is leaving his own here and there.  He actually reminded me of some wedding shenanigans I had forgotten in his last comment (previous post, see BitchBot for details). He is a cool dude.

71,JNMom or was I in the wrong?,ColdburnEntity,0,8,12,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536058001.0,9cuhvp,"Hello everyone. I'll fully admit that I'm very much a lurker, but I adore this sub and its community. I found it about a month ago and been binging between classes and occasional slow moments ever since. I will warn that I tend to have a sailor's vocabulary, but it shouldn't be too bad. This will also be a bit long.

I may have a JNMom on my hands, but I'm not sure. It's hard to figure out if the awfulness is because of you or because you can't recognize you're in the FOG. I've watched you guys talk down people who were making mountains out of anthills and convince people on the fence about their MIL/Mom that things are, indeed, fucked up. I won't lie, I'm nervous as shit about this, because only my closest friends and immediate family plus an aunt know it, but I think I need some unbiased perspectives to get some closure. So, today, I'm going to talk about the most fucked up thing my mother has done to me: kicking me out during Easter weekend. 

For context, I'm in my early 20's and going through college while living at home. Dad's not in the picture and I live with (jn?)Mom, OB1, and OB2. JNMom is the breadwinner of the household. OB1 was also working, but at a shitty factory job and OB2 was also going through the academic wringer with me. JNMom works for most of the day at a city that's 1-2 hrs drive away from home. 

This was happened last year, and we were in a really bad spot. Bills weren't being paid, we were occasionally going hungry, and shit was just really bad. It got to the point where my JYBF sent me money so I could buy myself food at a local fast food joint and a bit extra for some basic groceries. 

Roughly a week before Easter, the power went out. My brothers and I initially thought it was only going to be for a few days, so we resolved to suck it up and deal with it. This went on for a few days, but after a while, JNMom clued us in: no, it wasn't going to be a few days. It was going to be out for two weeks - until my mother could be paid. 

I won't lie, I didn't handle that very well. There's a myriad of reasons I hide behind when justifying what happened, but really, it boils down to two points: me and my cat. We don't live in a particularly cold state, but I straight up just don't handle the cold well. Even in the middle of summer, I'm usually still wearing jeans and a hoodie (or at least carrying it around), even when it's 80-90F. There was also my coursework, as some of it relied on online or technology-dependent components. But to be honest, I could (and did) go to a Starbucks, buy something cheap off of the menu, and work on it on the laptop. 

Really, if I'm being honest, it was mostly because of my cat. I had adopted her (read: picked up a half-dead cat off the sidewalk and nursed back to health) about a year ago from the time of this, and I loved that little grouchy thing to the bottom of my heart. She was old, fragile, had a myriad of health issues, and was as close to medically retarded as a cat could be, but she was my baby. Seriously, if animals could be on the spectrum, she would have been in the deep end, but that just made her all the more loving and charming to me (and my JYBF for that matter). That said, she dealt with the cold worse than me, which pushed me towards action more than anything else, tbh.

So... I called my (mostly) JY aunt. This was the second time I had called her about help with the power being cut off. The first time was several months prior. Originally, I had called her to ask if she wanted any of our refrigerated/frozen foods, but it devolved into me sobbing my eyes out and asking for help very, very quickly. This is a small thing that I had forgotten up until now, but I was fucking terrified of my mother finding out about me calling her and begged her not to say anything. Not that mattered much, really, it was a no-brainer on who would have the gall of asking JYA for help.

To be completely honest, the next part is something of a blur. I don't remember much about it, but it still hurts like fucking hell. The brothers and I went to Starbucks to work on stuff until it closed. While we were there, the brothers were texted by JNMom and OB1 told me we were going home. Okay, it's a bit early, but fine. I was too anxious to care about the 'why,' or why I hadn't been texted, either. I remember being confused when we got home on why they were giving me weird looks and asking if I needed help. It took about thirty minutes for OB1 to get more than a little agitated and me finally getting enough context clues to realize that she had texted OB1 and OB2, but not *ME*, that me and spectrum kitty were no longer welcome in her home and that I should go over to JYA's. I remember screaming at OB1 to fuck off and that I'd take care of my shit, so he did, indeed, fuck off while I freaked out. 

I called JYA and asked her to come grab me and texted JYBF what happened. For context, JYBF a continent and an ocean away from me, so I couldn't exactly go over to his place. I regret going over to JYA's place now, but honestly? I had nowhere else to go. So I stuffed spectrum kitty into a cat carrier, shoved some clothes and random personal effects into my schoolbag, and left with JYA. Apparently, JNMom had come home while I was packing and left with the brothers, so the house was empty when JYA and I left.

That weekend was... not good. My JYA takes care of my justno grandfather, who was kept in the dark about everything due to my JYA's insistence. He was *not* happy I was there and made it clear he wanted me gone ASAP. Even a year later, I still haven't forgotten it and we have a very superficial relationship. My cat could be let out in my JYA's bedroom during the day, but she had to go back into the cat carrier at night due to the fact that there were cats already living there. 

I legitimately don't know what I would have done without my boyfriend. He was fucking amazing and totally on point while I was falling apart. He researched cheap vehicles that I could live in, grants/scholarships so I could continue schooling, what options I had in welfare, low income options for veterinary care for spectrum kitty, and likely more that I've forgotten. I don't know what I would have done without it, and this is far from the only thing he's done to help me with absolute bullshit. 

I was kicked out on Good Friday, so I ended up spending the entire long weekend there. JYA convinced JNGF to let me stay there for a while, but practically it was only really going to last for a month or two. But I remember dreading that Sunday, because then OB1, OB2, and JNMom would be there for dinner and I couldn't... face them. Face her, really, if I'm being honest. 

Luckily, that ended up being a problem. JNMom texted everyone (I honestly don't remember at that point if that included me, but I don't *think* so) saying she was not attending Sunday dinner to give me some space, but OB1 and OB2 would bring me home with them afterwards. I did end up going back with them, as it was the easiest option for everyone involved (including JYBF, as helping me get into a semi-stable situation was going to not be cheap on him as I had *no* savings). 

She wasn't at the home when I arrived back. Instead, she appeared the next day, and... neither of us have ever spoken or even acknowledged it. I avoided her for roughly a month afterwards, but she acted like everything was fine and ignored it. 

A year later, the same holds true, but I'm not fine. Our financial situation has improved significantly (or she's hiding it better now), but I'm constantly wondering if I'll still have a home this time next week, and it fucks with me a *LOT*. I suspect that my depression is likely caused or heavily influenced by this event, as it's worsened by no small degree in the last year. I've built up a substantial amount of savings since then, but it wouldn't be enough to pay for a motel for more than a month and certainly not enough to purchase even a cheapo car. JYBF also helped me purchase a big ass MOLLE backpack and helped me fill it up to use as a bug-out bag. Sadly, spectrum kitty has passed away since then, but I take solace in the fact that I wouldn't have to worry about taking care of her if/when I become homeless (and it would be homeless - I *refuse* to go back to my JYA, as much as I know she would want to help. I will not be made to feel like utter crap by JNGF and I would still be in JNMom's reach of control. I almost regret letting myself be kept under her control when I went to JYA, but I had spectrum kitty. I didn't have any other option that wouldn't ultimately hurt her more). 

At this point, I'm sorta in limbo. I'm still living with her as I don't have too many options, but I've made some vague plans to make my escape, as it were. But she's also paying for my education and if I fucked off, it would take me years to get to a point where I could reasonably continue it again. Right now, I think it'll be another year or so until I can move into a university dorm. Honestly, I just want to leave. I want to hitchhike a thousand miles away and deal with being homeless and start again, without her or my asshole OB1 or any of the rest. The rest of my family are, for the most part, just yes and have *no* idea about any of this and while I think they would be horrified to learn about last year, I'm also scared of them all turning into FMs so I'd rather disappear and not have to deal with it. 

Thing is, though, that for the most part? I've had a good relationship with my mother. She's supporting me through school and letting me live in her home for free. I don't have a job because I don't think I'd be able to handle both working and going to school full time. She's generally been very supportive and loving, barring some other isolated incidents and utter insanity regarding her pet dog. It makes me wonder if I deserved what happened.

74,Cutting ties with step-grandmother after grandfather’s death,mrsnosythecat,0,14,13,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536118507.0,9d2ohk,"I originally posted this to r/justnofamily and was told I would be able to post this here. 

Background: My SGM is a typical rug sweeping, finger pointing, lying, perpetual victim of a person. She is never wrong, nothing is ever her fault, she cannot apologize to save her life, anything that happens is always someone’s fault (spoiler alert: except her), everyone is out to “get” her, and she thinks she is perfect and innocent in all situations.

I haven’t spoken to my SGM since my paternal grandfather’s death from cancer at the end of July. I was civil at the funeral home but took great care to avoid her. During his final few months, SGM alienated his family and friends, preferring her fellow Pentecostal cult members to visit him instead, literally shutting out family members to herd in giant groups of church people that had never met him before.  

She robbed my mother of her final time with my grandfather by purposely giving him medicine to make him go to sleep when she found out my mother was coming to spend her (final) time with him.

She gossips freely about my husband and I. My husband was raised in the Pentecostal holiness cult she is a part of, and most of his family is of that denomination. She has lectured me about making sure he stays true to that church, lest he be condemned, and scolded me for DH and I not following their church’s “rules”. I’m talking she straight up degraded DH as a Christian and a person. Her religion also serves as a way to further her “I’m sinless and always the victim” mentality. Any time she has been around my husband, she asks him about other holiness people or ministers, and calls him “Brother FirstName”. My husband has since left that denomination. 

On different occasions, she has:
made a racist comment about my husband (called him a “foreigner”; he’s half Mexican, born and raised in the US), made nasty comments about, and in front of, every member of my family, and told my great grandmother (her MIL) that if my grandfather (GGM’s son and SGM’s husband) didn’t start going to church with her, she “wished he would just go ahead and die so she could find someone who would go to church with her” (this was years before my grandfather was actually diagnosed and later passed away from cancer. He was converted to her cult a couple months before his death and only then did she consider him “saved”).

I actually used to be really close to her, and now I can’t see how I ever was. She was actually the grandparent I was closest to. Either she knew I would always get over it all and forgive her or she honestly believes nothing she does is wrong. So this has been a long time coming. Over the course of the past month or so, I have ignored every attempt she has made to get in touch with me. Everything from asking if I wanted a wreath from my grandfather’s funeral, to saying she had an air fryer if I wanted to use it, to sending me one of my own pins from Pinterest with the caption “love it”. She has also left small gifts on my car as an attempt to get me to communicate with her. Unfortunately we live on the same dead end road, as do my parents and an uncle, so as long as she lives there, she will be driving by my house, seeing if I’m home or not, and seeing my husband and I outside. 

She recently told my father, who still has to speak to her because of business they are in as a result of my grandfather passing, that my husband and I have told her we were never stepping foot in her house again. This is a bold faced lie. Neither of us have ever said anything like that to her, though we indeed do not plan to ever be in her house again. Whenever she is caught in a lie like this, she tries to back up and say she “worded it wrong”. 

I could write countless posts on all of the horrible things she has done. This isn’t even a tip of the iceberg, just some of the more notable offenses. As far as cutting contact with her, should I keep ignoring her, or should I formally put stop to her contacting me and confront her (through text) for talking about DH and I to other people? The rest of my family is also cutting ties with her as far as holidays and things go. I have also now blocked her on Pinterest. 

Part of me hates to cut contact because of the relationship we used to have. However, I have to do what is best for me and my family. She has proved, time and time again, that she does not deserve a place in our lives. 

This is long, so thank you for reading. I appreciate any advice you all may have to offer."
75,"Really worried, idk what to do.",struggle2daywinlater,0,8,3,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536086646.0,9cyhtn,"I’ve been NC with my parents for over a year. My mom emailed me to invite me for some religious event and I didn’t respond like always. I always feel bad and guilty for it. 
I happen to click on my dads Instagram and saw pictures of my mom. She’s lost so much damn weight. Idk why I’m posting this here. She was never like fat. But she’s lost so much weight and I’m so worried about her. I love my mom very much. And I feel sad all the damn time because I can’t have an honest adult relationship with her. Since I was emotionally manipulated and hurt by both parents for years. 

But I’m really worried for her health right now. Idk if I can live in a world without my parents and without having reconciled with them. Like I know our time on the planet is limited. I’m 25 and my parents are in early and mid 50s. We live in Canada so good health care and stuff. I don’t even know what I’m writing anymore. It’s all so messed up in my head. I don’t know what to do. 

Currently, everyone in my life tells me not to break NC because they’re worried for my life and I get that. But I’m so worried for my mom and I think that’s justified.

 When my sister and I started school our friends sometimes came over and wanted to play. We needed to ask first and they often said ""we don't have time, room or I'm cleaning. "" but outside was most times ok.

when I had a friend over we played outside with my game boy. Later my grandmother told me to come in because  because it's getting cold. So we booth go to the door and at that moment my grandmother said ""say goodbye to FRIEND"" I thought we would play inside :( later she complained to my mom ""have you seen this? He already wanted to come in!""
 another time when a friend was actually visiting me she said she's hungry and when the food is ready. I didn't know she will stay that long and will eat with us but I asked my mom. She got angry and said it's not ready, here have a orange! Later when she was gone my mother grumbled at me how illmannered ect. My friend is.. 

When classmates showed up spontaneous (my mom wanted to make window pictures with us) she let them also craft. but when they where gone, we realized that a colour was missing... she complained about how she hates it to watch about others people kids.

another time I was invited to a sleepover party. I was not allowed because they ""forgot"" about it and my big sister (we where at 7th grade or so) would be alone at home. I had to call my classmate who made the party at the day the party was that I couldn't come.  1 month later my sister was on a sleepover and *I* was alone at home...well my sister has a lot of friends..
But I wasn't allowed to complain.
The last time I made a attempt of starting a friendship was 2010...they also complained about how stupid my new friend is...

 yeah after a lot of such stories I stopped to make friends. I grow up in the thought it's something bad and I even made excuses when someone invite me. 

But I ""only"" have 2 close friends that I know since 11/12 years and I won't let anyone destroy my friendship with them! My parents complained about them but I don't listen. 

FUN FACT my parents complained why I don't have friends and do stuff...

Now I'm really bad at talking to people. I'm not very interesting since I don't go out (yes I'm 24 and never went clubbing or so, no I don't even want anymore) and have nothing to talk. So when they start asking me things I get stressed and start talking stupid shit.."
79,Finally told a family member about what my mom became and admitted she caused my suicidal thoughts—not being lonely up here,reallypetitebarista,0,7,131,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536039615.0,9csth4,"My Dad has a friend he’s known since high school, who is basically my uncle. His wife acts like my aunt, and his daughter a cousin. I had work all day today, knowing they love me, I asked if they were doing anything for Labor Day that I could invite myself to. They told me to get over there. (I moved 2 hours away from my immediate family, they’re the only “family” I’m close to visit up here)

In the evening I mentioned something my mother did that bothered me, and explained that’s why I was there, I was lonely and needed to see people I loved and trusted. She seemed concerned, and suddenly it all poured out. The jokes about my suicidal period, jokes about taking medication for my mental health, the demands of me in comparison to the GC, the emotional abuse, the physical abuse, how I once went 4 months without speaking to my mother.

And then, my aunt began to cry, and jumped up and hugged me, she said she knew it was bad, but she didn’t know what my mom was doing to me. That she was degrading me. 

And finally coming from a family member who knows my mom, and not a therapist. Who loves my mom, but believed me, IMMEDIATELY, was so relieving. She just held me while I grieved for my loss of supportive mother and parents as I reached my final years of maturity. She told me it wasn’t my fault, I didn’t do anything wrong, and that I didn’t deserve it, and that I didn’t owe it to them to visit them. 

I’m not crazy, and I got a mommy hug and support like I’ve never had in years. Although I’m still scared, I’m so glad I told. "
80,Advice on rude remarks?,OrdinaryMouse2,0,10,12,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536076350.0,9cwvk7,"JNMom constantly talks shit about people behind their backs. It doesn't matter who they are - she does this with literally everyone. It's generally really gross, uncomfortable triangulation. 

(Actual examples: A classmate's mom is on disability because she's so fat and lazy, how gross and lazy! Your cousin's parents think she's smart but she's really, well, *average at best*. I can't believe anyone would give their kid Ritalin, they obviously just want to make medicated zombies. Your father is so irresponsible and leaves me alone all the time, because he visits friends once or twice a week. Your cousins obviously only went to college to get their ""MRS"" degree.)

Obviously, JNMom tries to sabotage all relationships that aren't with her, and she also demonstrates her behavioral expectations for her children by shit-talking anyone who doesn't meet those (ridiculous) standards.

(And yes, she shit-talks me too, both to my face and behind my back. She's fond of """"honest"""" things like telling me I smell bad, that I'm too fat for a swimsuit, that my hair makes me look like a dyke, etc. I'm not sure what she says behind my back, but I'm sure it's not good.)

I generally grey-rock her, along the lines of ""I'm sure they're fine, Mom -\_\_\_-"". She's a narcissist, so trying to convince her of anything is a pointless endeavor, including ""you're being a dick and need to stop."" (Believe me, I've tried.)

We're already LC, going VLC as I move across the country.

This being said... folks, do you have any thoughts on the best line between information and discretion? 

I don't want to hurt people, especially my significant others, by passing on her toxic bullshit. But I also don't want to keep my mother's secrets or be complicit in her gross secret triangulation. My inclination has usually been to tell people what she's saying about them if they have any ongoing relationship with her, because... I guess I'd rather know if it were me. But... I don't know if that's necessarily the best course of action."

When I was a teenager I LOVED the emo/scene look and I wanted to dress that way desperately, (cringe I know) but if I wore anything black, anything at all really, my mother and her sister relentlessly made fun of me. Makeup? Passive aggressive comments about being a slut, no makeup? You look boring, ""normal clothes""? You look like you don't care, anything black? You look ridiculous what's wrong with you? The only time she ever said anything positive about my appearance was when I would wear anything similar to what she wore when she was a teenager. Now, I never got to dress as a cringey little scene kid, I never got to experience being part of a group because I was too afraid of ridicule, and even now as an adult I struggle with how I'm perceived when I dress. Regardless of what I wear I just hear her telling me I look stupid. Nothing looks right on my body because of her and I can't stand it. She tries to tell me about my younger sister dressing ""strangely"" and I tell her to leave her the hell alone so she won't end up like me. She's bothering my sister less than she did me which I'm grateful for."

He only notices when I don’t do something. Then he even takes credit for shit that **I** do.

Whenever he sees me it’s, “Oh, do ____”
Basically whenever I see him it’s him telling me to do something for him when he doesn’t do shit for me. 

Then the other day he told me to do the laundry and he was hovering over me while I was doing it. I was putting a vent thing in and he was telling me, “you’re putting it in the wrong way, if you would do it you’d know”. Turns out I was in fact putting it in the right way. Shows what he knows.

I’m belittled for every little thing and I’m never appreciated, I swear.

Then now we just got home and he’s telling me to give the dog a bath and put all the dishes away. He’s always telling me to do his shit like I’m a slave. I can’t even take a shower or relax or anything because he wants to go be lazy and sit on his ass and eat and sleep. Then he tells me I need to do this stuff to be responsible and I’ll need to do it one day and learn but he does NOTHING for himself! Responsible my ass!

It’s funny because he told me I’m selfish, disrespectful, only care for myself, and have no goals. Sounds like him. Honestly he can go to hell. 

There’s a difference between doing chores and being a maid/servant/slave. No respect! Nothing for me! And if he says anything he tells me he feeds me. But that’s the bare minimum. He never paid for shit other than food. Mom did everything else.

84,MIL picks random ass mother/son dance song,laurennnnrawr,0,11,31,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536097910.0,9d03ud,"DH and I decided to let my dad and his mom pick the father/daughter and mother/son dance songs for our wedding. My JYDad and I came up with some together and ended up with Your Song by Elton John. We both are fans of Elton and both love the song so it was perfect. I kind of figured MIL would do something similar with DH.

Nope. She ended up picking some song she has seen someone else share on Facebook. It was a song DH had never heard in full until the mother/son dance. It had zero meaning to them and didn't create a special moment for DH. I should have figured this would happen since DH is not the GC. Here some the lyrics to the song she picked. They make me vomit.

""The day has come to let you go. Only happiness I will show"" Poor, poor MIL can't show how sad she is that DH married and is happy with me

""Nothing takes away my love and it shows. Yeah nothing takes away my love when I let you go"" Ugh, all this talk about ""letting go"". DH was 28 when we got married. We had lived 5 hours way from her for like 6 years at this point

""Cause you’re my baby, always will be"" Blehhhhh. DH might be the youngest but you definitely don't treat him like your baby.

""Some years down the long long road if you need help with your load I’ll always be here for you, you know"" Vomit. MIL will be there for him because obviously me as his wife won't be there for him. Let's not even get into the fact how unsupportive she is of DH now.

Best part of this story? DH was supppppper drunk by the time this dance rolled around and doesn't remember a second of it."
85,We buried a toxic person today,phytoarch,0,16,125,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536117721.0,9d2l4b,"Well my toxic JNgrandma finally died and we had the dog and pony show (her funeral) today.  I expected from the beginning that it would be a (excuse my language) shit show.  It seems that being dead hasn't stopped her screwing with us (Surprise surprise). 

&#x200B;

Before I get to the meat of this story I should share some family history first.  We all hate each other and have been feuding for decades.  Most of the issues each of us have with each other stems from toxic grandmas lies, triangulation and gaslighting.  She loved pitting her kids against each other to see who loved her the most.  She made up outrageous lies, was emotionally abusive and always acted the victim.  Grandma has four kids, Uncle 1 and 2, JNdad and Aunt 1.  All of them have, on occasion, been NC with her.  Uncle 1 spend most of his life being either NC or LC with her.  Aunt 1 was NC with her for over ten years and then more than a year on two later occasions.  JNdad and uncle 2 was NC with her for almost ten years. Before becoming ill Grandma was NC with Aunt 1.  After being diagnosed all her kids became full contact, although none of them were talking to each other at all.  

&#x200B;

When she died all her kids called a temporary truce to plan the funeral together and everyone acted civil throughout he ceremony.  Of course since the entire family is JN things were pretty weird.  DH and I got there early and were immediately accosted by an army of old crones (aka grandma's geriatric FM's).  Since they haven't seen me since I was a toddler they have no idea who I am and they immediately assumed that DH is the 'family'.  It was hilarious.  They got right up in his face and demanded to know how he was related to grandma and what he was doing there.  DH looked like a scared deer in the headlights and I literally had to swoop in and save him.  

&#x200B;

Then we got to got to deal with some verbal abuse (aka jokes and compliments) from my JN cousins. They are all BEC aged beauty queens and happily commented on how old I look (eyeroll cause I'm years younger than them and look it). Of course just as I thought it couldn't get worse Food Thief (my JNmom) showed up (sigh).  She swooped in and decided to 'introduce' me to family friends and relatives (most of whom I don't know thanks to feuds).  She was damn rude the entire time.  At one point she dragged me to a family friend and went: ""OP this is \[family friend\].  Do you remember her? She's the one with the retard kid.""  She said this while standing next to the poor woman and I wanted to die of shame (the woman's kid is mentally and physically disabled). 

&#x200B;

Finally everyone is told to go inside for the service and I'm told to wait outside cause I'm supposed to help carry the coffin.  There is only one problem.  Nobody knows where grandma is.  Guys the old woman showed up half an hour late to her own funeral in the heaviest coffin that money could buy.  We finally heave her inside and the fun starts.  Some verses from Mark were chosen (by grandma) for the funeral sermon.   It read "" Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing to me. The poor you will always have with you,and you can help them any time you want. But you will not always have me. She did what she could.... ""

&#x200B;

The pastor spun a happy story about how good grandma was and how she did everything she could for her family.  It was ridiculous and one last, very obvious, guilt trip.  I happily made my own version of the sermon that used the same verses ""Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing to me."" (She's the victim don't you know.  Everything she did was perfect and wonderful (sarcasm).  ""The poor you will always have with you,and you can help them any time you want. But you will not always have me. "" (Focus on me.  I'm the most important person.  How dare you have a life of your own?) ""She did what she could.... "" (...to us.  She did what she could to us. She destroyed everything she touched, including her family.)

&#x200B;

I'll admit several people got a bit misty and sad during the funeral (I blame it on the guilt trip music).  Well all sadness went away when her will was read directly after the service.  She left everything to (drum roll please) FM aunt 1.  And I mean everything.  Her other kids didn't so much as get a sentimental photo or a token item that said mommy loves you.  She left them nothing at all, which off course has sparked a whole new feud and everyone has gone back to NC. Thanks so much for the weaponized will grandma.

&#x200B;

I should note here that I wasn't there for the reading (cool brother told me what was said later), I was outside being harassed by one of Food Thiefs FM's.  Guys she got right in my face, not two minutes after we left the church, to hiss at me about how rude and disrespectful I was towards Food Thief.  My sin? A few weeks back Food Thief tried to come over uninvited.  She called me when she was almost at my place and demanded a visit.  I told her I wasn't home and reminded her that she needed to call ahead of time to organize a visit and she couldn't just show up when it pleased her. 

&#x200B;

Well Food Thief's FM went off on me about how rude it was to say that to my mother and how much I'd hurt her feelings.  She went on and on about how lonely my mom was and how she just wanted to see me.  She told me I was inconsiderate.  When I pointed out how inconsiderate Food Thief's behavior was she told me Food Thief didn't mean to be inconsiderate.  She flat out told me that Food Thief was an impulsive person and I should accept that.  ""Its just how she is."" FM kept saying.  Then she tried to guilt me into having Food Thief over to my place the next day to make up for my behavior.  I shut that down very fast and told her that I wasn't unreasonable for wanting some advanced notice before Food thief just showed up.

&#x200B;

Where was Food Thief during this convo?  She was silently standing next to her FM looking sad.  She heard everything said but was happy to let FM speak for her while she looked sad.  After the convo I dragged DH away to leave.  

&#x200B;

One good thing did come from the funeral.  I finally found out which of grandma's flying monkeys were messaging me pretending to be her.  It was FM aunt 1 who inherited everything.  I've now blocked her.  NC sweet NC.

&#x200B;

Ps.  I banned DH from telling Beelzebaby about grandma dying or the funeral.  I didn't feel like consoling a crying Beelzebaby this time (see BB for story about Beelzebaby and how she handled previous deaths in my family)."

Apparently he considers my mom dropping me off at school to be the first vacation he’s had in years. No kids, no wife, just him and the pets. He flew off the handle when my mom told him it was my sister’s home too and he couldn’t bar her from it.

Now, I've drank with this group of friends many times and I think they know I'm not, but now they might be questioning If i'm lying to them or not. I also recently had a friend about three months ago die of an overdose.

[However, they wasted no time in shitting all over my new job.](https://ibb.co/bvy19e)

That lovely email of congratulations was from my alcoholic N/Edad. I’ve posted about Nmom in JNM. All they did was make me keep them in the loop and then shit all over everything. Even if they made valid points, my goal was to get away from them. It’s so bad that I was willing to risk whatever my sperm donor addressed in that email. Even when my friends agreed with it.

I get to the job, and wrongly assume that it’s as lax as they were here. I could walk in after 2 hours like “lolz I forgot” and theyd be like “k cool”. Not that I did it here. Just on a couple of occasions that I was too depressed to get out of bed. And I also casually mentioned that my parents were crazy N’s. 

I’m maybe 1-2 weeks in when one of the other project managers sends out a blast email stating that there was bad feedback on me. Something that wasn’t addressed with me prior. It felt like an ambush. The “I have crazy nparents” comment apparently constituted “oversharing inappropriate personal details.” 

If you guys want “inappropriate personal details,” I’ll gladly go into graphic detail about my sex life, and how I hate Jenny. I said nothing along those lines. So I get a talking to about it, and seemed to be humored when I protested that nobody ever addressed anything with me ever. This job had me crying on the way there, the drive back to the company paid apartment, where I was roommates with the girl who sent the email, and in my own apartment.

I eventually confronted the girl who sent the email/my former roommate. She was fake when she said she thought I already spoke to our regional manager about it. And she would constantly tell me that “so and so doesn’t like your work hehe.” I AM FUCKING TRYING.

Despite all this, I begged to stay. I tried to improve. I was willing to take this over returning to the N’s. But was unfairly terminated. It’s easy enough to say that that email and lack of support from the N’s messed up my psyche. That I was trying, and willing to improve. But I will be accused of shifting the blame no matter what. 

I could have worked on not being late. I could have sought a therapist in that state even if I was only gone a month. I was already trying to learn a new computer system to document, which they unfairly expected me to know in a matter of days. Something which was so unforgivable. Glassdoor reviews on the company address these issues too. 

I gave them a piece of my mind on an exit survey. I was never heard out, always treated unfairly, and scapegoated. While my roommate was the GC of the company. Yet I still wanted to stay, and not go back to the N’s. The 4 month period of unemployment that followed haunts me, and I’m currently in another job in unhappy with.

91,Downtrodden Donna and the Big Gulp,horsesarecool1234,0,8,59,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536100057.0,9d0e3q,"This story is from back when my fucking idiot of an EXH let his mommy (ChickenLady) trot him down to the attorney's office and file for divorce. She accused me of a litany of felonies that I did not commit and they were some straight up ripped-from-the-headlines shit. Needless to say, defending oneself from stuff like that takes a LOT of time and sadly a lot of money. Due to having been basically held captive by ChickenLady and her brood for several years in a new town, I did not have a support system at ALL. 

Cue my JNmom Downtrodden Donna. Donna was positively drooling with excitement when she booked her ticket to come ""help me"" while I sorted through the shit show. Things got off on a typically dysfunctional foot when she arrived and was very depressed that I had not roasted her a fucking chicken, because she had been looking forward to it. I mean, why let a horrendous divorce filing I received 24 hours prior get in the way of my regular cooking schedule, right? She never even mentioned wanting chicken, so this was also another failed attempt at mental telepathy on her part. Anyway, it only got worse and Donna spent countless weeks in my home somehow hijacking the sadness and fear that I was going through and taking it on as her own, all while calling her sisters and complaining about it very loudly. I had no other option but to let her stay, as EXH had left me broke and with no childcare options whatsoever. 

Obviously the longer Donna stayed, and the more of her nauseating passive aggressive garbage I was forced to listen to, the more I had to avoid her. I couldn't afford to go apeshit on my only form of childcare while I was going to a zillion lawyer meetings and emergency coparenting sessions and all sorts of other jazz that the courts make you do when your insane MIL accuses you of full blown crimes you've never heard of before. So, the case progresses and we finally get some dates set for mediation. I had gotten idiot EXH to drop the violent accusations because they were, well, literally made up by a fucking maniac, but the custody situation was getting very contentious. Of course, ChickenLady wanted my kid and raging momma's boy EXH will stop at nothing to make that beast happy, so it was a very scary awful mess at the time. My nerves were absolutely toast.

I tell Donna the dates of the mediation in person and via email. Donna, who is the most anal person ever, has never forgotten the date of any event in the history of the world. Fast forward through several more weeks of me living with Donna's incessant PA bullshit and obnoxious Book Of Faces comments from her harpy sisters that I blow off because I can't start problems with Donna or else I am fucked. A couple of days before I need to go into this mediation to keep custody of my kid, Donna fucking springs this on me... She was leaving the next day to go fly across the country to help my GC sister pack her apartment and move a whopping 10 miles across town, and would not be returning in time to help watch DD while I go through the mediation.  What?! (For the record, GC sister is a normal person in her 30s and totally capable of packing an apartment without her mother) Donna has a laundry-list-sized record of sabotaging my life in the most hideous ways, but I stupidly thought she would never stoop so low as to jeopardize my custody of DD, since she is obsessed with DD. Nope. Donna was leaving and ""Sorry, I'm sure you'll figure SOMETHING out!"" was what her ass thought I would accept as an apology. I remember this moment of my life clear as day, because I have never felt so absolutely abandoned and for some reason it was then that I finally realized my own mom fucking hates me. Donna, as she is telling me this, is behind the wheel of her car in front of my house. Of course she tells me devastating news while in the car, so she can drive away as some sort of asshole punctuation or little bitchy flourish to accentuate how she can just abandon me when she fucking feels like it. Not this time, Donna. I was drinking a huge ass Big Gulp coke at the time, and I snapped. I threw that damn soda so hard at her head that it ERRUPTED all over her face and the inside of her car. I still smile when I think about it. She was obsessed with that car, and apparently it was never quite the same again. Sadly she does not have to deal with the coke splatter anymore because her car got stolen (the tale of Donna's car is another post in itself because she somehow dragged the entire neighborhood into it and caused a very unfortunate racial profiling debacle). This story ends somewhat anti-climactically with me texting Donna to fuck herself and taking whatever stuff she had in my house and throwing it on the porch, only to have her return hours later still soaked in coke to retrieve it while wailing and causing a commotion for the neighbors to leer at.

The next time I saw Donna's busted ass was when I stupidly went to visit \[hometown\] for a while that summer and she stole my fucking blender."
92,Update to Memory Loss - DD2's Birthday and You've Got Mail,ImaginationCalls,0,11,180,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1535991218.0,9cmqro,"I'm naming my MIL Rose-Colored Glasses (RCG) unless it's been taken. She tends to look at all her behavior, no matter what, through these.

Due to weather, we moved DD2's party from the place we always have it to another location. This turned out to be a good thing. SIL came (invited) to the party bearing a large envelope full of smaller envelopes. All from RCG. Along with those, the information that yep - RCG had planned to just come to the party anyway. Thankfully, SIL told her party had been moved and would not say where, so we didn't have to deal with that.

I didn't tell DH about the envelope of envelopes until after the party and we'd gotten home. He opened it and found the following enclosed:

* Birthday card for DH (from July)
* Birthday card for DD2
* Birthday card for me
* Back to school cards(?) for DD1 and DD2, with $20 cash in each(?)
* A letter in a sealed envelope for DH
* An open letter with a weird clipart image on the side on cardstock

Not included - any form of card or gift for DD1's birthday WHICH WAS IN APRIL.

DH gave the girls their cards. I have chosen not to open mine and it will either be mailed back or ... ? IDK. I don't want her money. DH didn't open his birthday card but he did open the letter that was so full of rugsweeping rainbows and unicorns and POOR ME's that he almost didn't make it through the first paragraph. First, I will tell you what that weird clipart cardstock letter said:

\[DH\],I gave birth to you but you can with no instructions. All I knew was that I loved you long before I saw you. I know I made some mistakes and for that I am sorry, but I was doing the best I could with what I knew. Everything I did for you, I did from love. You are my child, my life, my dreams for tomorrow. I will always LOVE you and there is nothing that could destroy my love for you. Love- Mom

Got it? Cool. Onto letter #2, which I will add my own commentary to in parenthesis)

Dear \[DH\],

​

I really do not know what to say any more. I can understand about the \[phone company\] bill that I will continue to say I never received. *(This proving that she really still thinks this is about the goddamn money/credit score and it's NOT, it's about her refusing to acknowledge that it ever happened, that she was ever made aware of it, and her lying.)*  My question is; why you didn't say anything back in 2006*. (Well, probably because it fucking happened in 2012*?) It would have been taken care of*. (Just like all your other bills, right, RCG*?) I am paying you this back whether you want it for not. Enclosed is t he $145.00*. (It was actually $150, and STILL BESIDES THE FUCKING POIN*T) I never want to owe my kids money*. (She has asked to borrow thousands from both DH and SIL*.) So for me this is the end of the \[phone company\] conversation*. (Okay...*?)

I don't know if you realize this, I am not one to hold grudges. My problem is that I care too much at times. There are also times that I will trust the wrong people and get burned *(We know the feeling, girlfriend.*) I also will have to learn lessons the hard way. What I am saying is that I am not perfect *(ROFL)*. I am far from being perfect. You and \[SIL\] are my world. I always tried to do my best when it came to raising you two. To this day I feel I did the best I could. Again I will tell you that I am not perfect. I know I made some mistakes.

I want to tell you that I am sorry if I did wrong while you were growing up. I worried way too much. I had an extremely hard time of letting go. I love you more than life itself So for that I am sorry. I miss talking to you. I miss our friendship. I miss my son. I miss my daughter in law. I always wanted to be close with her *(hard pass)*. When I saw what you were dealing with, I wanted so bad to be there for you *(I recently have had some health issues, none of which would have been aided by her ""help"")* both. I wanted to be there with you when \[ImaginationCalls\] went through surgery *(there have been many - which time?)*. I wanted to help with \[DD1\] and \[DD2\]. All you had to do was pick up the phone and tell me you needed help. I would have been there for you*. (This makes me think maybe she thinks we are upset that we didn't have her help? IDK. We had plenty of help and were certainly fine*.) If I am such a bad person, do you think \[SIL\] would have me babysit \[Nephew2\]  when she went ba*ck to work? (Side story: SIL had to actually last-minute find someone else to babysit after a few weeks bc RCG wasn't changing him often enough even after SIL asked her to multiple times and Nephew2 wound up with terrible rashes and yeast issues, but those RCGs must have omitted that fact from her mind.) Do you think she would trust me enough to take \[Niece\] and \[Nephew1\] to school or get them on the bus? (SIL needs help with this stuff, and Niece is *almost 10 so...) I would love to have the same close relationship with you and \[ImaginationCalls\]. I want to be close with \[DD1\] and \[DD2\]. I want to come to things they have at school. Not once since they have started school have I been invited to anything they have participated in or when the*y have received awards. (Fake news. She has been invited 4 times. One she was so late the event was over before she arrived. 3 times she flaked completely AFTER promising my gi*rls she would be there). All I am guilty of is loving my family with all my heart. I am guilty of wanting to be in your life. I never understood when my mom would tell me that she loved me more than y*ou know until after she passed away (Yep. You'll* die one day. We know. Subtle, RCG.) I learned that no matter what a Mother's love never dies. I\[t\] goes on forever. So no matter how mad you are and no matter how long you will hold this grudge, I will always love you more than you know.

Love you! Mom

So wow. DH doesn't know what he's going to do with the $. He's hurt and upset that she doesn't get it and mad she is trying to guilt him. I'm worried this is only going to escalate over the holidays.

Anyway, I'm hoping SIL will no longer be playing messenger. She seems like she doesn't understand DH's stance either and IDK if it's him not articulating it clearly enough (I consider myself fluent in DHnese but even I get lost at times) or she's got her own set of glasses."

So is DH's sister and her husband. We're all pretty low-contact due to toxic behavior from ILs and the fact that they're socially inept and we all gave up trying to have a good time with them.

So a few weeks ago, apparently SIL and MIL had a big fight about politics. MIL's standard MO is to post bullshit conservative articles that are insulting and unfounded attacks against strawman liberals, get defensive, and then claim she was ""joking"" if anyone calls her out on the bullshit. SIL has a bit of a temper (but it's justified) and called her out, MIL passive-aggressively posted more articles calling democratic socialism stupid (If you knew basic math you would know socialism doesn't work, except the only ""math"" we provide is super skewed statistics about Venezuela). SIL snapped and told MIL off for being a cunt, and messaged us about it to warn us in case we talked to her and made a fuss about it. Also for solidarity bc DH and I had already spent the evening before complaining about the idiotic article.

Aaaaanyway. Fast forward a couple weeks, we have a scheduled dinner for FIL's birthday (big decade milestone). Family from out-of-state is going to be here (I've never met even though we've been married for 5 years), so kinda obligated. After suffering through banal conversations about TV shows I don't watch and never will watch (and have made clear I'm not interested in), MIL can't help but make repeated jabs about how DH was the ""easy"" child, and his sister was ""difficult"" growing up. Literally every non-TV-related conversation is not-subtle shade and I'm over it.

But then! The big kicker comment? ""You guys don't take me too seriously, right? You know I'm only joking when I post those articles"". I could not have head-desked louder (mentally). She is so passive aggressive and takes exactly ZERO responsibility for anything she does or says, and claims all her insults are just ""jokes"". I can't, folks. I just can't any more."
94,Ndad’s flying monkeys RSVPed yes to the baby shower this Sunday,liedownwithdogs,0,5,3,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536142661.0,9d53my,"hi everyone. been in this community for a while now, just created this account to keep it separate from my main. thanks in advance for whatever advice and support you guys can give, i’ve been feeling pretty edgy about these two flying monkey-related issues I have.

the overall situation/background: 
i am experimenting with VLC and an information diet with my Ndad, it’s been a couple of months now. We live in the same city and he’s still married to my mom (who has surprisingly grown out of her Emom’s past of enabling and is now pretty supportive, considering) otherwise I would be completely NC with him. I’m in my thirties and live with my spouse, who is my
rock and protector against these toxic people.

Still, I know for a fact that Ndad has been peddling his “woe is me, my daughter hates me” bullshit all over town, especially to his female siblings. He also recently had minor surgery that (surprise surprise) he has been milking for all it’s worth, and I haven’t said shit bc i don’t fucking care.

—Problem number ONE:
 this sunday i have to attend a family baby shower (not mine) without my spouse, and I am already filled with so much dread about the flying monkeys that will no doubt descend on me, just like they always do. 

——Advice request ONE:
I could really use some helpful deflection tactics and ways to brush off their barbs without letting them sink in. Fwiw, I’ve been in therapy for the past year and working on my boundary strength. It’s been helpful but I still struggle with sticking to the script for moments like these, and I don’t want to give them any kind of reaction whatsoever.

— Problem number TWO:
the expectant family member is due right around christmas, and she’s been hosting Christmas Eve dinner for the past few years. This dinner is a horrific triggering nightmare of endless narc bullshit. Before I found out about the due date, I was planning to skip it altogether because I am fucking DONE. But now, since I’m in the same town, of a similar age, and have a spouse and home of my own, I can imagine all of these flying monkeys champing at the bit to demand that I host this year. It’d be right in their wheelhouse to corner me at this baby shower and make their ridiculous expectations known.

—— Advice request TWO:
I am gonna need all the help i can get to make my “no” loud and clear without lying, making excuses, or being vague enough that I end up kicking that can further down the road. I also want to stay interactive and grey rock so that they don’t latch onto whatever I say and fly into a rage.

Nothing has happened yet because I have been staying off their radar ever since I realized what my family put me through, but the anticipation of Sunday’s baby shower has me completely dialed up to eleven.

So, what do I do? If my aunts say “your father misses you, why are you so mean to him, can’t you see he loves you” or “maybe it’s your turn to do something for this family for once and host christmas eve” I need to have some responses in hand so I can breezily rattle them off in the moment and keep it fuckin moving. I’m not a great liar and I’m pretty awkward at changing the subject, but if I have some concrete things to practice for the next four days I think it’ll help.

and yes, I already thought about skipping or faking an illness, but my mother is cohosting and she doesn’t have the wherewithal to lie on my behalf. she’s still pretty trapped in the FOG when it comes to her own relationships with these people and I don’t want to involve her in my own recovery. 

plus, this may be a useful and productive opportunity for me to practice what I’ve been working on in therapy before the holiday season rolls around this year. hooray for silver linings? i guess?

So, RBN redditors: got any advice? if so, what worked for you? or, what didn’t work? I hope you can help me, thanks for always being such an awesome and supportive community.

—TL;DR— 
i need advice for ways to non-confrontationally change the subject, deflect emotional barbs, and otherwise ignore my Ndad’s flying monkeys at a family baby shower this Sunday. see numbered problems ONE and TWO (and their corresponding advice requests) above to get the specifics. Thanks."

96,"Falsetto Fiona ""told me so"".",justhereforjustno,0,56,166,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1535997907.0,9cnpek,"I posted yesterday about the mostly BEC bullshit with Falsetto Fiona at my parents' house Saturday. As promised, here's the story of how DD choked and Fiona managed to be even more annoying about it.



So, 9 month old DD was in her [bumbo seat](https://www.amazon.com/Bumbo-B10056-Floor-Seat-Blue/dp/B0092NNQ98) eating mandarin oranges and playing with an ice cube my sister gave her. She's had ice before and never really had a problem with it, plus the piece wasn't that big. 



Falsetto Fiona makes a comment about it being too big and I reply, ""She's fine, she's had them plenty of times before,"" and of course, within *literally 2 seconds* DD is making that horrible gagging face with her eyes bugging out. 



*Important information: I am first aid/CPR/AED certified for infants, children, and adults. My dad used to be a paramedic, still works in a related field, and teaches first aid/CPR/AED classes regularly. Some of you remember that Falsetto Fiona used to be a nurse once upon a time. According to the American Heart Association, the procedure for a choking infant is to first sweep your finger to try to dislodge the object. If that doesn't work, you hold the infant facing down, about a 45 degree angle to the floor, and perform hard back blows between the shoulder blades until the item is dislodged (or professional help arrives, if needed). This information is relevant, I promise.*




I sweep DD's throat with my finger, no dice. I whip her out of the bumbo and try to turn her upside down. She keeps trying to lift her head, she's heavy, I'm also trying to beat her back, so it's difficult. Fiona gets in my face and screams, ""You have to put her head down!""  So I yell back, ""That's what I'm trying to do!"" I'm trying hard not to panic at this point. 
 


DD's making this awful sharp, wheezy, inhale every 5ish seconds, which is terrifying but at least I know she's getting some air.



I'm making zero progress so I say, ""Dad-"" and try to pass her, very clearly to my dad and around Fiona, who is standing between me and my dad. Fiona practically rips DD from my arms and holds her facing down but parallel to the floor and just hits her really hard on her lower back like 3 times. It looked like she was just spanking her.



DD is now obviously panicking more, time is passing, so I yell, ""Just give her to dad!!"" Fiona hesitated for a split second but complied. My dad grabs DD and starts following the actual first aid procedure for a choking infant. It's not working, so I get down in front of DD's face while Dad was still following first aid, and I shove my finger as far back as I can into DD's throat to try to see if I can feel anything. She swallowed hard, inhaled with a sharp cry, and started gasping. 



Dad handed her to me and she reeled for a bit trying to recover. She was breathing and just needed to calm down at this point and was trying to pull my shirt off to get at my boobs. 


Then Fiona starts panicking  and yelling that she's not okay yet, she's still choking because, ""her mouth is blue!! She's blue around her mouth!"" DD was pale around her mouth, *because she was just fucking choking*, but she wasn't blue. Her breathing had calmed and she had calmed down, so I just ignored Fiona, snuggled DD close and then nursed her a few minutes after. We ended up discovering she choked on a combo of ice cube and mandarin orange.



It was absolutely terrifying. Everyone was really quiet after and seemed to think it was my fault. My mom called it ""a learning experience"" in a very condescending tone.  My brother ended up joining us later, my mom recounted the tale, and my brother came to me and said ""I heard we almost lost my niece tonight."" Totally blaming me. Wonderful. 


But Fiona, the rest of the night, kept looking at me and shaking her head saying, ""I just *knew* that ice cube was too big...""  I get it, she fucking told me so. By the end of the night, I'm surprised my optical nerves were still attached from all of the eye rolling I was doing. 


As if she and creepy FIL weren't enough to deal with, I left that night feeling like the world's worst mother. And she only made it worse. I nearly had a break down in the car on the ride home. I feel  better now, but I'm still fucking annoyed."

He was threatening to leave and move back to his former home state and saying he'll leave Chachi for BIL to take care of. That he didn't do anything wrong, that cousins fiancée and i are lying white trash and incorrectly claiming that our fathers abused us. His daughter backed him up and got in SIL's face, calling her a liar. Chachi blamed the entire thing on SFIL's alcohol problem. BIL and SIL want to help her get out of her marriage and offered to bring her with them-she decided to stay with her molester husband and his complicit daughter. He is in jail right now and while i am horrified that SIL was victimized by him, i feel so validated. See bitch?! I'm not a liar, my dad didn't abuse me, and I'm not fucking white trash.

99,NDad threatening me while we’re on holiday.,sighnra,0,1,4,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536128779.0,9d3r3e,"Throughout the holiday, my dad and I have been fine and we were always somewhat close but the other night I [15f] came back to the room drunk and he threatened to kill me, stop giving my weekly allowance and yelled at my friends who had helped walk me back. Since then he didn’t talk to me and essentially banished me to either stay in my room or his sight within the hotel which I found so unfair; this is my holiday too. So, I asked if I could at least go see my friends again, and around the family pool grounds, he threatens to hit to me.

I understand that I shouldn’t have been drinking and apologised for it later on, but his reaction was just so uncalled for, and it doesn’t stop there. My sister wants to go sit in the lobby bar as she isn’t tired and my dad agrees to letting us go (we have barely started talking again by then). Long story short, my friends joined us and they left one by one until I was left with a male friend and my sister. Here, my dad walks down, tells us to come back in a seemingly calm voice, until we reach the elevator and he says: “For someone who has a boyfriend, you do talk to a lot of boys.” Now, this really pissed me off, he knew there was another girl in our friend group (only 5 of us) and even my SISTER was there. I replied with, “Why are you getting so annoyed?” considering how he’s overreacting to honestly one little thing, to which he replies, “I’m done with you.”

What the f*** am I supposed to do now?"

Before my dad started yelling, he'd slam his fork down on his plate or thunk his glass down on the table. My mom would scooch her chair back suddenly so it screeched on the tile. I'd listen for these noises to know when the big fight was going to erupt. If I was still sitting at the table, that was my cue to leave as soon as I could.

To this day, those sounds - a metal fork being clunked down on a plate too hard, or a glass being thunked down on a table, or the sound of a chair scooting back against tile - these sounds still make me jump and kickstart my anxiety even in completely normal/innocent contexts.

Anybody else have an experience like this?

So we left off with Jumble leaving an emoji filled nasty jumble of a comment to a recipe video that SO posted on my facebook wall weeks ago. She said ""Diet and gym is more tasty!"" in reference to SO’s weight. This isn't the first time she's said some unbecoming remarks about SO or our relationship either. We usually brush it off because we're already over her shit, but this instance was the straw that broke the camel’s back. We're already pretty LC with her because of her past behavior, but she seems oblivious (not sure if this is on purpose or she's just that dense).


 (Check u/nugmast3r and u/cosmikd3bris for her past antics and context) 


My dad came over yesterday to help us with some house things, and I sat him down afterwards.
I touched upon a LOT of different things in our talk- her cruel comments, her unsupportive behavior, her manipulation, her racism, her paranoia that everyone is out to get her and is jealous of her, her materialism, her feelings of superiority for anyone different. I told him that her version of love is buying me things I don't need or want, and saying ""I loooovveee you"". Her actions never conveyed love though, they were all about dressing me up to be “perfect” in her eyes (old man clothes). She didn’t do normal parental things like attend important school functions (I was very musically active) or show interest in my hobbies. She was consumed with her work and drinking wine. She wasn’t the primary bread winner and spent her paychecks on more materialistic and unnecessary [things](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/8ses88/jumbleliar_doesnt_want_me_to_buy_lotion_for_her/). At the end, I stated that she is blocked on FB and we will be NC with her until she receives professional help (therapy) for her plethora of issues. Once she shows signs of improvement and understanding of her behavior, I will entertain a full apology detailing the damaging things that she's done, why these things are wrong, and the action she will take to ensure that these behaviors do not happen again. If she chooses not to do this, then she chooses to not be a part of my life moving forwards.  


Initially, I thought it best if I just don't see her or talk to her until she does these things. However, I reflected and thought it best if she heard these things from me directly instead of using my dad as a middle man. I love my dad, and he was a positive influence throughout my entire life. However, he was very much a rug-sweeper and enabler. I learned these behaviors from him and have worked hard to change. I’m finally at a place in my life where I’m able to call out bullshit, and not rug sweep or enable behaviors. I have a ways to go, but SO would agree that my spine has quite a shine to it nowadays. I thought things would be better coming directly from me since he has a tendency to downplay things and defend Jumbe…. Little did I know how right I was.


Anyhow, I emailed my dad and said we should have a sit down where I would tell her my feelings and where we standing with our relationship. Here was my original message:


“Hey Dad,

Upon further reflection, I think we should arrange a time for SO and I to come over to talk with mom. I'm basically going to say most of the stuff I said to you, but directed at her. I expect her to deflect and deny, but I will lay down my contingency for having a relationship with me moving forward. She needs help, and getting it is the only way I will entertain an apology and future relationship with her. Are you two available toward the end of the week?

Love, 
OP”


He responded this morning with this rug sweepy mess: 


“G'morning Son, This sounds like a great idea, any attempt at communication will enable greater understanding. I'll run it by Mom today and get back to you. I would ask to replace the expectation for deflection and denial on Mom's part with the premise that love, patience, and understanding are the greatest healing forces available to us. Also recognize that all our perceptions are influenced by our beliefs about self, others, life, etc. ultimately meaning that each one of us lives personal 'realities', schema with our own modifications, expectations, and limitations. Let's make our conversation educational and respectful, not accusatory. I would also ask that before you preformulate any contingencies for moving forward, that all of us be open to what this conversation will reveal, we need to unpack with each other our personal realities. I feel the results can have therapeutic potential for all of us.

Mom and I have talked extensively since the 'recipe' incident and I have come to gain new perspectives regarding some of the issues you and I had talked about. I have also been very clear where I think Mom has been outright wrong, judgmental, prejudicial, and inappropriate. Nevertheless, I also recognize that Mom is a person of great compassion who loves you with all her heart and in her unique(sometimes equivocal) way has always tried to act with your best interest in mind. 

Yes, over our respective lifetimes there have been glitches, mistakes, wrong turns, pains, and hurt; however, how we overcame/overcome these difficulties determines in large degree who we are. Today, SO, you, Mom and I are fortunate to have health, happiness, beautiful homes, fulfilling employment, and loving companionship. These are blessings not afforded to all. We have much to be grateful for.

Again, thank you for the gesture of getting together to talk, this is taking the 'higher path'.

Love, Dad”


I was very disappointed in his reply. We’ve been down this road before where I’ve confronted her, she’ll cry, say she’s sorry, say she loves me, and then is forgiven (and maybe feels attacked somewhere in the middle of all this). Her behaviors don’t change, it’s just a song and dance to her. It’s like Saddam’s “I can change” song in South Park The Movie. Dad’s reply makes it seem like we’ll get all the therapy that she needs by sitting down and talking to me, and that one interaction will fix everything so stuff can go back to normal. Rug-sweeping at it’s finest. I felt like we were already getting of course, so I replied with this:


“Dad, I'm not going to have a back and forth here or sugar coat the reason for this talk. This isn't going to be a conversation about understanding her personal reality. This is a conversation about how I as an individual and SO and I as a couple have been treated poorly and aren't going to ignore, enable, or tolerate this behavior further. I listed out these behaviors in great detail during our conversation and how damaging they have been to myself and my relationships. I'm not interested in having any revelations about why she acts the way she does as her toxic behavior is something I do not want to spend another minute contemplating or dealing with. Her behavior and actions are her own responsibility and it is not my duty or responsibility to be subject to or understand them. She has been nothing but unsupportive and cruel for the duration of my adult life, even before SO. Regardless of whether or not she ""loves"" me, she shows her love in a way that is dysfunctional and damaging. She does not have my best interests in mind. She has her ideas of my best interests, but there is a big disconnect about what she believes those are and what they actually are. Regardless of what therapeutic potential this talk may have, it's not a replacement for actual therapy which Mom needs. Any forgiveness or understanding on my part is enabling this behavior, and that is something I choose not to do. I've forgiven and turned the other cheek in the past, yet nothing has changed on her end. At the end of our talk, I will reiterate the same contingency that I had told you during our talk. I will no longer speak to Mom and her cell phone number and facebook account will be blocked indefinitely until she receives professional help to deal with her plethora of issues. Once she shows signs of understanding her own behavior and changing, I will be happy to resume communication once I receive an apology containing the following: a detailed account of her damaging behavior, why her behavior is wrong, and what she plans to do moving forwards so these behaviors do not occur again. There's no wiggle room here. If she chooses not to do any of the following, then she chooses not to be a part of my life moving forward. 

Love, 
OP”


Just like JustNoMIL clockwork, I started getting some minor love bombing text messages a couple of nights ago. One every night. First one on Sunday night (the night after I talked with my Dad) said “I love you son <3, mom”. One side note, she always signs her text messages with M or Mom… as if I don’t see who they’re coming from. We got another one last night saying “I love you my son <3! Our home is your home. Love Mom”.... Just ugh. She’s clearly looking for validation which will just reinforce her shit behavior. She wants me to be like “I love you mom! You’re the best! I forgive you!”... that’s not going to happen. I’m so done with her shit. 


Just got a reply that’s INFURIATING…. I don’t even know where to begin. The deflection and rug sweeping is strong with this one and it’s maddening. I had sat down with my dad and looked him in the eye and thought he was in agreement with me on this… He did a complete 180 and UGH! Here’s his reply:


“OP, Thank you for your reply. I'd like to excerpt and comment about some of your assertions.
""I as an individual and SO and I as a couple have been treated poorly."" Looking back at the times we have had contact with you and SO, they mainly are get-togethers over meals and conversation which have been cordial and pleasant. I am not aware, outside of whatever Facebook or social media comments have been made, when Mom has overtly treated you two as a couple poorly. I'd be interested in having account of these.
""her toxic behavior"" : From my perspective, to classify Mom's behavior as toxic is excessive and shows disregard for the good times Mom has been part of. 
""She has been nothing but unsupportive and cruel for the duration of my adult life, even before SO."" Again, there is ample evidence to the contrary, but not being taken into account. All of Mom's actions have been seemingly categorized as 'toxic' so any of Mom's actions that don't fit this schema are filtered out, discarded as irrelevant. If Mom were really so cruel then that means that I have been a submissive accomplice to said course of action. I don't believe you could have been so successful in so many of your endeavors and at this point in your life enjoy love, home, wonderful pets, a lucrative job, friends were you to have been subject at our home by such toxic, damaging, and dysfunctional parental abuse. 
""Any forgiveness or understanding on my part is enabling this behavior, and that is something I choose not to do."" Not being open to forgiveness and understanding is essentially closing the door to understanding how each one of us has a part in this issue. Your stance here basically stipulates that you are completely right, can dictate the contingencies listed below, and deem Mom as the sole perpetrator of wrongdoing. That is an approach that is unfairly judgmental and obfuscates the merits and faults each one of us brings to the conversation.
Son, I don't think the conversation as structured below is the right path to follow. I'd say we all need more time, not to go back and forth or sugarcoat the issues, but instead to move forward and live life the way we are meant to- healthy, happy, and constantly exploring ways to realize ourselves.
Love, Dad”
 
 
Followed by this right after:
 
 
“Hi OP, I do have a couple of questions for you to ponder:
How is it that Mom's comment about SO's recipe has caused such a drastic change in our family relationship? Whereas prior to Mom's indiscreet, illogical Facebook comment, our times together were pleasant and cordial, now there are vows never to see or speak to your Mom again, now there is a litany of reasons why Mom should seek counselling, now Mom's motherhood for you was and is toxic, dysfunctional and damaging.
How is it that Mom's comment about SO's recipe has culminated in SO venting to Mom with the F bomb* and you Son, to my face, called Mom an asshole? I would never refer to or address a family member with such vile language, ever, and I'm disappointed hearing it from both of you.
Love, Dad”
 

*SO replied to Jumble’s comment saying “that’s pretty fucking rude”.. The HUMANITY! A bad word!


This is where things currently stand. I had a gut feeling that I would be met with denial and deflection followed by some sort of compromise, but didn’t expect it this early. I feel like the burden of understanding and forgiveness will be placed on myself and SO…. and that’s wrong. We are not in the wrong for expecting change and action on their end, and should not feel as such.


I need advice. I don’t know what to do…. I feel like I’ve lost my dad in the process of this and that he drank the kool-aid hard. There’s not two sides to this. He’s trying to give a “both sides made mistakes and we should forgive eachother” type of argument. I don’t think us using bad words (we’re fucking 30) is equivalent to half a lifetime of treating me like shit. Looking for help on how to proceed. Our end goal is to be able to have a discussion with both my dad and Jumble about how her actions have affected my and SO’s lives and to (hopefully) retain the same quality of relationship I’d previously had with my dad. We aren’t looking on advice on how to fortify our home or personal information. We don’t see Jumble and dad as those type of people. Lastly, we’ve received a lot of supportive comments from you all, and I appreciate every single one. Thanks for reading my stories, and thanks for providing support and advice during all of this shite.

102,"**Warning: Some gross stuff involving bodily functions mentioned** First love-bombing, now Nmom is saying I had the ""perfect life"" that others would have died for. Could anyone confirm if this is true? /s",Radiant_Piccolo,0,10,14,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536082072.0,9cxt2r,"In my previous posts, I was saying that I've been having issues with nMom, and have very recently gone NC. Since going NC, she has been love-bombing me, sending me one of those insipid messages from chain emails about how 'daughters are so awesome'. When I didn't reply to that, the love-bombing continued, with her complaining about how this is probably karma for her for hating her parents for making her life a misery (grandma was a major narc, and grandparents had violent arguments when my mum was a child), but that in the end 'she missed her', probably implying that I'll miss my mum too. Then today she sent me the following messages, basically gaslighting every incident of abuse she put me through. RP is me, and I've deleted my location etc. For context, she cared for my grandparents in their old age, and I did my best to help her when I came back home. And she 'pulled me out of' my problems by beating me up with her hands, various kitchen objects, pulling my hair, and having my dad join in as well occassionally, in addition to calling me names such as 'b\*tch\*, 'b\*stard' etc etc. 

&#x200B;

>**NMom**: Hi bum. I know you are angry. Maybe it is Karma. 😬I hated amma and appa when I was growing up for making my life so miserable, until she fell sick and passed away. Miss her now. Coming to **\*my location\*** on the 27th September. Hope to be lucky to catch a glimpse of you. Have a great day, today, RP. ❤  
>  
>**NMom**: Good night darling.

\*more missed calls from her, then the guilt-tripping messages\*

>**Nmom**: Past few days, It was nightmare for me. Thinking you were sick and hurt. Relieved now. Just curious, which part of 25years of your life was so bad. Maybe your first 10years. Where I had pull you out of ??autism, bed wetting, feeding problem, rashes, allergy and be there for you every single day of your life. Which dream of yours did not come thru? When was it that you ever asked to speak to the two person who gave their life for you, Appa and Amma? Did you volunteer to take care of Amma even one day. She changed your pampers and changed it to cloth pampers when you had rashes. She spend her whole day feeding you. Even when she fell sick, did you feed her even once? Did you change her soiled pampers even once? Did you bother to be there for your sister who hero worshipped you all her life? She was going thru the darkest part of her life, did you bother to at least message her or give her at least a 1 minute call? So, please don’t point at me a say I was bad. I stood by you every single part of your life. You had the perfect life, every young girl would have died for. It took you 25years of your perfect life, to say I was a bad mum?  
>  
>**Nmom**: So, all this about me being such a horrible mother? Unfortunately mothers never get to do that, no matter what. So, throw me away in your life for just asking to call home. So, Daddy and **\*my sister\*** were horrible to you too?  Because of this horrible mum, you are now a doctor qualified from UK, not even India. You got the best life compared to us and your friends. Even **\*my ex\*** had to part time to pay for his tuition. While you got a single ensuite room wit attached kitchen. Was that life so bad? Try telling your problems to your nurses, your attendance, janitors, taxi drivers and anyone you come across. Compare your life with theirs.

>**Nmom**: I am coming there on the 27th. However, not expecting anything at all from you. Staying in a cheap Hotel,  20 minutes walk from your hospital. Thanks RP for your time, in reading my message.

I will always be thankful for the opportunities that got me away from her and enabled me to seek help. However, I will never forget the abuse, and how it affects me to this day. Yes maybe I wasn't the perfect child and had issues being withdrawn at school, but why did that mean it had to be beaten out of me EVERY SINGLE DAY? Why didn't she get proper help? One can still succeed in life without being put through the abuse I went through.

103,"Depressed N Mom makes me a prisoner in my own house, and destroys any attempt I make to rebuild my mental health",Mt105,0,4,1,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536107383.0,9d1b8b,"Before I go straight into my rant I have a little background information for all of you; this is my first post after all.

&#x200B;

I grew up with a N mom, an enabler father, and an enabler younger brother. My entire family is depressed, visibly so, to the point where is had destroyed any positive aspect of their environment. To give you a few examples of the atmosphere of this house:

* My mother smokes constantly inside the house, despite the rest of the family hating it. I am also pretty sure she smoked when she was pregnant with my younger brother.
* She spends every free moment of the day on her computer playing Runescape or facebook games. Requests like ""Can you fill the dogs bowl while we are gone they need food"" get ignored. We come home two hours later to an empty bowl and she has not moved
* The entire house is a disaster zone, and the cleanliness level is zero. Things are put out and not put back, nothing is washed unless my dad does it, the ceilings and walls are stained by cigarette smoke, and the house looks like a mild hoarders episode most of the time.
* My entire family, save me, looks disheveled most/all of the time. I am talking unkempt greasy hair, holes in clothes, rare teeth brushing/showering, etc. We were not taught any kind of personal hygiene as children at all.
* Any attempt to clean or fix things is met with either no help or mild resistance.
* I have to bother people to wash their hands after using the washroom, cooking meat (I am 10 years vegetarian), or other things. I am met with an annoyed sigh, talking under their breath, and them accusing me of being a germaphobe.
* She did not pass highschool and works at a Home Depot. My father lost his business and is currently unemployed.
* I was taught no life skills at all growing up, and have had to fend for myself for the longest time.

As the black sheep of the family I got all of the flack for everything; this is true with many of you I assume. My brother is exactly like them, and is also quite meek. I don't know if meek is the right word, but he runs away from conflict in the family or any other kind of issue. A few years ago my grand mother passed away and wanted to leave each grand child $5000. My mother pocketed our money, and spent $16,000 getting the backyard landscaped. She said that she deserved a treat for herself. I was rightfully angry, but my brother said ""They raised us its the least we can do.""

&#x200B;

In any case my dad just grumbles and leaves the situation. He has stopped fighting her all together and just makes comments about her spending all of her time on the computer, or her being useless and not doing anything. He will never stand up for any of us, and a lot of the time ends up being nice or spoiling us a little bit when shes not looking. Most of the time he is grumpy and miserable though. He wants to move out to eastern Canada, and she has squashed that dream multiple times.  He jokes about dying of a heart attack shortly.

&#x200B;

When I was in highschool she started getting physical with me and I had to push her off of me. I am 6 foot 7, or 200cm for those that use metric. She told her sister, who tried to push her to get me arrested for abuse. Her side of the family shares similar characteristics to her; my cousin was in a business partnership with my dad and stole a large sum of money, cheated their clients, and sold their equipment and ruined the entire thing.

&#x200B;

**Here is a big thing:**  A few years ago I lost 145 pounds. Insane right? I was very proud of myself, and I currently look great. The only thing my mother said was that I better be sure to keep my old clothes. ""Just in case"". And she got angry when I tossed them against her wishes.

&#x200B;

It's this constant lack of support, negative attitude, and just urge to bring me down to their level that kills me. They are miserable, so I guess they feel like I have to be miserable?

&#x200B;

**So....**

&#x200B;

I could rant forever, but it is safe to say that I grew up not feeling like I was enough. I remember being told at a young age that **I am the reason the entire family fights** by my father. My mother is verbally degrading/abusive, and the entire family is negative beyond belief. This house feels like a black hole, and my most recent ex girlfriend hated being here.

&#x200B;

Last year I was away for grad school, living in my own place and I was doing much better. I had to move home for two months, as I was leaving to live in Uganda as of September 1st. That same ex girlfriend noted that I had a marked change in my personality and attitude once I moved back home. I am now back from Uganda, as of Jan 1st, and have been looking for work for what seems like forever. Since I can't find work yet, I have had to live at home and work a part time job for money.

&#x200B;

My girlfriend and I broke up because we were both doing immensely terrible mental health wise and because we needed to work on ourselves. I have been doing better, and have been developing strategies for my mental health. One big one i to tell myself that this won't be a big deal in the end. I'm stuck in traffic or cut off? No big deal I will get there eventually. Problem arises? I'll just work through it and do my best, no big deal. Part of this has been taking walks, meditating, etc. My mother recently has been paranoid about money and about gas and putting KM on the car. I had a bit of a bad evening because of a reddit interaction. Realizing it was stupid I decided to go for a hike a couple streets over - maybe like 5-10km, and I got scolded and told that I can't be using gas. She takes this tone, one that I am sure your N has their own version of, that just tends to get under your skin.

&#x200B;

This has been going on with me going to the gym, or any other kind of action I take. She makes it a point to snoop into all of myself, and ask where I am going and what I am doing at all times. If you dont cater to her whims then she has a fit and stomps around like a child. This has occurred on multiple occasions.

&#x200B;

Once I needed the car for an interview, and she said she needed it for work. I suggested my dad drive her to work, which he was okay with, so I could attend my interview. She whined and complained because *she just liked knowing that her car was sitting the parking lot in case she needed it at any point*.

&#x200B;

Baked cinnamon buns, a 3 hour process, for my friends birthday a few weeks ago. She complained , bitched, and whined that I wouldn't let her have any, and that I wouldn't make a double batch so she could have some. Smh right?

&#x200B;

My entire life has been all about her, and I am stuck here until I can find work and afford to get out on my own again. I am fighting every day to stay positive and not feel stuck, but even the atmosphere in this house is a black hole.  Being here makes me angry, frustrated, and a much worse person than I am. I am generally calm but I feel trapped. I took solace in knowing that I could leave the house, go for a hike or to the gym, but she is seemingly finding a way to trap me here more than she already has. Nobody fights her, nobody does anything, and whenever I try to stand up for anybody I become the villainized bad guy.

&#x200B;

**Questions**

* Do you have any advice based on what you have read?
* How do you step away from an N parent?
* Is there any way to improve the home life, or help the rest of the family a part from leaving entirely?
* What kind of coping mechanisms and tools have helped you mentally get over the affects of your N abuse?

I don't even know what the affects of the N abuse are, ex gf found this subreddit for me and I promised I would post. I am sorry this has been a cluster fuck, I really was unsure whether to classify this as a rant or as an advice request, but I went with advice in the end. This was mainly because I am open to any feedback you might have to improve my situation. I might not be doing it justice, and it might not seem as bad as it is, but I am having the hardest time right now.

Thank you so much"
104,"Cake Boss in ""The Social Security Card Debacle""",tabletoppineapple,0,43,655,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1535988061.0,9cmawp,"Hi fam. It's been a minute. 

I made a post about CB reusing a gift bag that I gave her by giving it right back to me, learned that I apparently can't take one critical comment over the Internet, and have been silent since then. Well, Cake Boss has been silent too, so I haven't felt the need to share anything lately. 

Here we go. 
FH and I are 26 and 27 years old, but both of our parents still hold on to our important government documents. We are getting married in less than 6 months, and as I've learned from this sub, it is best to get all of our documents in a row early to avoid crazy FMILs from lording over birth certificates and preventing their baby boys from getting a marriage license. 

At the engagement dinner where Cake Boss earned her name I gave a brief overview of plans for wedding weekend, and what Roles and Responsibilities™ the parents and siblings have volunteered to fill. I made the not so big ask of ""we will need these documents in our own possession because we need them, and because we are adults and it's time that we own that responsibility.""

Y'all. I thought it went well. There were no objections, my mother told me exactly where mine were and told me to just call her up and we could go to the bank to get them together. Cake Boss said she knew where FHs were and that she would collect them to hand over. 

There is no way that it could ever have been that easy. 

Nearly one month after that dinner Cake Boss finally decided to do the thing. She looked through the lock box in their home and found his birth certificate but not his SS card. A week prior she had been to the bank to look in the safe deposit box for something else, and it had not immediately presented itself, therefore ""it wasn't there."" 

FH and I are hanging on the couch watching a trash movie and unaware of the tornado coming our way. She sends him a wall of text stating that 1) she didn't have his SS card, 2) that he lost it, 3) this is why she always asks for it back, since he is not responsible enough to not misplace it. 

I'm a problem solver, so I ask FH if he has looked through his locked box in our home or his desk just to be certain that it is not in our possession. Followed up with the classic ""when was the last time you remember using it?"" And uncover that the last time he had needed it was when he was hired five years ago. At that time he was living with Cake Boss and FFIL and fresh from college. If he had followed her ""rules"" he would have brought it right back home and turned it over to her at that time. 

He reaches back out to her to tell her it is not in our place and to ask if she is certain that she doesn't have it. 

Cue the phone call. It's a reiteration of the wall of text exclaiming his irresponsibility, how he can't be trusted, and this is why she still has FSILs docs ( she is 30 years old, you guys.) 

*DRAMATIC REENACTMENT OF CONVERSATION AS DESCRIBED BY FH*

CB ""Well (infantilized nickname) you need your SS card to get a new drivers license. You need to take a week day off and WE will go to the SS office to get a new one. You need to have the new one mailed to MY house, and then you can pick it up.""

FH ""Mom, I'm not going to make these plans until we know it is lost.""

CB ""It is lost. You lost it.""

FH ""I do not need you to go with me to get a new one. And I don't want to have my mail sent to your house.""

CB ""Why not? Why can't your mail be sent here?""

* me in a stage whisper ""because you're a fucking adult and your mail should come you your place of residence""*

FH ""Because I don't want to drive all over town to get my mail."" (Someone teach this boy not to JADE 🙄)


It continues for quite a while until she feels she has come up with a sufficient plan for HER to help FH get a new card. I'm still sitting on the couch convinced that she has it all along, and hasn't truly looked.

THE VERY NEXT DAY

She has gone back to the bank to ""look again"" (or look for the first time in my opinion) and SURPRISE; the card has been found. It was tucked into an envelope with deceased middle sisters SS card all along (remember when I said he was a replacement child in a previous post?)

I asked him if she had apologized about the way that she spoke to him. He said that he doesn't think she realized that she had done it. 😑 I so badly want someone to put this woman into her place, but I so badly do not want to be the person to do it.

105,Stopping a leak... they always target the weak link,voltairebear,0,1,2,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536100912.0,9d0hyp,"Ughhh!!! I’m so angry right now. 

I’ve been NC (100%, no exceptions) for 3 years now. We all live in the same neighborhood and my narc goes to the large grocery store nearby. I never ever step foot in there because I know she shops there. 

My brother in law does go there and he struggles with English. He’s run into her a few times there and she always takes that as her opportunity to get info about us. 

Of course, she tracked him down today. He wants to be polite and has a hard time coming up with what to say (such as “I really need to get going, have a great day” which is what I would prefer he do...) so he gave her info about us. I’m not sure what info she got but I am just so angry. I will find out later what she asked. 

She always targets the weak link. Back when I was in contact, she didn’t even have enough respect for him to remember his name, in fact she would just call him some random stereotypical Latino name and always chose one that was not his name. 

Any ideas what I could say to him to get the point across to not give out any info? She’s gotten people fired from their jobs in the past and that’s not something I would put past her.

108,Help with husband's Ndad trying to steal his car please.,Savvy_Bean,0,9,4,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536073991.0,9cwiep,"A little background, SO's Ndad is an alcoholic, shit stain was in a bar when SO was born to his mom in a hospital alone. He is one DUI away from never having his license again. Didn't raise his kids  and now is with his babymama starting a new family.


SO had gotten caught drinking underage at a college party 2 years ago (he lives sober now, he used to drink and smoke weed like any college kid does but that is behind him) and lost his license as part of his probation to get the charge expunged. He lost his license back at the beginning of October and is getting it back in a week. 


Babymama's car broke down back in October of last year right after SO lost his license, Ndad asked SO if BM could borrow his car. SO said ""sure, she can use it til ya'll can afford a new one or I get my license back, whichever comes first. Just fix the headlight for me and we're even"". Ndad agreed and we dropped it off at Ndad's house. (I dunno why BM needed a car, she doesn't work and Ndad takes their kid to Pre-K while she sits at home and plays housewife)


Fast forward to a couple weeks ago, SO found out the date to wrap up his court case and to get his license back and sent Ndad a message on Facebook letting him know the date so he could plan accordingly. 


Now his Ndad is claiming he's put ""$2000"" into his car and he owns it. Like? bitch that shit had a new clutch, 4 new tires and new brakes on it when we gave it to you. The only thing you could have put $2000 into is fucking gas. Fuck off. We have the title and a spare key. I am firm that we will give him the date again and go when he has his license back and if Ndad doesn't hand it over we're going to court. I'll also throw out of intimidation(since I know he doesn't have the money for it) that he can pay us a few grand cash and he can have it, we'll sign over the title but he will have to buy for a fair price. 


My SO is too timid about this bc it's his abusive Ndad. Ndad hates me and won't even look me in the eye for years since our first meeting he berated my SO to the point of tears and I chewed his bitch ass out. I know he's scared of me and I'm fine with that. 


My question is how can I encourage and support SO in this situation? Does it sound like bullshit that he put ""$2000"" into a car we had in perfect condition a year ago? Anything else I should do besides what we have planned?

All the threats and abuse was over her believing I’m asking for her certificate to get married. 
Well I actually needed it for funding to do my diploma but I will also need it when the time comes that we are in a financial position to get married. 
She also blew up because we requested my bio fathers court details and DNA results so I can finally make him offical on my end. 
Her response was that she burnt them all but then her other response was “if she wants them then she can contact me for them” she being me. 
We are NC going on 8 years now and I only plan on breaking that NC when she is dead to confirm that she is.

110,"Expired Chicken, it's what's for dinner.",alexagraphical,0,17,64,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536078368.0,9cx7cx,"I leave in a matter of days now. It's the most hopeful, joyous feeling I've had in a long time. I'm trying to just keep things simple and as peaceful as possible in these last few days because when my N knows I'm doing well, she has to take me down a few pegs, and honestly I'm just so tired of dealing with that. 

Anyway, last night's dinner as disgusting as it was made me happy because this is one of the last times I'll ever have to eat meat that I know was questionably prepared. My N gets physically aggressive with me, so I have to eat what she prepares or face getting hit or having something like a knife drawn on me. You know, the usual. 

Dinner was just a pile of chicken. Literally only chicken. She only ever wants to cook a single item when she cooks, because she loves to put in minimal effort and then go on like a martyr for it. 

Normally, I cook so I have at least some control over what I eat, but she likes to cook at least once a week. 

There's a story about this chicken, because my N is an idiot and lazy. Great combo in the kitchen, right? So, we bought the chicken like four or five months ago. She let it sit in the fridge for five days before deciding that yes, we should freeze it, because we can never take my suggestions right away. So, this chicken ended up getting freezer burned. She takes it out last week and decides to thaw it in the windowsill because ""the air will move around it and thaw it very well because of physics"", and yes that's a direct quote. Then, the chicken sits in the fridge for another five or so days before she decides it's ready to cook. 

So, that was the dinner I was forced to choke down. I have horrid stomach cramps and other symptoms of food poisoning, but I've gotten used to living this way. I've gotten used to this. I'm excited that this will be one of the last times this will ever happen. I'm almost free. 

I just have to survive this last stretch and I'm out. "

It's also one of the best ways to invalidate sexual abuse survivors.

Or is it? - someone help me out here, but would I really know what invalidates me? Do I need someone else to decide whether or not I'm being invalidated? Or would you only let someone decide for you so you don't bruise their ego? \*sarcasm\*

Of course at some point I want be at peace with everything and not be thinking about it constantly. All I want is to finally be the authentic, raw version of me that just spends life actually living. But this process has nothing to do with other people. Other people do not get to decide when someone else should ""get over"" something, especially when they're the perpetrators (which really, the people who most vigorously insist you get over it are almost always the perpetrators.)"
112,"""Trauma bonding"" vs ""healthy bonding""",hashedram,0,11,92,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536044093.0,9ct875,"[Trauma bonding](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_bonding)

 I've been reading about this concept and I think this is something anyone who's facing conflicting feelings about whether they actually love their Nparents or hate them should know.

When two people have a healthy relationship, over time they do things together and bond with each other. This is perfectly normal and healthy.

""Trauma bonding"" is a perversion of this. People who experience trauma, generally tend to bond more deeply with the person most available to bonding. This is why soldiers who go into battle together bond so strongly.

Long term abusers and especially N's tend to take advantage of this.


Step 1: The N hurts the victim and causes trauma

Step 2: The N comes back later, with a different personality and validates the victim's pain and emotions. 

Step 3: The N makes sure that they are the only available source of emotional validation to the victim and isolates the victim from other healthy sources. The victim has no voice but to bond deeply with the abuser.

Step 4: Once sufficiently dependent, the N hurts the victim again and the process repeats. Only the bonding is even stronger.

I've experienced these myself and some of the common side effects are

- Not wanting to upset the N, for fear of losing validation.
- Thinking the N will change over time and their not changing is our fault 
- Feeling that they love their abuser and hate them at the same time.

This love simply isn't real. It's an illusion. And understanding that is the first step to getting away.  And for those who have gotten away and feel guilty for still wanting to go back, it's ok to feel that way. But it probably isn't real love. Real love doesn't traumatize."
113,T-Rex and the discovery of the engagement ring,commentspanda,0,14,486,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1535981762.0,9cliqg,"Just after the Christmas from hell (previous post), Future DF became official DearFiance. I initially offered to keep it a secret (although I was dying to tell people) as all his family were on my social media aside from T-Rex and he had made it clear he wouldn’t be contacting her. He was adamant he didn’t care if someone told her, it wasn’t a secret. It just wouldn’t be him. So yaaaaay I got to share photos of my pretty ring. We reassured his family it wasn’t a secret and he would tell her when he spoke to her again at some point. He was also clear  that it was no biggie if someone else told her. After about 3 months of no contact from her as she was “very very angry at his poor behaviour”, she sent her faux-pology text about it being the brain injurys fault she had no filter and couldn’t control what she said about me.  Rah. 

He deliberated for days and finally decided he would accept it at face value as an apology attempt. While it was manipulative and totally in denial that she was the problem, it was always hard to tell what her cognitive function was at any given time because of her brain injury...and it did seem she meant to apologise and mend some fences. I was clear I wasn’t ready for contact again but supported his choice. They had a few fortnightly phone calls (awkward as hell to listen to, but apparently she was telling everyone they were back on good terms) and then one weekend she texted him “can’t talk this weekend, will let you know when I’m up to it again”. Uh-oh. Nanna had let the engagement out of the bag. 

We had three more glorious months of silence after that and then a bunch of messages about how she felt bad he hadn’t told her, she was happy that he was happy and had a new life with dog and OP (yes - the dog was listed first)  and that she just wanted things to go back to normal. DF was very shiny spined and with my help on wording, he let her know things would never go back to the way they were before because her actions had forever changed things. However, he was open to moving forward from this point. 

Cue another 2 months of glorious silence. 

Eventually the texts started again and she just pretended nothing had happened and that she was starting fresh. DF is now much more reserved in his contacts with her and rarely shares personal info, he’s also elected to not allow the phone calls to start again. If she calls he just doesn’t answer. Apparently she tells the family everything is a-okay though and they are back on the best of terms. 

Bonus: the Christmas after the Christmas from hell we went overseas to avoid all family contact. A few weeks after that we found out beautiful Nanna was very sick so we went back to hometown to visit with family from all over the world. We understood T-Rex would be there - we hadn’t seen her in 14 months at this point and the last time I had seen her she’d been screaming in my face at the Christmas from hell. I promised to be on my absolute best behaviour for Nanna, although I did have some clear boundaries in place and DF knew I would clearly articulate when I was uncomfortable and move away. His extended family were on board with supporting this. My boundaries went out the window the night before though as we met up with his half brothers and the youngest (17yo now) has just been diagnosed with bi polar and was really nervous about the family thing the next day. I made the decision that no matter how much of a dick she was, I wouldn’t leave until he did. I didn’t feel the need to share that with her though. 

As we arrived to the very public space with all his family around, I gave beautiful Nanna a present of some photos of us. She (and back in the before-the-crazy-kicked-in-time, T-Rex) were the only people DF allowed to have printed photos of him. T-Rex immediately saw the photos and grabbed them off Nanna then turned to me and said “I want a copy of these, I have no photos of you both that are recent”.

My inner demon really wanted to say PLAY BITCH GAMES, WIN BITCH PRIZES!!!

Instead, i smiled serenely and said “I’m sure DF would be more than happy to arrange some reprints for you” and sailed off knowing full well that wasn’t ever happening as the ONLY reason they ever got any photos was because I printed them out. "

But somewhat more positive

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Looks like I won't have to start saving like crazy to buy a new car for the time being as my old one is actually still drivable. My NDad had called for our auto insurance to send a truck to pick it up from the body shop and he test drived it to verify if it really was *""supposedly damaged""* and nothing happened. In a way I feel cheated that this happened and that I had to cough up a decent amount of my savings just because of my actions. I could blame it on not taking my medication that day, or for panicking and allowing myself to be intimidated, but that's not responsible at all.

My car is safely home now but the driver who dropped it off didn't bother to ring the doorbell to give me back my car key or the receipt, a *huge* oversight on his part for not completing his job, so now I need to go pick it up later this week.

I admit to feeling rather guilty and I've learned my lesson in that once my internship starts next week, I won't be driving downtown myself anymore and will have to go through the dreaded park-and-ride. But this sucks as another thing my NDad will hold against me until possibly his dying breath. Just when I take a step forward in being independent, I'm dragged 10 steps back."
117,MIL trying to snake her way into babysitting when my wife goes back to work,TheBonusWings,0,38,403,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536119580.0,9d2sq4,"Approximately a month after my wife told her parents we were expecting twins MIL put in to have her work schedule changed to 4 days a week starting around our due date. Her reasoning behind this is because she will be watching them on Fridays while we’re at work. When she annouced this the next time we saw them it was news to me.  She spent the next 6 months telling anyone and everyone about how she can’t wait to watch our kids on Fridays. 

I appreciate family being will to help out for sure. The problem is that neither my wife or I ever asked her to do such a thing.  In a sub full of people bitching about their MIL, I think you can all understand my major objection is coming home to my MIL every Friday after work.  Thankfully my wife nicely told her that that was not necessary and we would figure out what we wanna do for childcare. 

A little back story on MIL, she needs to be needed. Her and FIL I’m sure are just devastated that we haven’t once asked them for help after the twins were born.   MIL’s other foiled plan was to basically move in with us for the first few weeks after they were born. 

Now that we are approaching time for my wife to go back to work the conversation is coming back.  All the peacocking she did for 6 months is coming back to bite her when people now ask her “well arn’t you watching the twins on fridays??” 

Well the day has come my wife is getting guilt tripped for the 10000th time by her parents and she tries to nonchalantly slide MIL into the Friday babysitting position when we discuss what we would like to do. Both in laws are master manipulators. Never mind I don’t want to start every weekend by seeing my MIL. Never mind she is guilt tripping her daughter. Never mind she drives me absolutely crazy. I honest to god do not believe she is capable of handling 3 month old twins for one day a week. 

Thats 6 bottles and 6 diapers in one 8 hr day. The woman sat and watched mtv for 3 hours the other day because she couldn’t figure out how to change the tv channel. And I’m suppose to trust this idiot with my kids?  I’m sure shes capable of keeping them alive, sure. But can she keep them in their routine? Hell no. "
118,"Bitter Cow has been busy over the past couple months. She managed to get herself NC with her GC and have SIL, her favorite FM call the police on her.",WashYourTaco,0,23,624,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536101570.0,9d0kwd,"I haven’t posted in a while, but a lot has happened in Bitter Cow’s world. Everything is crumbling around her and now she is desperately trying to twist the narrative that she is a poor victim in all of this. I have actually been NC with BC and her FM sisters since January of 2017, but DH is VLC with BC (he will answer if she calls him and talk to her for about 5-15 minutes once a month or so). So, BC and FIL completely ignored the fact that my DH had broken his femur and needed major surgery. They never came see him or even bother to so much as text him to see how he was doing. BC sent BIL’s wife (who was BC’s FM and I’ll refer to as SIL) to antagonize us in public to try to make DH write BC a love note on a napkin to take back to BC like we are in middle school. SIL was awful to me and DH didn’t really stand up for me in the moment, but this was only a few weeks out from his surgery and he was on crutches and pain medicine so we worked through it and the whole incident caused DH to go off on BC and told her how inappropriate that was for her to send SIL like that and how out of line SIL was. BC instantly defended SIL and told him that I was being a bitch (I literally stood there and took SIL’s treatment of me that night and never said a word which DH saw as he was next to me the whole time). DH told her that isn’t what happened and BC still tried to twist it so that we were the awful ones. This whole time however she knew that SIL was cheating on her son and behaving eratically, but was covering that up to keep up the narrative that I was a horrible person.

Well, all was quiet from her for a couple months, but SIL started posting things online that were odder than usual and I started to suspect that all was not well with her and BIL. My suspicions were even stronger when suddenly BC was texting my DH about wanting to visit (her excuse for not coming to see him once he was home from the hospital was that she and Fil were just too busy even though neither of them work and live less than 20 minutes from us) and deploying guilt tripping, “we are just so lonely it hurts!” (Basically, BIL and SIL were probably not getting along with her anymore so she needed her narc fuel from DH). DH ignored these texts. She then started frantically texting randomly asking if we were all right. I told DH that something must be going on with BIL and his wife and she was trying to shift her focus to us and make a mess in our lives since she was probably being shut out from BIL.

I only know what is going on from what BC has told DH over the phone, but BC is claiming that SIL cheated on BIL. Now, based on what SIL posted online, she was seeing someone, so I know that is true, but I also know BIL likely has cheated as well as the fact that he has an anger issue and treats SIL extremely poorly and always has. BC said that SIL told BIL that she wanted a divorce before moving out of their home. BC decided then to do what she does best and try to control the situation which always leads to her turning everything into a massive dumpster fire.

BIL needed to go out of town for work and had BC take him to the airport since SIL wasn’t speaking to him or living with him. She found out BIL and SIL’s kids (unfortunately they have several young children that get dragged through their dysfunction) were with SIL’s friend. BC then went pick up the kids from the friend and took them to BIL and SIL’s house and called her FM sisters over to help her. SIL didn’t know where they took her kids and she wasn’t living in that house with BIL since she left him for this other guy at the time claiming that BIL was abusive. SIL called the police not knowing where her kids are since BC picked them up from SIL’s friend’s house telling the friend that SIL told her to. BC and her drama loving sisters decide to take the kids to AIL1’s house. The police call FIL to find out where they are to get them to bring the kids to their mother and FIL who jumps to aggression, screaming and intimidation tactics the second he is called out for something starts going off on the officer trying to argue that Bitter Cow didn’t do anything wrong and that the kids were staying with them. Eventually BC gets the phone from him to talk to the police herself and try to turn on her poor old grandma act and at this point the police let her know that she will be charged with kidnapping if they don’t bring the kids to their mother immediately since they already talked to BIL and he said that the kids are supposed to be with SIL not BC. BC lost her mind. She called BIL screaming about throwing her under the bus and that she was helping him. He is now NC with BC.

BC tends to do really petty things all the time to make herself feel like she has won something against someone, but it usually just has the opposite effect. She has decided that BIL needs to be saved from SIL and that if she could get custody of the kids, then BIL will come back to her and leave SIL. She had AIL call CPS on SIL, saying that the house had no food or diapers for the kids. The house that SIL wasn’t living in because she had moved out. SIL had food and diapers and everything the kids needed where she had moved to. SIL and BIL are actually back together now (they are extremely dysfunctional, but DH and I knew they would likely get back together) and they are no longer talking to BC because they know she called CPS on them and was trying to take their kids. SIL’s family has also cut out BC now as well so she can’t manipulate SIL’s family into letting her see the kids either.

This all leads up to BC wailing on the phone to DH about how she is a great parent and has no idea where she went wrong with BIL, but she doesn’t have the self-awareness to realize that she couldn’t be bothered to see how DH was doing when he had a major medical emergency and hasn’t seen her in 9 months now even though they live 20 minutes away and her other kid that she babied and who’s life she tried to control is somewhat in shambles and also not talking to her. Mother of the year everyone. At least one thing will be consistent in that she won’t ever see or be around our future kid either."
119,Driving a wedge between us.,wntrwndrwmn,0,3,5,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536100237.0,9d0ew2,"So my nmom likes to divide everyone in our family as much as possible, just so she can be the hero and bring us back together again at her own will. 

This has been something that although I knew she was an n, I didn't realize she had been doing this until recently. She really knows how to pull the wool over my eyes which makes me rage... But anyways... 

She recently told me she went through my brother's girlfriend's phone while she was here visiting for the first time. She looked through all of it, including messages between her and my brother, claiming she was worried she was going to break his heart. (Bullshit because if she's going to she will, and there's nothing a mom or anyone can do about it!!!) But that was her reasoning. 

Then just today she tells me she takes and opens his bank statements that he doesn't realize he has coming through the mail still. She tells me ""I know I'm a bad mom, but I'm just worried he's going to blow all his money on this girl. Do you know he spent over 2500 dollars on her?"" And on and on talking about how he's going to go broke and be in debt. 

So I just listened and did my best to remain neutral to both parties in an attempt to grey wall that conversation. It worked, she just raged as I remarked ""Oh. Mmhm. Oh man. Yeah."" 

So now to my 

TL;DR

Do I tell my brother my mom is going through his bank statements and through his girlfriend's phone? 

The only hesitation I have, is that if he tells my mom he knows, she'll know I told him and I will be in the middle of the fire. 

It feels wrong not to tell him, but I have to protect myself too.

120,To the narcissist who will never apologize to me.,theimmigrantcheetah,0,7,58,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536124136.0,9d39xm," I have accepted in my own way, over these past few months, that I will never receive a genuine apology from you. I'll tell you, it has been a hard truth to face. What happened between us is one of the most painful things to have ever happened to me. Some days, I still sit in the shock of it all. The disturbing truth of who you turned out to be was something that literally made me physically ill and something that is still so hard for me to comprehend.

The day I realized that I will never hear a true apology from you, I gained valuable knowledge and the ability to find closure within myself and not you. I will not spend the rest of my life waiting for that apology. I refuse to give another piece of my life to you. What is helpful to me is knowing and accepting that you are just one of those people, and I am not.

One of those people who hurts others deeply, and is so ashamed by your own actions, you can never truly own up to them. Because to do so would be an attack against your ego, your self-esteem, and your self-worth the way YOU see it and feel it. To do so, would mean more self-loathing for you and more demons within to fight. Admitting you were wrong is an attack against yourself, and you already so fragile and weak. You are already to the point of trying to destroy other people like you have destroyed yourself.

I will not demand an apology from you any longer, or that you fix the situation. I won't confront you with your despicable actions any longer. I already know you will have a painful life with the path you are headed on. I won't seek to hurt you back. Karma is real, but it's not my job to see that it gets served. It's not my job to force apologies out of you, to force you to do your own internal work that needs to be done.

I will never be the person who gets you to see your mistakes and make changes. The only person who could ever do that is you.

Thank you for the 5 years of friendship. 5 years of hard lessons and painful truth. It's over now, and in letting go of the apology that will never happen, I have regained my life.

A life spent waiting in that dark place for your apology is a life wasted away.

This morning as Nmom was driving me to the airport, there was complete awkward silence. No talking. Nothing.  (She’s upset that I’m leaving for a week/bought a plane ticket to visit family 2 states away, but I didn’t want to spend $1200+ on a new bed). I spent the first 10 minutes questioning myself.... what did I do wrong? Why is she mad at me? Why do I always make things like this? Why am I the way I am? I pondered with thoughts like these for about 10 minutes... and then it hit me... I DID NOTHING!

I am not a bad person for taking a trip to visit family. I’m not the one that makes the relationship awkward. *I’m not crazy!* I didn’t do anything. It’s not my responsibility to take blame for EVERYTHING to try and make sense of Nmoms blaming. I’m not the cause of the maladaptive emotions. 

A weight lifted from me at that moment. I no longer have to continue taking the blame for things that I am not to blame for! I am not in control of others emotions or reactions. 

Does anyone else feel like THEY’RE crazy??? I feel like I’ve been locked in an insane asylum for years only to JUST discover that I’m not crazy and I don’t belong in an asylum.... and I never did!! 

But it’s hard to strip yourself of a title (crazy/overemotional/bad person) that you’ve been associated with for so long.

My mom took photos of me naked. "
124,I've finally snapped and I present you all with the tale of The Filthy Hoarder,Mortuaryfaerie,0,49,81,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536096132.0,9czv3l,"I wrote a really long post detailing the last 4 years of my life that I've spent dealing with this demon but my dang phone crashed while I was writing it. So I'm just going to give a summary and maybe later after work I'll give the details.

To explain her nickname, The Filthy Hoarders house is absolute squaler. Her bathroom floor is rotted out so bad that it's caved in and been replaced by a 2 by 4, there's a pile of rotted food on her table that she keeps  adding to that's probably about 4 ft tall now, 5 foot tall stacks and pils of trash everywhere in her house to the point you have to walk a certain path to go through it, cans full of grease and oil all over the counter, roaches and bugs and all manner of creatures in it.  But she claims my house is disgusting solely because my dog lives inside.

Over the last 4 years she's thrown food on my apartment floor, gone through my medication and belongings, mocked me for being goth, tried for force me to eat pork (I'm Jewish and a pescetarian), belittled me for not having a job immediately upon moving cross country, then tried to force me to quit my job when I got one, mocks me for being infertile, tells me that becoming Christian will cure my infertility,  caused me to have to go to the ER by preventing me from eating for a day and causing my blood sugar to plummet,  would come into my new house and take down things like curtains that I bought and replace them with ratty smelly dirty old ones, leaves trash all over my house, etc.

So yesterday he invited her over for labor day.  It had me so stressed I thought I was having a stroke.  First of all they were supposed to be over by 2 at the latest. When it's 2:45 and they're not there yet I was already sure of the day I was about to have.

They finally show, it's TFH, his nephew B (3 yrs old) and his cousin K (12 years old).  I tell K not to approach my dog yet because my dog is very fearful and shy. TFH immediately pushes K to my dog then flips at me because my dog  growled. I also caught TFH smacking and pushing my dog a few times through the day.  BF was having to hold me back because I genuinely intended to smack the shit out of her for it.  I repeatedly had to correct B because she was letting him run wild, but then she'd tell him not to listen to the ""mean girl"".  At one point I got frustrated because he was standing on my couch with his shoes on (which ended up staining it) and I gently picked him up and removed him from my couch. She FREAKED out and said I was assaulting him. 

So then it came time for food.  We only currently have two chairs at our table so I let her and him have the chairs and told B and K to sit on the floor. TFH then sat on my couch and started eating.  And took her ENTIRE PIECE OF BBQ CHICKEN AND PUT IT ON MY COUCH CUSHION. So I got up and went into the bathroom and told BF I was taking a bath to calm down.  

About a half hour later she comes CHARGING IN TO MY BATHROOM where I'm nude in the tub, and starts lecturing me about how awful I am for about 10 minutes before finally having mercy and getting out of my house"
125,"Be proud, ACONs (and also our younger ones)",fruitydeath,0,4,13,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536110774.0,9d1q24,"This is coming after a trip to the store today. I noticed that my coolant was low yesterday, so I went to the store and picked some up. Now, I had never learned anything about car maintenance, because my father was desperate to keep us dependent on him. I left home at 21, and literally taught myself everything. How to open a checking account. Credit cards. How to drive on the highway. Cooking. I didn't have much opportunity until later to do the car stuff, especially when I first moved out, as I relied on public transportation and the shoe leather express. I have a car now, and I have been looking on YouTube for tutorials on basic maintenance, including how to fix a flat tire, how to check the oil (I live in an apartment, so changing it myself isn't practical right now, but I want to learn), how to check the coolant, etc. 

These may all seem like basic things to normal people, but I posted something about this in an Ask Reddit thread, and a redditor offered some other advice about things I'd want to look into, and then he said ""In case he never told you, I'm proud of you."" A complete stranger on the Internet. And so, when coming home with my coolant, I felt a sense of pride of the things I have accomplished in the last ten years, even with the bumps and mental breakdowns along the way. I had flashbacks to my school days where I had to miss class, and had to inform my teacher, and had to tell him I was missing class because I had to testify against a family member (My father eventually did time, but that's a story for another day). He told me what I needed to do schoolwise, but I could see the look in his eyes that his heart was breaking. Before I left, he said in a broken voice ""Hang in there"".  I remember only responding ""I hope I can"". Well, here I am years later, a nurse, in a loving marriage and relationship, and dedicating my life to making the world a better place for everyone.

&#x200B;

So, my fellow ACONs, and younger CONs (for lack of a better term), be proud of the small steps of independence you are taking. Hang in there and keep on marching on. And know that I, an internet stranger am proud of what you accomplish to get out of this hellhole."
126,Today was a good day! Until Nmom spat poison again.,ThirdDegreeThrowAway,0,2,2,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536083410.0,9cy0ln,"Hi RBN long time no see, 

Sorry I haven't posted anything in awhile, or really partake in the subreddit at all. I've just been lurking and lamenting over everyone's posts. I really appreciate knowing I'm not alone. I love you guys. (I passed my learner's driving test today btw :D). Sorry if it's all over the place haha.

Long story short about a 3 months ago I [17F] attended a poetry event. I met this really awesome guy (that plans the events and performs poetry as well) but I was super shy so of course I could barely make eye contact the rare moments we interacted with each other. But I am sure he was just as nervous as I was. There was obviously a connection between us. (Later on its super confirmed imo.) I give him my number for notifications for the next event and that's about it. I didn't hear from him for the next 3 months. Until Monday.

He messaged me saying that I was invited to the next event. I was so ecstatic when I saw the random number. We spoke a bit and today we met up because I offered to help with organising the event. He gave me some posters and he kept talking to me as if he didn't really want me to leave. He also greeted me with a hug which is really weird, because in my country you don't hug someone you don't really know unless generally you're interested in them. We spoke but I was really on edge because my Nmom was waiting in the car for me and she does. Not. Wait. Also she was complaining about her back so I didn't want her to be in pain.

 I thought it was just a pick up and go sort of thing. I obviously thought he didn't want to give me the time of day so I didn't expect to be there for more than 5 minutes. As one can rather clearly see I don't really think highly of myself. There were other signs that made it apparent he really was genuinely interested me; like his friend making funny remarks about really random things and telling him to talk to me proceeding with him blushing a bit. I ran out after 15 minutes saying it was nice meeting up again And he was really sweet and so kind. He said he looks forward to seeing me on Saturday for the event as I left in a rush. Typical Cinderella story. 

So I start talking to my step dad this evening and I was feeling really optimistic and told him everything. My mom walks in and I mistakenly asked ""Mom do you think he likes me back?"" Then she stopped and said something like I'm nothing like him and he probably can't have a girlfriend, saying I shouldn't get my hopes up and that I'm too strange for him. 

I felt so, defeated? This is the first time in my life I've actually shown a proper interest in someone. I never had crushes and this one hit me like a truck. So for my mom to basically say I'm too abnormal to be loved and to be interested in was, in fact, pretty shitty. I already have such low confidence as it is. I already think I am a pitiful worm, mostly because of my mother's constant berating. I know its pathetic. Now I just don't want to talk to him anymore.  I don't want to do anything. I don't want to disgrace him with my presence. 

What can I do to get this feeling to go away? I need some advice to not take narcissistic comments so personally and to heart. Thanks so much RBN. "
127,My MIL used to be my friend. Now she’s chosen an alcoholic creep over her family and we had to go NC.,SunnyTheGinger,0,26,76,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536083753.0,9cy2ir,"I’ve been lurking on this sub for a long time thinking about how my own MIL is not the greatest, but normally doesn’t even come close in comparison to some of the monsters-in-law I’ve read about here. Over the last year though, she has become a source of immense stress not only for DH and I, but DH’s whole family. And I wasn’t going to make a post on here (because I genuinely think she could be much worse), but I recently went NC with her and I think it warrants a post-if not to satisfy your llamas, then to at least allow me to vent to some internet strangers. Also, sorry about some weird formatting. I’m on mobile. 

My MIL and I used to be really close. She displayed some behavior early on that should have raised some red flags, and we can get to that another time, but nothing seemed too out of the ordinary. We had a pretty normal, friendly relationship for the first 2 of my marriage. Fast forward to this past year and things are completely different. I went NC with her about a month ago and here’s why:

MIL got with this guy about a year ago. I’ll refer to him as MIL’s bf. DH and I disliked him from the start. This guy is a total loser and quite the alcoholic. He’s also downright rude and disrespectful. And creepy. He makes my skin crawl. At first I couldn’t even pinpoint why he made me so uncomfortable. I just got super negative vibes from him. I want to highlight some of the things MIL’s bf has done to give you all a general sense of how awful this guy is:

-He is an alcoholic and would literally rather spend his last dime on beer than food. My GMIL (MIL’s mom) typically has all the family gatherings at her house and banned him from drinking there. So instead, he hides his alcohol in MIL’s truck and goes out to the truck to drink while he’s at GMIL’s house. 

-Speaking of GMIL, he once tried to trip her and claimed it was just a prank. Tripping an elderly woman on purpose is cruel, not just some dumb prank. 

-My SIL’s fiancée (I’ll call her SILf) and I were pregnant at the same time. MIL’s bf always made stupid, creepy jokes about them being lesbians and inquired how one of them was pregnant, like it’s any of his business. My SILf has a nice shiny spine and doesn’t hesitate to tell him  to mind his own business. I guess he took that as an affront and started calling her fat any time he saw her. He never dared call me fat. I think he knows DH would crush him. 

-He and MIL were babysitting my SIL’s children and he told the youngest at the time (baby wasn’t born yet), a 3 yo girl, to go kiss the neighbor boy on the lips. He photographed the whole ordeal and sent the pictures to SILf. SILf was PISSED. 

-Another babysitting story. My SIL and SILf have 4 kids total. MIL and her bf  we’re babysitting the older 3 overnight (again, before the 4th was born). He slept in the same bed as all three kids, in his underwear, and took pictures of himself lying in bed with them. The pictures made me sick. They don’t babysit anymore. 

Those are just some of the main points about him to give you a general idea of what he’s like. He’s also a total mooch, doesn’t have a job or a car, is constantly asking for money that he just spends on beer, and he’s lazy. No one likes him. He’s just a rude, creepy loser and my MIL has gone downhill fast since they got together. And MIL keeps trying to force us to accept him as part of the family! When they got engaged she told DH, “ He is going to be your step father and you need to accept that.” Like, no bitch. He’ll never be part of the family. He’ll just be your dumb, creepy, alcoholic husband. 

And I have a suspicion that he is trying to turn MIL against DH and I because she has had a really shitty attitude towards both of us. For instance, MIL bitches to GMIL about me “being meeaan to heeeerr” and she “just wants her DIL baaaack” and she “doesn’t understaaaand why SunnyTheGinger has chaaaanged.” Like, she for real complained about my son’s name. DS is named after my FIL, and I guess she doesn’t like that. So instead of calling him by his actual name, because it’s sooooo hard for her to say her ex husband’s name, she started calling DS by his initials. I politely told her we’re not giving DS any nicknames and I’d prefer it if she called him by his actual first name. Her response was, “Well [DH] says I can call him by his initials.” I called her out on her lie (because DH and I had literally talked about the issue not even twenty minutes beforehand and I knew he didn’t like it either) and she went and told GMIL I snapped at her and wouldn’t let her give her grandbaby a nickname. Like, bitch. You don’t want to give him a nickname. You just don’t want him to have my FIL’s name! And for the record, she’s seen her graaaandbaaaaby twice since he’s been born. She’s had other opportunities but blew them off to hang out with her bf because DH and I won’t allow him near our son. I don’t even like MIL being near DS because she’s a heavy smoker and refuses to shower or wear smoke-free clothes before seeing him. She says “oh I forgot to bring clean clothes. I’ll just put on my jacket,” which, by the way, is also saturated with cigarette smoke. And then she complains when I won’t let her hold DS. Third-hand smoke is a thing, lady! “But I don’t ever get to seeee hiiiiimm!” Too. Damn. Bad. DS doesn’t even like her. He cries around her. 

When DH showed MIL his shiny spine and told her how shitty she had been since getting together with her bf her response was a curt, cold, “Well I guess I don’t have a son anymore.” She should have been apologizing for her behavior and here she was getting defensive and trying to make DH the bad guy. DH tried to brush it off, but I could tell it hurt him. She still hasn’t apologized. 

There have been other things my MIL has done here and there that have been building up for a long time, and I might talk about them at a later time. For now I’ll stick with the series of incidents that led to me cutting her out of my life. 

I want to preface with the fact that MIL asks for money and favors A LOT. DH and I stopped giving it to her long ago, but the point I’m trying to make is that she needs help from family a lot and she always gets it one way or another, despite her being shitty to everyone. This woman literally never thanks anyone or returns the favor. But DH’s family has always supported her when she needs it because they’re all good people. If MIL didn’t look just like GMIL and GFIL I’d swear she was found abandoned in a ditch somewhere. 

About 2 months ago I got a phone call from SIL to tell me that MIL left her bf after an argument they had ended with him threatening to burn down their home. I thought “yes, finally, maybe she has seen the light and is going to leave this asshole.” And I was actually concerned so I called MIL to make sure she was okay. She explained that he was drunk and yelled at her but never hit her and it was just a one time thing blah blah blah. I gave her some tough love and said, “Look, this is how it starts. He has shown you his true colors and this is the beginning of a long string of violent outbursts that will end with you getting hurt. You have to stay away from him. Any chance of redemption between your bf and DH and I had been lost forever. There’s no coming back from this; please be done.” She responded, “I think I will be done, but part of me wants to give him another chance. He hasn’t done this before. He didn’t know what he was doing and he doesn’t even remember it. But I’d never choose him over my children if that’s what it comes down to.” I told her if she goes back to him she’s literally choosing him over her kids and hung up. They were back together the next day. 

Fast forward a couple weeks and it happens again, go figure. This time must have been worse because their neighbor actually came over to see if my MIL was in danger. GMIL spent $300 to help her move her stuff out and gave MIL her spare bedroom on the condition that MIL had to leave for real this time. I called MIL and got no answer. I guess she didn’t want another dose of my tough love. Oh well. Didn’t really want to talk to her anyway. Two days later MIL said “fuck you” to the whole family and moved back in with her bf. 

I blocked her on everything as soon as I found out. I blocked her number, Facebook, Snapchat, everything. Part of me feels bad because I’ve been in an abusive relationship and I know it’s hard to leave. I try to tell that part of me to STFU. I’m over her drama. I’m over her taking advantage of good people and then screwing them over. I’m tired of her reckless, disrespectful, entitled attitude. I don’t want her near my child. There’s a slim chance I’ll ever talk to her again. DH hasn’t talked to her either, but he’s reluctant to block her because she has some health issues (which she’s lied about in the past, so who even knows if they’re real?) He agrees with me keeping our son away from her though. At this point I’m not going to make DH block her unless she does something bad directly to us or DS. It’s been about 6 weeks and she either hasn’t noticed or doesn’t care that I blocked her on everything. It seems unlikely, but I actually think she might not know because she’d bitch about it to GMIL as soon as she figured it out and so far GMIL hasn’t inquired about it. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I needed to vent. 

Oh! Before I finish this post, I want to add that just a week ago, I found out she has been lying to me for YEARS about something pretty serious. In a nut shell, FIL went to prison for a little while. He fucked up and paid the price for it, but he’s not a bad guy. He’s one of the most genuinely good and honest people I’ve ever met and I’m glad to have him in our lives. MIL lied to me about the reason he went to prison and I’m very angry about it. She made his crime sound so much worse than it actually was. She made some very serious accusations (some of which I knew weren’t true, but I stupidly believed the rest) and I wish she had to pay for that. I want to confront her and tell her I know about her lies, but then I remember keeping NC is more important. The worst part of it is she continues to ask FIL for money. And he gives it to her because his heart is made of gold. I just wish his spine was made of silver. We’ll have to work on that lol"

She has so little awareness of how self-centered she sounds that it’s sort of comical to me at this point. It literally doesn’t occur to her to really even ask what’s going on with me. If I try to bring it up, she blows me off and finds a way to bring the conversation back to what she wants to talk about. 

And it’s not like I can really interrupt her or just get up and leave because she’d interpret that as a slight. I mean, I *could*, but I have trouble establishing boundaries with her and I just want to avoid conflict."
130,Mom Just Called After NC For A Month,LochNesstle,0,10,3,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536087290.0,9cyl4h,"EDIT: I didn't read the Facebook message until just now. She said she had something really important to talk to me about and she'd even come to my work if she had to. She said ""after the talk, you can go to hell if you want."" So clearly this is something outrageous. I'm so done. I'm telling our front desk secretary not to allow my mom in.

 And I'm freaking out internally. She and my dad are on an information diet, and have no idea my SO and I are moving in together. They don't know I have a dog, etc. And after I returned to my desk from my lunch break I see the one missed call and voice mail. A voice mail I'm not going to listen to. And then I see the FB message that says, in a different language, ""LochNesstle you better answer, do not make me come up there and find you.""

My heart won't stop racing. I do not want to speak with her. I am scared. Do I just answer the Facebook message with something along the lines of ""I'm not ready to talk to you yet""? My biggest fear is her showing up at my job and making a scene. Advice please. "

Soon as she sees it
""Oh it looks too stodgy""

""The slice is too big"" (considering id cut it into 12 when the recipe said to cut it into 8)

""I need ____ with this"" considering id just spent 2 hours on my feet without a break, and she just asks for more.

""Its not even cooked properly"" well maybe if youd not given all our baking stuff away id have been able to practice more, plus my slice was fine, she just had the very middle slice and it wasnt /entirely/ perfect.

I was goddamn proud of that cake, ive never made a blueberry cake before and honestly i think it turned out amazing.
I dont usually do this but i actually told her she'd upset me by complaining repeatedly about it before she actually said anything nice at all. She responded by giving vague and forced compliments about it, probably to keep me happy since im moving out so soon.

And yes, she ate it anyway.

132,MIL is the Queen Bee & how come I no longer host DH family for holidays meals,knitgirlpnw,0,42,171,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536108661.0,9d1gt6,"MIL likes to think she's the Queen Bee. She believes she's in charge of all our lives, homes & jobs.  

When we finally got moved into our house, it was the week of Thanksgiving.  DH had handmade all of the kitchen cabinets (he was making the drawer fronts & cabinet doors too which took him another 9 months) so the kitchen had no doors on anything.  We had been hosting a Thanksgiving dinner for orphan friends for 5 years, it always included my 3 dd's (2 were still in high school & college) & lived with dh & I. The year before we included MIL, BIL & 2DN's  (for the first time, found out they were uncomfortable with our friends & my family) as well as our group of friends.  We had about 25 people coming to dinner. MIL showed up, she sees the kitchen without doors, ""I couldn't have people over with my kitchen not finished"" told her, that's ok I can see everything.  I had asked my dd's to set the table (they knew where the good silverware was) MIL wanted to help. Told her no, the girls had it (they had helped unpack things, so they knew where things were). I asked her to either go into the family room & visit with everyone or go sit at the breakfast table & stay out of my way (I don't like people in my kitchen if I need your help, I'll ask. Something my mom did too, no outsiders in my kitchen & I was raised not to enter someone else kitchen without permission, I still don't go in her or BIL kitchen without their ok) I cooked the entire meal on my own. We sit down to dinner, I start hearing from MIL, BIL & DH (I always fix a ham & turkey) ""gee wouldn't a royal crown of lamb taste great"" come to find out the 3 of them don't like ham or turkey.  I was pissed off. 

The next Thanksgiving, MIL calls me 2 weeks before dinner & tells me ""no one in our family likes turkey or ham"" could you get a royal crown of lamb & instead of asking all your kids, sister (who has had a mild stroke & moved in with us) & all your friends, could it be ""just our family"".  I was taken back by her. No, I'm not going to fix lamb, I've already gotten my turkey & ham. So you want me to uninvited my kids & sister {3 of them live here}? No that's not going to happen. Again all thru dinner I hear from the 3 Stooges "" royal crown lamb"" bullshit again. By the end of the dinner, I'm seeing red. I stand up & tell BIL ""if you want that god damn royal crown lamb so fucking bad, you fucking fix it next year"" & stormed off to my sewing/craft room (because I can lock my door ignore everyone) 

And that's why I only have my family over for holiday meals."

134,Intro to Giggles: light Boundary Pusher has stepped up to her first full CBF,Agile_Strawberry,0,9,26,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536079469.0,9cxdvr,"Obligatory on mobile disclaimer. Have posted before, but with a different account. Going to keep this one for all related things, and start diving into the stories.

I was going to originally start with stories of my JNM, but this weekend, my FMIL decided to step up. She's been a boundary pusher previously, but more in the asking if you want a glass of water, you say no, and she brings you one anyways. The harmless kind that you make note of, but it's not worth fighting at all. She's got a bad case of babies rabies, and I'll share a store about shutting that down (which clearly only worked for a while) later. But onto the story. Due to her normal behaviour when boundary pushing, I shall give her the name of Giggles.

Quick background: FH (he doesn't get to be called dear for this story) and I have been together for 8+ years, engaged for 2.5 years. We had some paperwork problems (JNM caused - story for another day), so we haven't been able to do the thing yet, but just got it sorted so can officially start planning. We do want kids, but aren't in any rush. I also have a family history of having a hard time conceiving, and just went through an early miscarriage just over a month ago, on my birthday to boot. So I'm extra sensitive to baby things, and FH knows this… FH is also deep in the FOG.

The scene: we're at JNMIL’s place. I'm on the couch beside her, FH is sitting in a chair across from us and FSFIL (future step father in law) is sitting in his recliner. Convo is small talk things, and I'm more or less a grey rock of answers (also because life is rather quiet, so there really isn't much to say). 

Giggles (leaning over to me): so when do I get grandbabies? (With an accompanying giggle)
Me: You know we want to get married first. (And then I turned back to the main conversation because I am not dealing with this right now. We haven't shared with people about the miscarriage mainly because I don't want Giggles to think we are trying.)

Giggles asks if we've found a venue for our wedding yet. I say that it's really hard to find a venue for a small wedding. Her recommendation? We should get married  where she did, and have our reception at the same place too, and we should also do it in the fall like she did. Y'all, the way she said it, with a giggle, it gave me serious Jocasta vibes.

Of course it's at this time that FH decides to make an announcement. He's been on and off about getting a tattoo for years, and he's back to the on of it. He decides he wants to tell his mom, because her reaction will “be funny”. His sister has many small tattoos, so in theory there should be no reaction.

FH: so mom, I wanted to tell you something… (big dramatic pause). I'm…

Giggles grabs my arm. This is it. I know what she's thinking. I know I just said no, but she's ready. I look at FH, shooting thoughts of “say it and don't play with your mom's emotions"". He doesn't. He done gone and messed up big time.

FH: (he's dragging it out for as long as possible). I'm pregnant.

Giggles doesn't hear the I'm, she just heard pregnant and turns to me. I'm blank faced and simply say absolutely not, while shooting daggers at FH. He catches a dagger and says we aren't. He follows it up with saying he's planning on getting a tattoo, specifically a sleeve. 

Giggles starts getting a little bit of a CBF. She does a “but we're faaaaammillyyyy” type of response that he can't get a tattoo. Giggles turns to me, thinking I will talk him out of it, because I'm supposed to be loyal to her wants, and enforce what she thinks is best for her full grown in his 30s son.

Me: FSIL has many. I have one. If he wants one, he can have one. And I'll probably get more too. 

The CBF increases. Suddenly FSFIL asks a question (I think to move it into a more productive direction), and I start answering it. Giggles is not having it, and starts interrupting. She playfully hits my arm and says I'm supposed to be on her side. I keep answering the question (something about motorbikes and tattoos) so she adds that everyone is against her and it's not fair, in the full whinny voice (we all know the voice). I stop my response just long enough for us all the hear that, and then, before continuing, said “I'm just going to ignore that”. Full CBF. 

She tries again to guilt FH into not wanting a tattoo. FSFIL, just keeping the convo going, asks if FH has ridden his bike a lot this summer. Giggles hates that he has a bike. She thinks I shouldn't let him have a bike. And she thinks that even if he has one, I shouldn't let him ride it. I should guilt him whenever he goes for a ride, because she doesn't want him to. 

FH and I spoke about it all on the way home. He apologized for how he did it, but he's deep in the fog still. The amount of times he said “it's just how she is” was ridiculous. He's been officially warned by me to get her under control, especially about babies, because I will not keep having the same conversation. I have even gone so far as to tell him that her obsession with us having kids makes me not excited to get married, because I know the moment we get married she'll start asking again (she's been asking since before we got engaged, so it's been 3+ years of giving her the same answer). He's been warned as well that if she keeps asking, my default answer will be “why are you so obsessed with us having sex”. The good (?) thing is that this was the push I needed to truly look into pre-marital counseling, because he needs to get on my page about boundaries (he's made a few comments that if me and Giggles have problems, it'll be a problem for him, so I want to sort that out before we do the thing to make sure he understands who's side he needs to be on. I'm not asking him to turn on her, just to be an adult, say no, and back me up or buffer.)

Womb Landlord (WL henceforth because jesus, descriptive or no that moniker is way too long to type a bunch of times) raised me to be her emotional toilet. I had no idea this wasn't how things worked for everyone - I remember reading one of those schlocky Chicken Soup for the Soul books and seeing a story about how this woman's mother was her best friend now that she was an adult and just thinking ""how?"" Because I was seven, and my mother was telling me about how we might not make it home because she only had the pennies in the cupholder for gas.

I turned the heat in the car off, on a very cold night, for which I was completely inappropriately dressed, because I was afraid we wouldn't make it home.

I.

Was.

*Seven.*

It never got better. She told me about how she had to kick my father in the balls for... some reason. When I turned nine, after they'd broken up, I jokingly said I wanted a younger sibling.

Next morning, she told me they'd had sex because of it. And expected me to be grateful. Because I said I wanted a sibling.

I was nine.

We moved to a new place that my grandmother bought when I was eleven.

She kept me up til 4 AM wallpapering.

And then later because she was using my laptop.

Which was mine. Except when she wanted it.

At three AM.

I was eleven.

137,"Ndad's reaction to my illness and injury - seems to imitate, very weird.",ichbindertod,0,5,9,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536097984.0,9d0465,"So I've been saying for over a month that I've done something to my knee. It really hurts and it keeps locking out randomly while I'm walking, at which moments it feels like it's about to bend the wrong way and snap. Today I wore brick red tights and due to the colour/denier you could really see the contours of my legs, and it turns out - eek - the kneecap that's been bothering me is significantly lower than the healthy one, and kind of twisted inwards. To use medical terminology, it looks fucked. 

Anyway, as soon as I noticed it I went and showed my eMum, who was shocked and agreed with me that it looks wrong. She called my nDad over and his response was:

a), 'what, do you have a bad knee do you?' (I have been mentioning this for **weeks**, and had specific conversations with him about it)

b) 'ha you're just like me then, my right calf is killing me today'

c) 'ah never mind' [end of conversation]

d) It is now 10ish hours later and he's LIMPING AROUND THE HOUSE and mentioning his alleged leg pain every five seconds. I was just showing mum a drawing and he came upstairs for no reason other than to clutch his leg, make some loud 'AH, OWWW' noises, and leave the room again. 

This is not a new pattern of behaviour. It doesn't matter what ailments we have in this house, if my dad hears about them he will instantly claim to be suffering from the same or similar symptoms, and he'll complain about them a lot louder than we do. Occasionally he will also blame us for them for good measure, usually picking whatever lifestyle choice of ours he doesn't like as the cause of the illness. This has actually caused me some issues I'm trying to work through where I blame myself for anything wrong with me and don't seek treatment. It's probably the underlying reason I didn't do anything about this knee for over a month. 

Anyone else's nparents react like this to illness or injury? Or if not, how do they act when you're ill?"
138,NDad tried to friend me on Facebook,dollface411,0,3,8,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536093209.0,9czg5u,"Edit: I’m on a mobile. Not sure if the formatting is any good. Sorry 

TL/DR: Never met my real dad, everyone who’s met him says hes an abusive jerk. He tried to friend me on Facebook, then tried to make me feel bad for him, and wanted to build a relationship, when I didnt he called me the daughter of Lucifer. 




So a little back story. I have never personally met my real dad. However I have heard probably everything about him from my siblings who grew up with him, my siblings from his side (and not from my mom) and obviously stories from my mom. I do not take what my mom says to heart, because she has some abusive traits and sometimes I believe she is a narc as well, and because sometimes she embellishes stories. This post is not about her. 
     Anyone that I have talked to about my real dad all say the same thing. He was a lying, manipulative, abusive, psychopath man who will do anything to help himself even if it meant destroying other people. Everyone says that he is also charming, and tries to get on your sweet side. Trying to say that he’s the one getting abused, he’s the one that’s the victim. And then when you show a moment of vulnerability, he destroys you. Financially, mentally and even physically. 
       For awhile I didn’t believe what people said about him. Yeah he was a deadbeat dad who left his kids to starve but surely he couldn’t be that abusive and evil? Right? Well I started trying to fact check everything and cross reference people’s horror stories of him. And yeah it all matched up. So I decided that I was finally okay with not ever meeting my dad and it turning into a wonderful relationship. I put him out of my mind and stopped obsessing over getting a good father, and hoping that everyone was wrong about him.

Well... as my title says, one day I received a friend request from him on Facebook. It weirded me out to no end. I didn’t accept it. I debated accepting and seeing what kind of person he was for myself. I couldn’t decide so I turned to my siblings from his side. They all said block him. But I guess I still kind of was curious what he was like and also super curious as to why he was trying to friend me now, after 20 years of never hearing from him trying to contact me.  So I messaged him (without accepting) and asked simply “why did you send me a friend request?”  Just to see what he’d say. And he didn’t answer til the next day. He said “is there any reason I shouldn’t have?” 

      That made me laugh. I could write a book on all the reasons he shouldn’t. Anyway I kind of laid into him about him never trying to come into my life, he missed his chance, he’s an abusive person, I don’t tolerate abusive people in my life. All that fun stuff. He then tried to tell him my mom left him (if she did, kudos to her) and that he tried to still be a dad but my mom thought it wasn’t best. You know that exact script every dead beat dad has to try to win over their kid. And he’s also saying he never abused anyone and it was my mother that hurt him. (Bull, my brother was like 6 and remembers him beating on her and the smaller kids). 
       I’m getting tired of him trying to twist everything into his favor, so I tell him I have no interest in building a relationship with him, I don’t care about him, I don’t allow abusive people into my life. I’m telling him if he doesn’t see what he did as abuse, that’s on him and he needs to have some self awareness. All the stuff I’ve been wanting to say to him since I realized what kind of person he was. 
  WELL. He did NOT like that one bit! He starts saying that my mother is a wh*re and I’m just like her, that I can’t even stop and think or reason, that I’m just like her. Calls me a total waste of space and air, that he can’t wait til me and my mom dies. Like he  really turned completely around from saying he was the victim and oh poor him to calling my mom every insult in the book and saying he hopes I die. (Real great dad material there). His last message to me before I blocked him was “goodbye daughter of Lucifer and mother of all wh*res.”  (Which really is stupid because he called himself Lucifer).

His last message made it very clear I made the right decision In not wanting a relationship with him. He did get inside my head a little bit and I did feel kind of guilty about not giving him a chance but after reading his last message, the guilt went almost completely away. 
     I’m hoping I did the right thing. I feel like maybe I should’ve given him the benefit of the doubt, but at the same time that would be discrediting all the years my mom and siblings endured abuse from him. Im not sure how I should’ve handled it. "

I just wish she'd hurry up and die. 

I've posted in the comments before,  but this is the first time ive posted directly.

She is an awful woman.  She has been complacent in so much physical and emotional abuse against my self and (5yr old) DS that thing about her makes me physically ill. 

Amongst other things,  some highlights( over a 10 year period): 

On discovering I was pregnancy, she took my passport, back cards and car- keys ( we lived very rurally) so I couldn't get away. 

She used my then 2yr old as a human shield to stop the police pepper spraying her- I got a restraining order against her after that. 

My ex assaulted me quite frequently,  but one night he hit me so hard I fractured my skull,  and burst an ear drum.  She was in the room at the time,  and I remember literally crawling over to where she sat, begging her to help me.  I even clutched the ends of her dressing gown pleading with her . Age paid and batted me away like a fly. 

I wish I could be a good enough person to feel sympathy for her  . I really do.  Ive tried really hard,  and I just wish her dead.  The only reason i wish her to stay alive is so she suffers more .

This is not me.  I don't want to be like this . I have no good memories of her at all,  so I can't even distract myself with them .

What do I do?  Just accept that i'm not who I thought I was? This is the essence of an almost 11 treat intercontinental saga that has cost me so much  monetarily, physically,  emotionally.  
 I can't forgive her.  I just can't,  and I hate part of myself for it. "

Also afraid of retaliation if god forbid someone finds out who I am here.

I grew up criticized, everything I did was bad, or needed improvement,  or lacked initiative (because I didn't do exactly what they wanted how they wanted it without being asked)… never good enough except my grades (couldn't do better than perfect there I guess thankfully, but god damn whenever I got something less than 100+ percent). I remember always criticism, but very little physical contact. I learned that you can hurt and even break others with little more than your voice.

Not to say there wasn't physical contact. Mom once beat me so much with a belt that I had welts all over, all because I was afraid of being hit, so she just kept at it until finally I turned over and she whipped my ass, guess that one was on me. She denies that ever happened though, but certainly it never happened again.

I can't remember but I swear being thrown by the collar once as a child.

I made it through ok… I guess. Had depression, anxiety my whole life. Learned I had ASD recently too, guess I got good at hiding it, or maybe I was just too numb/afraid of making mistakes/isolated for anyone to notice. Parents don't believe the ASD, don't think Ndad even knows. For the depression they say ""happiness is a choice"" and for the anxiety they just want me to be a pothead like they seem to be (least now I know what that damn smell I could smell every week from their room is)

Made it to college, that came with its own challenges unrelated to the parents but nearly just as taxing. Where I finally got diagnosed and treatment started, but it didn't really do much…

Parents' marriage was falling apart long before it even started. Married after I and siblings were born, maybe eleven years before that fell apart.

Ma was being abused, we all were. Not innocent in the reason Ndad was mad at her, but he hurt her.  I stood up for her, got threatened for it. Tried to break my nose once with the threatening. Stood up too many times, got kicked out of the house. Was 19 at the time so I guess I deserved that too.

Been homeless ever since. Stayed at college because I had nowhere else to go, but never took a single class for the two years I was there homeless. Couldn't focus, almost ended it that summer when school was ending.

Everyone in the family now talks like the abuse is gone, but it'll never be gone. I have anger, and impulsivity. I lash out, and I learned how to have a venomous tongue. I'm afraid of it, and I've scared others, my GF included with it. I've hurt animals, and feel like I'm becoming a monster like he was.

I wish I could talk about what's happened after the ""eviction"", but it's too recent and identifiable. I'm limited/no contact with most of my family. Whenever I am around they act like nothing's happened, or they go back to their old ways, or both….

I'm alive because of my extended family. They're getting tired of supporting me though. That's an issue of itself, they say I need to stand on my own two feet, casually ignoring or just not caring about the fact I wasn't allowed to stand at all most of my life, and knocked down hard when I finally started to in college.

I never knew I was abused, everyone tells me that I am. I'm still unsure. Maybe I'm looking for validation as much as I'm looking for next steps. Maybe I just needed to talk to anyone who would listen.

TL:DR I feel like I've been abused but really don't know, I get told I was and there's certainly episodes but I can't see a pattern. Regardless I could use support because it didn't end well."

I’ve just sat here for a few minutes trying to figure out where to start this story. It’s my story. At least part of it. My father has played a huge role in shaping me into who I am. That’s not a positive thing. For most of my life I’ve felt inferior and that I’ve had to hide myself. I’ve just recently been able to admit that I’m a woman, and with that I’ve begun to step away from my past and embrace something new.

For years, I’ve treated my body as a vessel; merely an unfeeling machine that is to be used to barrel through whatever life throws my way. I’ve never mattered, and my self-esteem is on par with this sentiment. I have an incredible pain tolerance, and suppose I am also a masochist as a result. This is my father’s doing.

It goes without saying that he is a narcissist, possibly even a psychopath/sociopath. He is the cruelest person I know, and I’m someone who was taken advantage of by a cult and forced to perform slave labor for a farm operated by sociopaths. My life is marred with memories that tear me down even to this day. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve fully accepted how outside of normal my life has been.

When everyday is filled with shit, the shit becomes background noise.

This post is prompted by events this morning. One of our snakes, of which our house is filled with (among countless other animals; you can say my father is also a bit obsessive, bordering on insane), regurgitated in its water this morning. He cleaned it and while he was doing so, my stepmom got out of his way and used the bathroom. This was obviously the wrong choice. She should have known that he wanted to dump it in the toilet. She’s so stupid /s

He then ordered my stepmom to clean the snakes water, which she did wrong, and put a fan in the room to vent the air, which she also did wrong. Everything everyone ever does is wrong. Except what he does. He’s perfect. Hence, why his slammed doors like a child this morning is perfectly acceptable behavior.

My stepmom and I chatted and vented about him this morning. It reminded me of everything that’s wrong with him, and everything that’s happened. It’s also shown me that, while he has changed in many regards, he’s still the same person. There’s so fucking much, I can’t possibly explain to you the depth of this man’s assholish behavior. But, I’m going to try to show you some of the highlights of his transgressions.

I remember always being afraid of him. There are so many incidents where I would plead to my mom not to tell my dad. Even shit like spilling milk was a serious cause for concern. I don’t remember what sparked this, but I remember being thrown across the room when I was 4. This prompted my mom to call the cops on him, an event that never happened according to him. Yet, I distinctly remember waving to the police officers while sipping my juice box on my bed with an ice pack on my head. I believe he must have left before they came, because nothing ever happened from that. He might not even know the cops were called.

Wetting the bed and peeing my pants was a huge issue. I tried my damndest not to, but a child has accidents. I remember I would get spanked, hard, for every single drop is dribbled in my pants. I usually wouldn’t be able to sit afterwards. Nowadays, as a consenting adult, that is a feeling I aspire to have, which I am very grateful for my dad to instill this desire in me.

The bathtub was likewise a danger zone. Once, I flooded the bathtub swish swashing back and forth, and I was called a ""rooster-inhaler"" (had to change the slur for the sub, apparently) for the rest of the week. There’s a lot of names he called me, most of which are responsible for internalizing homophobia in me, thus making me afraid/feel wrong that I liked men and wanted to be feminine. I can’t imagine how much better my life would be if I could have explored those things without feeling like the wrath of God would be unleashed upon me. 

The most scarring of these names was “retard faggot.” I still get depressed and call myself retarded. He started using that after my mom passed away when I was nine. Although, he used to call me retarded well before then. When I was seven, I wrote “I am a failure” on the back of one of my notebooks, which he turned into “I am a farter.” When I started crying, he just laughed and when I didn’t stop he called me retarded.

When I was ten, a pipe burst in our basement. Naturally, he was furious and wound up taking that anger out on me. He threw me down on our kitchen floor and smashed my head into it. This lasted about a minute, then he stopped. I stared up at his bald head which looked like a cherry tomato, and reached for my glasses which had gotten flung from my face. He smacked me, then smacked my glasses away, saying I didn’t need them. He then smashed my head into the floor some more. 

Afterwards, he told me to get the door for him. I did. He kept getting madder because I kept doing it wrong. I would open the door a second too early or a second too late. After a few of these horrendous fuck-ups, I was back on the floor. Clearly, I deserved this. I continued to help him, but wound up slamming the door once and causing another incident of head trauma. I was pretty much numb at this point, so when he told me to do my homework, I did. I remember having to juggle opening the door for him and doing my homework at the table. I couldn’t hold my pencil straight.

When he told me that this would be the last load, he stayed outside and smoked. I stood there, paralyzed, unsure of what to do. I end up choosing to do my homework, but this resulted in him coming in and asking “who the fuck told me to do my homework?” I was so afraid I was going on the floor again, but he just shook his head in disbelief that I could be that defiant to his rules.

About fifteen minutes later, his girlfriend calls him, and nothing is wrong. He is completely calm and cheery. We go out to dinner not long after, and it’s like nothing ever happened. This charming persona of his that he can turn on and off is a staple of life with him. You never know how he will act or what he will do.

For instance, when his now ex-wife (the woman after his previously mentioned girlfriend; he went through a lot) left for a weekend dart tournament, my not wanting to play chess with him once set off a chain of events where he functionally tortured me. This was a day’s long session of him beating me, throwing me around, calling me names, and more. He destroyed every single thing my mom every made me, because I didn’t deserve them. I was tossed on the floor and told to “lay there like a dog,” where I had a vacuum slammed into my head as he cleaned up his mess.

After this, I was told to sit and come up with an apology for him. It wasn’t good enough and he told me to stand. I stood there for hours, and nothing I said was good enough for him. I wound up passing out while he lectured me about how ungrateful and horrible of a child I was. Even after that, he wasn’t done with me. It just kept going and going.

I got a hug and a little more than an “I’m sorry” from him the next morning, but since then he has not even acknowledged it. Even when I have brought it up the few times I dared to do so, he’s dismissed it with little more than a shrug. It’s self-evident that he cannot even begin to process how much he fucked up. His ego is too precious; too fragile for consciously acknowledging how badly he hurt me.

In his eyes, he’s the model parent. In reality, I feel like another one of his God-damn pets. When I ran track, he would obsess over everything I did. My successes were his successes that he celebrated with me. But, my fuck ups were mine alone, and always involved getting yelled at and forced to work harder. There was one point where I was literally doing three practices a day and was forcing myself to throw up because I would eat too much.

This sentiment carries over to my half-brother. Everything he does right, it’s because of something my father has done. Everything my brother does wrong, it’s because of his mother. He can’t take any responsibility for his failures. Or anything really. There’s so much clutter in this house and the garage, but my step-mom is a hoarder because she has some stuff downstairs, next to all of his shit.

Our house is falling apart, but neither my stepmom nor I dare to do anything to make it better. Those are his projects, and we’ll just fuck them up. But, he never does anything to make the house better. He’s too busy. There’s too much solitaire to play.

That’s all he does when he’s home. After he does any routine with his animals, he’ll sit on the ipad or laptop and dick around. Or go out to smoke. Or just watch TV. Yet, in his mind, he’s carrying the world on his shoulders. He certainly makes it seem that way about his work. He always has stories about how his day was ruined by one of his coworkers messing something up. He would regale us at dinner about how he put so-and-so in his place, or how he put down someone for something trivial. It’s one reason I try to avoid having dinner with him.

When we go out to eat, he will always pick on my step-mom over something. She had her thyroid removed and takes some time to process some things sometimes. But, my father paints the picture that she’s retarded and he is such a better person now because he can tolerate waiting an extra second or two for her to respond.

Talking with him is impossible. There is no talking with him. He will talk to you. Often, down at you. Always with irrelevant tangents that add nothing to anything the conversation is about. He talks to hear himself talk. He talks how he thinks, and he thinks all the time because he is alone. And he is alone because he pushes everyone away from him.

He hates his mother, but they’re identical. Ok, not identical. She’s a racist bigot, but outside of that difference, they are exactly the same. And if I ever mentioned this fact, I guarantee WWIII, IV, and V would break out simultaneously under this roof. He has such bad mommy issues, it’s just sad. 

And there’s no arguing with him. There’s no way to convince him how much of an ass he is. If you fuck up playing Operation, you get a little buzzing noise. If you fuck up trying to tell my dad that maybe his opinion isn’t the absolute word of God, then congratulations! You just won a one-way ticket to him shitting in your soul. And believe me, he will not hesitate to use any trigger or emotional issue you have to manipulate you and put you down.

Every. Single. Thing. I have ever done wrong has been thrown back at me at some point. It might have been an hour after it happened. It might have been the next day. It might have been the next week. It might even sat silently in the back of his head for months or years until one day he sees something you’re doing and regurgitates it out of the blue and blindsides you, making you feel horrible when you otherwise could have been doing great.

That’s a pretty big staple of my life: constantly feeling terrible. I think self esteem is a myth thanks to my father. I was regularly built up to have the rug torn out from under me. His praise became the life-blood I lived for, because I was gas-lit so badly that only his word was representative of the truth.

And his truth pervaded everything. Anything I did online was followed. I was watched like a mouse to a hawk. Everything I did resulted in some comment or him bringing it up in the most awkward or embarrassing moment. No, doctor, I don’t know where the paranoia of my schizophrenia started.

But I’m done. I’m through living like this. I’m done with fear. I’m done feeling like a worthless piece of shit. I’m done feeling weak and unable to do anything. I will not let his negativity ruin me any longer.

Fuck fear. Fuck it harder than I want to be fucked (which is really hard, btw). I may have let it rule my life for so long, but I am stepping away from the nightmare of the past and walking towards my dreams. I forgive my father for everything he’s done, for it does me no good to hold onto a hot coal, but unless he changes, I cannot let him to continue to weigh me down. I am getting out of this house and I am beginning my life afresh, without the taint that has prevented me from radiating my authentic self.

Not sure if anyone remembers me, my other account got deleted but I'm under the same name again. The last time I updated, my head space was pretty dark and it showed in the post so that got deleted, apologies mods. Anyways, some memorable moments with my mother have been her accusing me of masturbating to hearing her have sex, accusing me of trying to seduce a grown man when I was 11, threatening to burn my fingers off as a child if I ever touched a lighter, treating me like absolute trash while I was in the hospital after a suicide attempt, told me in graphic detail how she received oral, would say sexual things that would make me very uncomfortable,  the list goes on.

​

Even through all that though, the thing she does that I can't stand the most is try to control my personal life. She told me my whole life I wasn't allowed to date until an age she chose, any potential boyfriend would need to be vetted and approved by her, not allowed to have sex unless she approved and gave the okay, but only after talking to the guy beforehand, no sexual talk of any kind with any guy ever, no telling anyone I was a virgin, dates are only allowed to be held at the tim hortons 20 minutes from my house, must text her every 10 minutes and update her as the date goes on, ask the guy a list of questions she came up with and report back to her with the answers, no one was allowed in the house. She said if she ever found out I was dating behind her back or had a guy over, no matter my age, she would kick me out. I could maaaaaaaybe understand a mothers concern for her daughter dating if the daughter was say 15 and the ""rules"" were less extreme. But I'm 18 ffs. And it's funny she has the no guest rule but constantly had men over and would loudly have sex with them when I was home, when I was a child.

​

Today she asked me if I was ready to start dating yet, I said no. I got enough on my plate and enough bullshit from her, I do not need the stress of dating and dealing with her extra shit. She went on to again explain to me all her rules. I lost my cool and told her for the 10000th time, I was not following her rules. She's been giving hand jobs since she was in like 6th fucking grade, she's a self proclaimed feminist (more like feminazi) and constantly talks about how sexually liberated she is and yet this is the shit she tries to stick her adult daughter with. I told her she was crazy and a hypocrite, if I want to have sex, I will. It is none of her business. She screamed at me ""I MADE YOUR VAGINA, YOU AREN'T ALLOWED TO USE IT UNTIL I GIVE YOU PERMISSION!"" I kinda just stared at her like did you really say that?

​

Mom- ""YOU ARE MY DAUGHTER, YOU WILL DO AS I SAY.""Me- ""Yeah nah, I'm not your fucking property. I'm done talking about this with you, you're insane.""

Mom- ""WHO ARE YOU EVEN GONNA HAVE SEX WITH! WHO WOULD HAVE SEX WITH YOU??? STOP BEING A BAD GIRL AND DO AS MOMMY SAYS!!! YOU'RE NOT READY, YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING!""

I stopped engaging at that point. She calmed down and tried to tell me ""Mommy just loves you so much honey, I only want you to be safe. A mother knows her daughter and I know you're not ready and I need to make sure you don't regret your decision."" I think she may be bipolar. Half the time she's trying to be her weird version of a loving parent, referring to herself as Mommy and telling me how much she loves me. The other times she's calling me every name under the sun, insulting me, making fun of my appearance, calling me fat, saying she doesn't give a shit if I kill myself, telling me if I weren't her daughter she wouldn't like me.

My silence apparently meant I was lying about not wanting to date and when my girl-friend texted me and I refused to show my mother my phone, she blew up again and was convinced I was talking to a guy.

""OMG YOU'RE TALKING TO A GUY! GIVE ME YOUR PHONE! GIVE ME YOUR PHONE NOW! HOW OLD IS HE? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, STOP BEING A BAD GIRL, YOU BETTER NOT HAVE A PROFILE UP, YOU BETTER NOT BE SEEING ANYONE, YOU BETTER STILL BE A VIRGIN!!!""

​

So yeah, that was my day.

148,“I was just overprotective”,Turbo_Scout13,0,6,40,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536078877.0,9cxac8,"No, you weren’t overprotective you were controlling. 

Get it right, stop trying to justify your behavior. You were a deranged, controlling, bipolar mess of a mother & I, a scrawny 5-6 year old little girl who couldn’t defend herself - got the brunt of your violence and rage through beatings, humiliation, ridicule, intimidation, fear, and mocking. 

Let’s not sugar coat this by saying you were overprotective, you were a controlling, abusive mother. Let’s call it what it is. 

I would not need so much therapy if you were simply “overprotective” I would not hate myself and have to learn to love myself again -  if you were simply “overprotective” I would not have self esteem issues and depression if you were simply overprotective. 

Anyone’s Nparent ever use this word overprotective to try and minimize their abuse? It’s such BS "

Is this the right sub?,Milkshaketurtle79,0,3,3,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536085221.0,9cyafp,"I've posted here on and off. I have a lot of difficulty telling whether or not I belong here. My dad isn't as blatant as a lot of the people described here. In other ways, he fits the definition perfectly.  
He'll tell me to do something I've never done, and yell at me if I don't do it perfectly. He gets off on bossing me around. Even though I'm 19, he's always trying to control how I look, how I do my hair, how I act. He's always got some snide or sarcastic remark about what I'm doing or how I look, but blows up at the smallest criticism.  
I'm trans. He doesn't know it, because he's said he'd disown me ""if"" I were gay or trans. I listened to him go on about how disgusting trans people are.  
We go fishing each summer and stay in a cabin. Instead of changing in the bathroom and wearing pants or even underwear, he sleeps naked and changes out in the open, even when I tell him how uncomfortable it makes me. I know it sounds petty, but it's violating my boundaries.  
He yells at me if I'm using the bathroom when he wants it, even though we have two bathrooms. Until I started locking the door (because he'd yell at me for doing that), he'd always go in and use the bathroom (not just taking a piss either) while I was in the shower. He lies about a lot of small and pointless things if he can take credit for it. For example, I remember learning some fact from tv and telling him, only for him to tell me he told me/that I was trying to take credit for him. He'll do dangerous things and basically insist that they're okay/safe because he's doing it- for example, texting and driving, or burning the garden down to get rid of weeds without putting out the fire.   



But I guess the reason I'm confused is because he's not directly manipulative? Like, at least from what I can remember, he's never done anything like breaking something explicitly so he can blame me. But he's definitely verbally abusive. Whenever he's around, I try to avoid him. And a lot of times, I don't feel safe around him, both because of his recklessness, and his obsession with being this tough, toxically masculine guy with a gun on him 24/7.

151,"I recently went NC with my NMother, and now I feel guilty",Golden_Fleece07,0,6,3,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536149241.0,9d5veh,"This is 3 months ago, and honestly I couldn't be any happier. I never knew there was a life outside the hell I grew up in. But there are those times I feel guilty because I left. My stomach would act up (most esp during anxiety attacks) whenever I think about the way I left things between me and NMom. It was not the most pleasant of goodbyes, she actually kicked me out, hence the NC. It's just that sometimes I remember the times she actually cared for me (idk if its for an ulterior motive) and suddenly I become guilty. 

Do you guys feel this way sometimes too? And should I do something about the guilt?

Thanks for your time. I just have to put this out.

PS. Thanks to this community, I realized that it's not that bad to open up. Thank you guys for making me feel like I'm not the only one going through these."
152,Anyone else fooled into thinking their Nparent was awesome?,AnnieB8764,0,18,32,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536061672.0,9cuv9z,"At this point in my life, I have no doubt that my father is a manipulative and damaging narcissist (in addition to being an alcoholic and possibly a deeply closeted homosexual). And my mom is a complete enabler. My husband and I are in the process of going VLC with both of them. But until about 10 years ago (I'm 44 now), I would have told you they were two of my favorite people on earth.

Looking back, I see that many of the nice things my dad did were for the purpose of keeping up appearances (like making sure I went to a good college and a good graduate school in a field of study that were ultimately completely wrong for me but that he thought would impress people). But I also recall him teaching me solid ethics--which he himself has never adhered to--and being genuinely and appropriately affectionate.

It's hard to reconcile all that with the person I see now, who has gotten more overtly mean and self-centered with age. I also think I was the golden child--my scapegoat brother probably has a very different take on things. I know, looking back, that I toed the line really well for a very long time without realizing that that was what I was being raised to do.

I guess I feel like a complete idiot--I know many narcissists try to maintain an image of the perfect family to the outside world, which my dad completely did, but I fell for it, too. My husband has gradually been helping me see things as they really are--my dad, incidentally, is HORRIBLE to my husband and always has been, in addition to being alternately annoyed with/indifferent to our children, I think because their world does not revolve around him, and because my husband helped open my eyes. My dad only wants to deal with people who are broken or otherwise easily manipulated. 

Does anyone else have a similar experience? In one way, I am grateful for the relatively calm childhood I had, or thought I had--especially after hearing about others' heartbreakingly awful upbringings--but in another way I keep second-guessing myself."
153,Just realizing how deep my issues of being raised by a narcissistic father really are.,krajile,0,1,5,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536115577.0,9d2b6g,"I (39F) have to backtrack a little to start. Between the ages of 25-34 I was in an on-again off-again relationship with a guy who loved me. Or he said he did. And he acted like he did. But sometimes he'd be lying. Or would he be. Things wouldn't make sense, stories didn't add up. I was wrong of course. He loved me. He told me so. He bought me things. He took care of me when I was sick. But then whose number is that? I thought you said you were at X, how did you end up at Y? Why can you never answer my calls? Nothing made sense. He loved me, but his actions (some of them) were saying he didn't care and that he didn't respect me (but sometimes they did). I was so confused.

I'm 39 now. I was raised by a narcissistic father. I first identified his traits when I was in my early 20's and tried my best since then to not let it affect me. I still occasionally fell in his trap where I expected something of a father and was let down. Silly me. 

My mom died 3 years ago. My kind, caring, loving, (submissive) mom. My dad would stay in touch with me weekly; suggest we go for dinner, etc. This was crazy- I wouldn't ever hear from him when my mom was alive. Is he trying to make amends? Has he learned the value of family? Does he realize that he's my only parent and he's not going to let me down? I had high hopes. He was still a narcissist over dinner. Just talked about himself,  his work, etc. He wouldn't ask me how I was, how my new job was, if I was doing ok. I didn't expect it, really, so it was fine. He's alone now so I kinda feel sorry for him too.   
He went on vacation 3 months ago to his home country. A few weeks in he sent some pictures; I responded asking how everything was going, how the weather was, etc. No response. A few more weeks..pictures of a beach....a month later...another beach picture. No words. I stopped replying, aside from a ""nice beach"" once. Eventually he comes back and texts ""if you're free, come over for bbq"". I hadn't talked to my dad in months and he doesn't even start with ""hello"" or, crazier yet, ""how are you?"". 

I was in a bad mood at that moment so I drafted an angry, nasty message which my current bf with loving parents told me was too harsh. Fine, I changed it. I simply said ""Sorry dad, I can't come over. You haven't asked me how I am in 3 months. How do you think that make me feel? It makes me feel like you don't really care and only message me when you're bored."" His response? ""Well I tried sending a few messages but your responses were so short that it didn't really leave me any room to ask you anything"". 

Here's where we finally circle back to the story at the start of my post. I find myself feeling exactly what I felt in that relationship- but he loves me right? He cares. He shows he cares in some ways. But what about when he shows he doesn't care? Which is the truth? How do I know? I 100% do not trust my ability to recognize when somebody does or doesn't care about me. I have no idea what is real. That is the depth of damage caused by narcissistic parents, particularly fathers of daughters. But you all knew that."
154,MIL always has to one-up us,the_taco_belle,0,45,80,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536028331.0,9crne0,"So my amazing husband and I are pregnant!!! This came as a surprise as I only stopped birth control in June and we really didn’t think it would happen so fast, but we’re over the moon! So far we haven’t told anyone except my parents, my sister, and his mom. My angel parents and wonderful (younger) sister had the best reactions and are equally as excited for us, already plan to buy things and are as supportive as we could’ve ever dreamed. I love them so much. DH was in tears by my parents’ reaction and my dad even pulled him aside to tell him how proud he is of DH (career, being a great husband, just being a stand up guy) and how he knows he will be a great father and he’s there if he has any questions. Once again, my family is just incredible. 

Now DH’s dad is not really in the picture and hasn’t been for 20 years (he and MIL divorced when his alcoholism/pill addiction got out of control and he continues to bounce around rehabs, homeless camps, and random rooming houses while still blowing all his money on drugs and alcohol). DH doesn’t really let it bother him as his mom kicked his dad out when he was a young child and they never really had a relationship anyway. 

I have a lot of respect for MIL for raising my husband to be the wonderful man he is, and even though she easily could, she never speaks badly of DH’s father. She was great at our wedding and was definitely the bigger person, is cordial to his dad, and doesn’t cause issues. However, about two years ago she started dating an older man from their church. They’re from the kind of small town USA church where everyone is born into that church, gets married in that church, raises their family in that church, and dies in that church. That’s great and all, but it also breeds some very closed minded viewpoints and general displeasure at anyone who branches out. I don’t like MILBF much because he’s awkward, never makes an effort to talk to us or have a relationship with us, enables MIL’s incessant negativity, and has made some low key racist/homophobic comments. 

Anyway, we told MIL we’re expecting. We hoped she’d be excited, as DH is her only child and thus the only one who will give her grandchildren. She smiled, said “oh that’s exciting” and proceeded to give us a detailed account of her most recent bowel movements (she had an abdominal surgery a few months ago during which BF tried to guilt us into not keeping a bedside vigil for her despite us both working irregular hours at demanding and inflexible jobs). She then moved on to tell us about going to BF’s family reunion and regale us with stories about people we don’t know or care about,  and closed with telling us she and BF went to look at engagement rings and she thinks he will propose soon. 

Don’t get me wrong, BF has been great in the sense that he took a lot of the responsibility off DH since DH is an only and it was just him and his mom for so long. What gets me is 1) really? We’re PREGNANT and you overlook it for stupid stories about the BF? 2) hope they’re not planning a spring wedding because I’m not dragging my pregnant ass across the state or schlepping a newborn to whatever they’re planning, and 3) why must she always one-up is!? I know this is selfish and probably BEC stuff, but I just want to be excited and happy and when we announce to DH’s extended family (who are all very JustYes with the exception of one AIL/UIL) I want them to share in this with us. I know MIL will be busy interjecting about her stupid plans and trying to get everyone to pay attention to her and it just ... it aggravates me. I could see in DH’s expression how sad he was that her reaction sucked, especially since he’s so excited to be a dad, but he didn’t say anything except “she’s excited for us in her own way.” That killed me. I just wish she could let us have happy and exciting news without having to try to outdo it, and this is a pattern for her. (I might post later about when we announced our engagement, when DH graduated from his job training program, my bridal shower, and when DH recently got honored by his job). Ughhhhh. 


Edit: a word"
155,Love Bombing HURTS,flare_of_light,0,20,370,False,raisedbynarcissists,Support,1536066938.0,9cvhxs,"So... my parents have been texting me recently. At first I got all excited because of course I love them and when dad text me to share an annecdote about his life I felt really happy and I missed them both and wanted to feel closer to them. 

But... when they do this, it usually means they either have bad news about someone I love or they've just given my sibling a massive present and they're messaging me to try and either let me know so I'll be hurt or maybe just to assuage their subconscious guilt. 

Anyway, following day I get mega love bombed, fished for information (they're on a pretty severe information diet) and get my spouse casually insulted by mum. Then I find out they've just bought my sibling (who they've been bank rolling at about $60,000 a year to study and not work - she's in her 30's and this is her third different qualification) a holiday to the west coast of America with her best friend because she got good grades. 

So I got proved right. Then I cried because I was right. 

Then I gaslit myself for the next three days that I'm being irrational and somehow this is all something wrong with my perception of the situation and that they're great. Thats still going on. I guess I still just want to be loved so much. Ugh.

Since I went v low contact I stopped getting cystic acne, stomach ulcers, depression & dissociative episodes. So clinging onto my improvement in health as evidence I'm not crazy and I'm doing the right thing by keeping the boundaries and the VLC rock solid. "
156,Introducing ... my GMIL in “Adventures in Caretaking” Long long long,cityvengeance,0,13,75,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536080001.0,9cxh40,"As a preface, I’ve been with my husband for almost three years now. We have one child together, both of us have fairly large families. Everyone is fairly okay, some are better than others. Except for his mothers side, the controlling and incontinent matriarch is his grandmother, who is a total JustNo. She rules from her lift chair, when she isn’t busy asking everybody to live her life for her. 

This woman has pretty much always had it easy. Came from a well-off family, has no idea about money to the point of her having a double-mortgage on a house that shouldn’t have one. She will however only spend money for new items for herself. She gives out weird shit from her hoard that is obviously used or bought from a flea market. (But she expects beautiful new things herself. 🙄) She is a Good Catholic with a penchant for indoctrination. She loves to gossip about anybody and anything. 

GMIL has no concept of appropriate behavior. Upon asking her to please not be naked in front of my husband, even if she is somewhat covered, she promptly burst into tears and told me I was “cruel and strange for thinking the way I do”. “I know where I stand!” She cried out, heaving and whining. We don’t want to fucking see you naked. That’s a pretty adequate request if we are in your home helping you out. 

Which brings me to this. Almost a month ago we were asked to help caretake for her. We lasted almost three weeks. It was me, DH and toddler. I would have to actively ignore my toddler because this horrible woman would tell me her needs are more important than my child’s. She would call me at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 in the morning. All night. “I’m so *lonely*, CV,” she says as I’m running on two hours of sleep. Talking at me even after I requested to be let go from the conversation. So much shit to deal with. The toddler has far better manners than her asshole great-grandma.

Which brings me to why we left. 

One morning I am sitting with Toddler in the couch, watching Pocoyo. I can occasionally hear strains of conversation from GMIL’s room, with all her equally-hideous-inside friends. What I hear next stops me in my tracks as I carefully stand up and set toddler in the baby jail. 

*”I think CV and [husband] are drug addicts. I can tell by the way they are. Did you know she only fed me a piece of toast this morning? And then she had the audacity to go out and smoke a cigarette. The dog hid under the bed from her because she’s so awful. She neglects me and the baby! I try to be so nice to her but she is so sour and mean. I don’t understand why her and [husband] are together. It has to be the drugs. I just don’t see what he sees in her.”* And this went on for almost two and a half hours. All this insulting bullshit about me. She barely knows me, she blatantly made up crap about me. 

Hold the fuck UP. This woman had been praising me all the time (which made me incredibly uncomfortable). Always going on about what a good wife I am and this and that. I knew she was a two-faced narcissistic witch. And that’s when I decided *fuck this I am going home, fuck this 77 year old bully*. After she got off the phone, I knocked on the door after she said “Come in!” all cheerily. 

I walked into her room, stone-faced. I’m a tall woman, with a serious RBF. She looked mildly perturbed. I told her we were going home that day, and I was packing all of our belongings. At first she acted delighted we were going and then immediately got suspicious. We were leaving two days earlier, why? I stared at her, took a breath, and in a low tone I said this:

“I want you to know we are leaving because I can hear *every. Single. Word.* that you said about me and DH. I heard all the nasty lies and everything else. You should be ashamed of yourself. Good luck trying to get anyone else to take care of you.” She sputtered and squeaked out with “well I tell you that you’re a good wife and mother!!”

I stared at her in disbelief and responded with “Just because you say this to my face is not what others are hearing. You called me a drug addict. You called my husband a drug addict. I don’t want to hear from you ever again.”

Then I slammed the door and got all of our shit together. This woman won’t be teaching my child how to act like a two-faced bitch. There are so many more stories about this evil creature but it felt good to beat her at her own game a bit. "
157,No contact to be broken in 6 days,shewantstheJD,0,40,173,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536003623.0,9coios,"DF and I have been no contact with the future in laws for one month and a week now. My stress levels have been down and I’ve actually been able to enjoy our engagement finally. We are so much happier just not dealing with them. 

It seems they’ve noticed and the constant calls, voicemails and messages have begun. We’ve ignored them all. I let DF handle his family and make it a point not to interact. FMIL like to perpetuate the stigma that I’m the “angry black woman” so I tend to hold my tongue. I know I shouldn’t. 

Now my issue is I am heading to in-laws state for FJYSIL bridal shower in 6 days. FMIL and FJNSIL will be there. She’s practically FMIL clone. I’m not sure what to expect at the bridal shower. I plan on just having fun and ignoring them, but I’m worried they’re going to try to corner me and say something. 

A little bit of background: 
FMIL insisted on throwing FJYSIL a bridal shower with her friends and family who weren’t invited to the wedding in Oct. I was invited initially by FMIL, but then uninvited. 

Unbeknownst to her at the time I’m a bridesmaid so I was fucking going anyway. Then FJYSIL told me it wasn’t her real bridal shower. She didn’t even want to go. Plus dealing with FMIL and the faaaamily sounded awful. So we decided that I wouldn’t go and would come to the real bridal shower in September.

FMIL of course lost her mind about how it looks and how dare I not go to “her” bridal shower. I didn’t care. 

If anyone has been in this situation before let me know what to expect. My anxiety is through the roof. I’ll be surrounded by FJYSIL’s family and they know of the crazy so I should be ok, but any guidance is appreciated. Thanks for reading. "
158,Partner fencesitting over in laws poor behaviour,sickofinlawscrap,0,30,45,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536107368.0,9d1b5m,"TL;DR: My partner told me ""I will never choose between you and my parents"", after his parents' disrepect towards me and him came to a head. How on earth do I move past this?

Preface: my partner's parents and controlling demeaning people who treat their adult children like toddlers who can't make their own decisions. It's frustrating to watch my partner be treated like a naughty schoolboy and not the man he is.

Three weeks ago, me and my partner went out for dinner on a Sunday night with his family for his brother's birthday. Over the course of the evening, his brother questioned whether or not I could get another high paying job if I got made redundant, his father started looking up jobs for me to apply to and had to ask me what my job was again (I've had the same job for 2 whole years), and his father and mother started making detailed holiday plans (down to how my partner will access the internet to study?!?!?) for the four of us to go to a wine region, after I explicitly said ""let us know the dates and we'll check"".


The single most demeaning part of the evening was when we discovered we would have to leave earlier than we thought - there was road closures meaning our bus route home was cancelled. We got different bus home, and the bus stopped running quite early (it's a Sunday). We discovered this at the dinner table after we brought up how the road closures were inconvenient. Bear in mind - everyone had finished eating by this point. When we told them we would actually need to leave in about 20 mins the mood soured. His mother told us it was fine, then when we actually left she cold shouldered us and could barely make eye contact as I thanked her for dinner. His father just told us to get an uber home (I don't use uber and he knows this) and then wouldn't talk to us after I declined to use uber. On the way half me partner bemoaned how there was never any pleasing them. It's not like we closed the road on purpose! It was out of our control!!


The next day, I told him how this and the dozens of other incidents like it over the past 5 years really hurt me. I hate being disrespected and their constant condescension and belittling of his and my choices is draining. After that conversation, he had a private telephone conversation with his parents. Whilst he says he defended me in that conversation, the key takeaways were I am too aggressive in conversation, I am too quiet in conversation (🤔🤔🤔), I am too controlling of him and boss him around, and they feel I don't like them. My partner then asked if I could commit to being less aggressive in conversation (I did get on an anti-uber rant at dinner) which I agreed too. He pleaded with me to try hard, and make it work. I said I was willing to try if they are willing to try. He said ok.


Last night, I brought the conversation back up. Upon really thinking about it, I was a bit miffed that I had committed to change a specific behaviour and they had not. I told this to him, that I don't think it's fair I have to change myself to please them and they will not change any specific behaviour, and will in all likelihood continue to be disrepectful. I also told him that I was dreading seeing them this weekend because of this. He was angry I was bringing this back up because it was already settled, said that they will get better, and to not bother coming to his grandfather's birthday this weekend if that's how I really feel. I told him ""why won't you take my side on this?"" And he said he will never choose between me and his family.

I went and had a cry by myself after that, and we haven't spoken since. I'm absolutely shattered, my trust in him to do right by me is gone. What if something more serious came up? Would he still not choose aka choose them? How on earth do I get past this. And advice appreciated. Thanks."
159,Does anybody notice that their narcissist defense mechanisms lead to problems at work?,DrankTooMuchMead,0,5,2,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536112428.0,9d1x9y,"Almost every job site seems to have a narcissist. I've had over 12 jobs since 2001, and most of those have played out like this: I will do my best to be nice to everyone, someone suddenly decides they don't like me and then tries to manipulate everyone into hating me and getting me fired. I couldn't understand why the terrible luck. And why was it that the nicer I acted, the more I would be screwed?

I really tried to pay attention to myself with a new job. I noticed within the first week, a certain guy on occasion would get into my face (inches away) and start yelling about things wrong with other employees. Not only did I not back off, I would make faces at him each time like, ""what the fuck's your problem, lunatic?"" This is something so unconcious that i never really noticed i did this, in the past. I now realize it wasn't indeed anything I ever said, but my expressions that have been pissing off the local narcissist.  A face that says, ""you can't control me and you're an idiot for trying."" They try to manipulate me emotionally, and their bullets bounce back, making them feel insecure somehow. When this guy couldn't manipulate me, he immediately went to the manager and thought up some bullshit to complain about me. He had only seen me a couple times so he complained about my attendance.

Does anybody have anymore insight into why they are so insecure? I tend to be seen as a threat to a narcissist that must be purged from their little world as fast as possible.

The thing I hate the most about narcissists is the way they manipulate the weak minded. All of these assholes/bitches have their managers *believing* any weird thing they make up and complain about you. Even if the manager is nice otherwise, they tend to look at the narcissist like they are their kid or something."
160,Comptroller and Flu Shots,razsnazz,0,44,215,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536067438.0,9cvkac,"It's been a while since I've posted here. My MIL is the one who, when left alone for 20 min, ""cleaned"" our house, found mail regarding old financial issues, and told me I needed an intervention. I've been living the life of a stay at home mom since the late spring and cooking this bun in my oven. The summer has been interesting with Comptroller and FIL, but mostly BEC and raging pregnancy hormones. This tale from the weekend, however, has me seeing red and I needed a place to vent. It'll get long because I'm too wordy haha.

Bit of background: Hubs considers himself the lost child while BIL (who is single and childfree) is most definitely the Golden Child. So much so, MIL thinks BIL can't do anything without her ""help"" and ""guidance"" and will bend over backwards to make him happy, even when he doesn't want it. BIL is a nice guy and accepts help when he needs it, but she can't let go of the fact that her nearly 40 year old son is capable of being an adult.

It's no secret here that I'm pregnant, YAY! LO2 is due early November. This means lots of newborn fun for the holiday season but also LO2 will be too little for the flu shot. We typically have huge get togethers for the holidays with friends and family (30 people for Christmas last year), so I have been telling everyone they must have their flu shots if they want to come over for any holiday celebration. Otherwise, they will have to wait until after flu season to meet LO2. We have had some pushback. Hubs' friends have made comments about the shot not working, my brother sounded extremely uncomfortable with being mandated to have a shot, and BIL flat out refused. The ILs and my mom are on board with it.


While visiting Comptroller, she asks if LO1 has had the measles shot. Yes, we are up to date on everything. She starts talking about how bad measles are and what she went through when she caught them as a child which leads to shots in general. I felt this was a good time to remind her that BIL is against the flu shot and we won't be able to do Thanksgiving with him.  FIL had said when we first told them that BIL will just have to miss out, his choice. But Comptroller...does not feel the same. Some points she made plus commentary:

This will be the first year in X years FIL is off for Thanksgiving!  (But BIL works and may not even show up the day of. We usually celebrate with him on his day off, we're not doing that this year because of his no flu shot).

I guess we'll just have to have seperate holidays like we did with Aunt and her family (Aunt is manic, super controlling, and demeaning, thanks for comparing me to her. Hubs said that was absolutely not true. They never celebrated holidays, together or seperate, because Aunt was too busy with other things due to her manic phases).

How can Hubs not see BIL for 6 months?! I don't see that happening! (Hubs responded and said *he* can visit BIL, but BIL can't see LO2. We're not cutting him out of our lives, but he is delaying his introduction to our new squish).

(Also, I would like to note that my own brother has been told he is not allowed over for holiday dinners or to meet LO2 if he does not want to get the flu shot. I made sure to mention that it's both brothers whenever she brought it up so she knows we're not unfairly picking on BIL).

I can't remember the rest, but it was basically guilt tripping us for sticking to No Flu Shot = No Holidays. When we got home, Hubs was mad. Said that this is BIL's choice, not ours, and if she wants to pressure someone, it should be him. We had a very rough first month with LO1's health and nearly ended up in ER because we weren't strict with visitors and I refuse to live that again. We agreed we'd like to host Thanksgiving at our house because we both can see MIL making BIL come over against our wishes and his (he would much rather stay home, but guuuuuilt trips galore will make him come). Plus, it would be beneficial with a few weeks old newborn since we'll have a feeding and sleeping set up whereas Comptroller will not. If we can't, then we will just show up for the eating and head back home since we'll have a newborn that really can't be away from the house too long (babies are wonderful excuses to stay home). And if BIL does show, Hubs said we will leave immediately. I'm confident in our plan to handle the situation, I'm just PISSED she is putting us in it and would rather put the health of our newborn over the comfort of BIL or her image of a Faaaaaaamily holiday dinner.

161,How do those of you with limited contact with an Nparent deal with their birthday?,ILikePizzaAndPie2002,0,2,2,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536113152.0,9d20cf,"Sorry if I should be posting this elsewhere. Anyways, my nmom (50F) and I (15F) have a very complicated relationship. She cheated on my dad and left us 2 years ago after years of severe neglect towards me and my siblings. Then she got married without telling us, committed fraud against my dad, and has been sending me series of nasty texts for months now in between not speaking to me for weeks.

Now my sixteenth birthday is in two weeks, and her birthday is 3 days before mine. She wants to get together for a birthday lunch and says she got me a gift. Yeah that’s sweet of her, but I know she uses gifts against people later to guilt trip to her advantage.

My dad says I should probably send her flowers and meet up just to be nice, but I don’t want her more involved in my life. She sets my anxiety off majorly (I wasn’t able to eat anything for 2 weeks without throwing up afterwards when she blew up at me last)

I’ve been taking her attacks for years. She’s always perfect and can do no wrong in her mind. She’d lied and twisted literally every event that happened in the past, and blamed me for the neglect she caused. I’m sick of constantly tip toeing around her and being the *adult* who mends things.

I don’t want her in my life and I know she’ll try to worm her way into my life moreso if I meet up with her.

I guess my question is, would I be a horrible daughter if I just kinda, blow off the lunch offer, and her birthday, and basically ignore her? I feel bad just thinking about it.

Thanks for any advice.

I mean this person manipulates so stealthy that it’s not noticeable till the end. And I’m a firm believer in taking accountability for your actions. So it’s hard to figure out what we’re my actions and what was their influence.

She has tried my whole life to get rid of or limit my contact with strong people. She has convinced my sister that she(my mom) is always right about everything and both my sister and my dad are now making excuses for her behavior. I have completely cut the three of them out of my life. 
I talked to my grandma( dad’s Mom) about it and she said she knows my mom is controlling but didn’t realize how bad it was. It recently obviously got bad because now my mom has convinced my sister to be against me and that once again, everything is my fault when it is not. My grandma backs me 100% and says they are behind me as far as having no contact with the three of them and my kids and husband will not be around it at all. 
Heads up to anyone dealing with emotional abuse. Know the warning signs and know that there is nothing wrong with you and it is not your fault. No more being the scapegoat and I hope no one else settles for being the scapegoat either. You can’t fix crazy. "
164,"Meet Jamie, the MIL who uses teenage-tv-show logic to break us up.",Mucheng,0,23,332,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536090785.0,9cz37h,"Hello! I'm really bad with nicknames on this so I'm just going to call my MIL Jamie.

Yeah, the in-laws are both pretty awful and I don't think it will ever change. I'll start out with backstory: my husband's parents had him as teenagers and were divorced before he could remember, and both parents remarried. His father and his step-mother are the awesome in-laws who live states away. I consider his father's new wife to be my actual mother-in-law, because she actually treats me like someone in the family. His biological mother who he grew up with is the fucking devil, that would be Jamie. Jamie had another kid with step-father-in-law when my husband was 10, so the sister-in-law is now a teenager with quite the mouth on her. Since she was born, my husband was put on a back burner. Jamie would cry and tell my husband that she hated him for looking just like his father. She would manipulate him into not going to see his father even though legally he was supposed to have custody during breaks.

In the beginning of our relationship, she tried her damndest to get us to break up. It was almost teenage-tv-show comical the things she would do. He was 19 when we started dating and they would monitor his texts between the two of us (He wasn't even on their phone plan...they wouldn't let him be on the phone plan since he got a phone, he had to pay for it himself. Even when he was 13, he was paying for his own phone using allowance and money given from grandparents). She would then use the information against us. At one point, she took some of the sexting we had back and forth and video footage of in-home security cameras (more like a spy cam) of me (a consenting adult) giving him (another consenting adult) a blow job. She took the ""proof"" over to my parents house (my father is a preacher/deacon and both my parents are highly religious) so that my father would be pissed and force us to break up. Unannounced to my parents' home. She then asked my parents to make me leave because she ""did not want me to defend myself"". My parents told her she wasn't allowed to come into their house uninvited and then boss their child around, but I was still trying to be on her good terms and excused myself. Despite her efforts of showing the videos and appealing to my father's religious side, he just called her a child, told her that it was obvious they were teenagers when they had my husband and that they would eventually learn to let go once they grew up. He then told them ""I taught my daughter what I wanted to teach her, and she is 18 and makes her own decisions. Think twice before turning me against my daughter. Now if you excuse me, your son and I are going to go see a movie. We have been excited about this for weeks.""

Jamie then invited my parents over one day and my parents just left. They didn't really stay long nor did they tell me the things they said. My mom said that she was basically saying I wasn't good enough for her son (you know, the one she mistreated while he grew up). My parents cut ties with them immediately, saying they made them uncomfortable.

When none of these attempts worked, Jamie kicked her son out to live with his dad. This meant he had to stop going to college (despite him doing well and having full-ride scholarships, he still wasn't able to afford dorm-life without her help) and he had to get away from me. We spent a year apart before we decided I would go live with him over there. She called and told him I was manipulative and abusive, my love was conditional, that it wasn't worth having someone mentally broken who had been in a mental hospital, and that he should wait for someone who actually finished college. He then got mad at her for the first time in his life and said ""you don't get the privilege to even speak her name"". When she figured out that wasn't working, she switched to threatening him with not speaking to him again and taking him off her insurance. He did get scared by this (I don't blame him...she is a horrible woman) and cancelled the whole living together thing.

I later got a call from Jamie's mother who told me she was on my side and that Jamie just doesn't know how to handle losing her son to another woman. She apparently told Jamie to quit bothering us and that if she didn't, she was going to have a one-way ticket to a ruined relationship with her son. After that phone call, things were very quiet. Jamie didn't talk to me, or my parents. She would invite my husband on family vacations and wouldn't get mad when she was denied for having not also inviting me.

And then...we eloped. They weren't present (hardly anyone was, only our witnesses and the officiant). When we told them, she had a fit and said ""we would've paid for the wedding!"" Her reaction when I spoke up and said ""HAHAH! Oh god, what? No, you wouldn't have"" was priceless, and she shut up again.

Now, she lets her daughter mistreat me. She, herself, acts as though tolerates my existence in my husband's life, but she laughs and gives high fives to her daughter when she says things that are particularly vulgar and offensive about me. She flat out encourages her daughter to be an absolute bitch. At one point I was holding hands with my husband while we were all out and sister-in-law purposefully slid in between me and my husband and pushed me away. When my husband got onto her about how pushing is not okay, Jamie got onto *him* about *his* behavior for yelling at her precious daughter (excuse me...your precious daughter just physically assaulted his wife, yeah he will be mad)

I've just stopped going out with them entirely. I tell my husband he can go, but I will not be. Last time I saw her was on mother's day where I didn't say anything and wouldn't let them pay for our meal or have any kind of leverage over us. We dined, paid, and left."

Without knowing anything about his current situation, people immediately assumed that he was a washed-up celebrity who was stuck doing a minimum wage job. This story made me so angry because I would constantly get made fun of by my parents for working at a minimum wage job. They often tell me that I should be making a lot money given that I have a Bachelors degree. Money isn't what motivates me. I want to work in a job that I'm happy with. My nmom would often say to me ""you're miserable"" and ""I feel sorry for you"" because of my job. She doesn't acknowledge my job as a ""real job"" simply because I don't have a big salary.

My parents however, are incredibly suspicious and sort of want me to stay away from all of that, and sort of just focus on studies and hobbies. Their old methods used to consist of asking the biography of the friend and their family, in addition to requesting to meet them, which I wasn't a fan of for obvious reasons, so now, I try to be quiet vague with my descriptions of my friends and escape questions as fast as possible. 

I recently started to get interested in attending sport matches, something which my parents wouldn't really allow me because it takes away from my study time and makes me meet the type of people who'm they do not wish for me to interact with (people that might drink, swear more than usual, etc. but carry much more interesting personalities than people that I meet at school) so in order for me to attend more matches, I would slip in a lie every once in a while in order to get what I desire. The problem is that at times I have sounded dishonest, and now, if I even want to stay at the library for a bit more after school, I would return to ""what's keeping you out late, library? You sound very dishonest, and I refuse to believe you"" at almost every time. 

I once asked my parents how they expect my friendships to be, and they answered with ""just hang out at school, there's no need to hang out after that"" to note further, I can't imagine asking them ever to go to a friend's house, I can't imagine staying out past 7pm, or telling them that a friend of mine has a school average of less than a 9 on a 4-10 scale. My social skills are almost nonexistent due to that, and recently, I have started to notice a trouble in speaking because I do not get many chances to practice speaking and I would have my entire speech systems shut down if I am speaking to more than 3 people at a time or an unknown person.

167,The Mastermind and My Child Puking,DollyLlamasHuman,0,33,247,False,JUSTNOMIL,"Easy, breezy, beautiful Llama girl",1536003129.0,9cog7o,"**Background: The Mastermind is my EXMIL with whom I am VVVVVVLC. I haven't had phone contact with her since April 2016 and the only thing I do is write thank-you notes on my DS's behalf because I'm a good Episcopalian.**

​

Last night, my kiddo started puking during his tube feeding. No big deal (even though I uttered a swear word). I turned the feeding pump off, my mom tossed me a towel when she heard me swear (she happened to be walking by my room), I put kidlet in the shower, stripped anything affected off my bed to throw in the washer, and got my kiddo changed into clean jammies. As I was loading the washer, I realized how thankful I am to not be dealing with my ex and The Mastermind.

​

My ex would go full-on Chicken Little. DS puking was totally equivalent to THE SKY IS FALLING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111 When we were married and not in The Mastermind's house, I would roll my eyes and tell him to strip the kid and bathe him while I cleaned up the puked-on things (sheets, rug, pack n' play, etc). Heck, I had to handle my kiddo having a stomach bug  so many times while my ex was conveniently gone that I got used to dealing with it on my own and my ex was part of the problem instead of part of the solution.

​

When we lived with The Mastermind, she'd join my ex in going Chicken-Little-on-Steroids. She made it into a huge fucking deal about OMG THE LAUNDRY (!!!!!) and WE CAN'T WAKE EXFIL FROM HIS NAP (!!!!!!!!) and DLH CAN'T HANDLE THIS (!!!!!!!). Bitch, please. Turn on the shower, let me rinse the kid off, let me put him in clean clothes and (if it was nighttime), throw me the spare sheets so I can remake the bed. I'll put Shout on whatever he puked on (if it was going to stain) and add some OxyClean to the washer so that nothing stains. This is not the end of the fucking world! It stunned me to see two allegedly functional adults without emetephobia going batshit crazy.

​

Then there were the times when my kiddo puked for behavioral reasons... because autism. She would refuse to let me put him in the shower to clean him up, saying that he didn't deserve a shower because he might enjoy the shower. (Granted, my kid loves water like nothing else, but this is a matter of hygiene. Let me give the monster a shower or let me at least hose him off.) I'd have to clean kiddo off with paper towels and baby wipes (when he clearly needed a shower) while she raged about my parenting and how much work I was making for her. Huh. Who's the one ACTUALLY DOING SHIT here?!?!?!? (Of course, this was always when ex and EXFIL would be gone so nobody but me saw any of this and despite the fact that both of them **\*\*KNEW\*\***  she was a compulsive liar, they believed her account of things instead of mine. Woo.) What would have taken maybe 5-10 minutes to clean up (my dad actually clocked this a few months ago) turned into at least an hour because my kid would be melting down about the sensory feelings of not getting rinsed off and smelling like puke and I'd have to deal with that on top of cleaning him up, cleaning up the items that were soiled, and getting laundry going. And she wondered why I did whatever I could to get the fuck out of her house when my kid was awake!

168,[Advice/Rant] [Long] I had a conversation with my Nmom the other day and I need some advice,ThrownawayHideaway,0,1,1,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536097564.0,9d023i,"Throwaway account for personal reasons

Hi! I've been a lurker on this sub for a while now, but I've never really posted before. However, after a conversation I had on Sunday, I need some advice. Sorry this is so long! It wound up being so by accident!

So, on Sunday I was walking to the park like I normally do, since the (usual) peace and quiet help me with my writing. As I was walking, however, Nmom pulled up next to me in her car (unfortunately we live along the same street), and started bothering me.

Money is almost always a -- if not the -- conversation topic, and this was no exception. Because the title of where I live is under her name, she is the one who confronts me about rent money. It shames me to admit that I am not always on time, mainly because I have trouble holding onto jobs; I live in a very rural area, so the only way to get anywhere is by car, and I don't have one. I have to rely on my friends for rides, and they have their own schedules to keep, and I always feel bad for asking regardless. Like I'm just taking advantage of them and their goodwill. 

Regardless, rent is rent, and it's important to keep up with bills, but when you're not even certain where you're going to get your next meal, such concerns suddenly take a place in the back of your mind. When I pointed this out, she didn't care. Money is money, and she wanted it NOW. This started a back and forth that eventually led to a conversation about jobs, and my inability to hold onto them for long. 

This is where I need advice, both for how I should've handled this and for something I'll bring up in a moment. I pointed out my lack of transportation, and she accused me of not saving up for a car. I pointed out some other financial issues I've been facing lately, but the response was always along the same notes as I've mentioned. 

This deteriorated until one of us brought up the subject of my mental health. I pointed out that much of it stemmed from being raised by her and her manipulative, selfish, money-hungry rear for 22 years, leaving me an anxious mess who can't even make a phone call without freaking out. She first told me that I shouldn't get angry over stuff that happened ""a long time ago,"" and that I didn't remember any of it anyway, and that I was ""making it all up to be angry with her.""

This is also where I need advice. I think about what she's done a lot over the years, things I haven't gotten over, to call her out on. And yet, now that the moment had arrived, my mind just...blanked. I couldn't recall anything right away that I could call her out on, even though I could write them down now, such as:

--Spending two hours on a lecture about how evil I was for being an atheist, and how I was going to be all alone when I died for not getting along with the ""family""
--Overdrawing my bank account by $500 with no intention of ever paying it back, then telling me it would ""come off my credit"" as though it were free money
--Forcibly moving in with me last year AFTER THROWING ME OUT and letting my living conditions deteriorate by making a mess and never helping me with the bills, leaving me with so much stress it caused a mental breakdown that cost me a pretty decent job
--Accusing me of sleeping with my ex-girlfriend (I wasn't, I stayed at a friend's place one night just so I wouldn't have to deal with her) and saying she ""knew"" because ""an angel told her.""

And that's right off the top of my head. And yet I couldn't recall any of that, couldn't list any of the reasons to her for why I never speak to her anymore, leaving her feeling vindicated as she drove away. It almost killed my motivation to write (but not completely, thankfully. I went to the park and went on to crank out ten pages' worth of lore and story info and character backstories for my own superhero universe! That's more than I've done at once in almost a year! Hooray!)

But anyway, that's what I need advice on. How could I have handled this better (as I obviously should have)? I feel as though I got too defensive here, and part of me can't help but wonder if I really am just trying to be angry at her.

My person is naturally loud and rambunctious, he gets loud - as one does - when enjoying himself, chatting to friends or watching a game. 


And me? Whenever he gets loud I'm terrified or I snap and yell too. Loud voices, raised inflections from someone I love, terrify me to the core. Because when I was growing up, someone getting loud means BAD. Bad things will happen and usually they downpour on me, the scapegoat of the year. Someone getting loud means my good day is about to turn sour, means I need to run interference and I need to do it fast, or... Or else. I don't think I'm so much afraid of the loudness as I am of its implications, because it's been programmed into me to fear the ""or else"".


And loud voices are my air raid sirens for those ""or else"". I'm not dumb by any means, but I can't seem to reprogram myself that loud sometimes just means someone's totally immersed in enjoying what they're doing.

Just... a LOT. I thought I was a lot and used to apologize for it, but this woman is The Most TM, and I don't know where to start.

I am not joking when I say this woman thinks becoming my MIL means she is on the same authority/ emotional/ relationship level as my own mother. Like, she seriously believes I should love her like my own mother immediately and honestly and often INSTEAD of treating my own mom that way.  


This woman literally cried because I didn't give her jobs in the wedding planning that are traditionally given to the Mother of the Bride... because I gave them to my own mother, the MOTHER OF THE BRIDE. She threw an absolute hissy because she felt like she was being excluded from the planning and she had been sooooo involved in her own daughters weddings, so why was she not being incluuuuuded.  We're talking she wants to make my bouquet, sew and fit my veil (which is a family heirloom from... you guessed it, my ACTUAL MOTHERS FAMILY), be in the room when I put on the dress...  I literally have to remind her every time we speak that the things she's mad she wasnt assigned were assigned to MY ACTUAL MOTHER. 

This isnt new, but it's becoming very clear that it's not just jealousy, but actual entitlement to my ""daughter"" behaviors (how do you even DESCRIBE this phenomena).

She lives about 1 1/2 hours from my family, so partner and I usually separate and spend our holidays separately, and just visit the other's family around that time but not ON the holiday. This I N F U R I A T E S her. Best example is when I spent MY OWN BIRTHDAY with my !!!TWIN SISTER!!! and she yelled about how selfish for not coming to see her family on my birthday-- all of this in spite of the fact that her family \*does not celebrate birthdays\*.

She also asks me really quite personal questions about things only my mother and partner need to know regarding my PTSD and gets so offended when I refuse to answer her. She whines that she's just trying to support me, but I do not need her to support me in that way? That is actually what my mother and partner are doing, and -they are doing it fine?- She hates that my mother supports me in a way very different from her own (selfish and domineering) style, and tells me that she could help me more than my own mother because she wouldn't ""coddle"" me.

Really, I'm sorry for all the weird emphasis, but I feel like I'm in some alternate universe where the rules are all different. I just don't know what is happening. 

This is the level of this woman. Meanwhile, as she is literally expecting me to respect, obey, and love her like/instead of my own mother, she actually really doesn't like me??? I have PTSD and Bipolar Disorder, and she's literally called me childish for having flashbacks/crying episodes, won't allow me to bring my service animal around her, and constantly tells my partner that they should leave me if I ""become too much"". FMIL doesnt like my job, doesn't like my appearance, hates that I'm not religious, doesn't like my personality, and HATES that I'm pretty forward about what I need from my family/partner regarding my PTSD. AND YET?????  


TLDR; FMIL hates me, bit is also WEIRDLY obsessed with me, and it is MAKING ME BONKERS"
174,Need perspective help,electricbenefit,0,1,1,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536155610.0,9d6r2x,"Last week i packed my bags and left my Nmom's home. I told her that it was for a trip and I'd be back on time for when she leaves on a business trip and needs me to look after our cat and dog but I only said it so that she wouldn't stop me from going. I know it's wrong to lie but I just couldn't take the daily grinding down of her behaviour on me and I was on the verge of completely breaking. I need to tell her I'm not coming back but I'm so scared and I feel so guilty for hurting her. When i look at her I still see that hurt child who went through so many terrible things and the glimpses of who she really is I get from time to time but they're so shrouded by the N behaviour. I feel like I'm going crazy, my memory is so foggy but i know she beat me and let her husbands hit me and could only offer me a very unstable home growing up. I know she has made comments about how i make her want to kill herself and threatened to drive us both off a cliff while we were in the car and told me things like that no one will be able to love me as I am but she would never admit to that and if she did she would say (and my last step dad too) that I pushed their buttons and pushed them too far when I was growing up and was a rebellious child to them so I deserved it and that i didnt even get mistreated that bad compared to how my grandma treated my mom so I should be thankful. She'll say that she has always been there for me and that  she has gone above and beyond to support me but that it's never enough (ironically she also says that nothing i do in life will ever be good enough). In her mind she went to therapy for some sessions last year and now everything is fine and she's changed. I still feel so bad for leaving her, Im her only child and it was just her and me and I think that only a supply for an N can understand the withdrawals you feel when you try to seperate especially when you were trained from childhood to be their rock and supply. The pain she will feel will be so sharp and she wont understand why Im doing this and I can never explain it to her because she denies the past and I cannot stop crying feeling her pain because I don't want anyone to ever have to feel that but I cant sacrifice my life for her either. "
175,My life is a lie.,ivyse,0,3,5,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536075833.0,9cwsep,"Nmother is a master manipulator, and has been throughout my whole life. As a kid she conditioned me to be afraid of the outside world, citing kidnappings and murders and awful crimes when I wanted to go play outside or with friends. As I got older, I witnessed my mother physically abusing my younger sister, who was 8-10 at the time. I have a vivid memory of her being slapped across the face and told to go to her room. 

I brought it up last year while in a family therapy session, and to my surprise- she said it never happened. Like, adamantly saying that I was making it up. “Oh I would remember doing that, it would make me so upset if I did!” Coincidentally my dad was on a business trip at the time, and I’m not allowed to talk to my now 13 year old sister about anything. And this happens so much. She even denies really stupid small things. “I didn’t say you were /sick/. I said you were having a /hard time/.” Which is really the dumbest shit because for a long time, I believed that I was fucked up for accusing my loving mom of these atrocities. I had learned that my memory was “less then average” and I had this idea that I wasn’t trustworthy, even to myself. 

She still maintains these principles. The worst part of it is that I crave for her to admit that she’s a liar. My (lovely) therapist keeps telling me that I’m giving my mother power that way, and I know he’s right. It’s just my perception is so fucked up that I have a hard time believing anything unless my mom says it’s true. "
176,So I think Mother has been lying to us for a long time...but how can I tell? [Registered Carer],turbochickenkiev,0,15,6,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536154173.0,9d6joy,"Hi, all! As usual, here's the brief intro of extreme tiresomeness (it's even boring me now lol!) I'm a 48F, who was widowed 5 years ago, with a variety of health problems which mean I can't work just now. My Mum (who is 71 with her own health problems) has decided off her own bat that she's my ""registered carer"", in spite of not doing much actual physical caring, as such, and is very controlling. If you feel like it, a glance at my post history should fill you in a bit more!

Well, hopefully this is going to be quite brief, but Mum said something really odd the last time I saw her. She's said it before, but I'm not sure if it could be true, so I'd be interested if anyone else has an opinion!

My parents divorced in 1980 - a long time ago, to be sure, and yes, I know a lot of water has passed under the bridge since then! Mum has often slagged my father off, but my father has never had a bad word to say about my Mother, so make of that what you will. Well, during a conversation a couple of weeks ago, Mum told me that she & my father (who I have been forced to call Daddy X but hey-ho) came to an agreement about maintenance with which they were both happy, but Mum's solicitor, without her knowledge or permission, wrote to my father demanding more money. This apparently made ""Daddy X"" (ugh) really angry but it wasn't my Mother's fault! How likely is this? Would a solicitor do something like that without a client knowing? I thought they didn't make a move without charging you the earth for it!

She also told me, in the same convo, that she and my father were going to have joint custody of myself and my brother but that at the last minute he sent a message to the court saying that he didn't want to know & that Mum could have full custody. Apparently this demonstrates how little my dad cared...is it even true, though?!

Mum has also said that my Dad was being unfaithful to her - my brother confronted him on it & he categorically denied it. I guess we'll never know for sure.

I guess this is a sterling example of how not to conduct a divorce unless you want confused and alienated kids...

My step-mother, on the other hand, now tells me that my Mum was forever phoning up and demanding more money. Who do I believe? Also, when they split, we went to live in a house (together with my step-dad who appeared on the scene pretty much immediately) which mum said was bought for her by her Dad, my Grandad - I saw no reason to disbelieve it at the time! But my step-mum now tells me that my father bought that house for Mum & the kids to live in! He was apparently really annoyed that mum moved her new lover in as well, and was demanding that we call him ""Dad"". I have no idea what is true, or not! What a shit-show! And does it really matter, as it all took place so many years ago? The thing is, I've been trying to get a handle on how far I can trust my Mum. Has she been lying all this time? And if so, what else has she lied about? I guess this sounds rather paranoid. Any advice would be most gratefully received!"
177,My mom is threatening to show up to my school every day unless I go to lunch with her,gay-ghost,0,22,38,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536098722.0,9d07rd,"Hi r/raisedbynarcissists ! I’m a long-time lurker, first time poster. I’m 17, moved out of my mom’s house about five months ago, and have been living with my dad. I left really suddenly because I was afraid of things escalating to physical violence, and I haven’t been in contact with her since (except for once, when she claimed I was making everything up, and told me I was even lying about being scared of her) . Until today, when she showed up at my school on the first day of the new school year, and demanded we go somewhere to talk.

I said no, to which she replied that she’d keep coming to my school every day during lunch and sitting next to me the whole time. Apparently she wants us to go out to lunch together once a week so she can show me pictures of from my childhood and talk about what I was like as a kid, covering a year each time we meet. I don’t know why she wants to do this, but the last thing I want is to be alone with her, even if it’s just in a car. I’d also strongly prefer she not show up at my school for an hour every day, though. I can’t do anything legally, because my parents still technically have shared custody, and my dad doesn’t want any sort of legal battle. She’s also charming, so the school staff doesn’t have a problem with her being there, and they don’t know what she’s saying to me most of the time as she talks to me in a second language we both speak. Unfortunately, my school is also pretty small, so physically hiding would be hard.

Is there something I could do to make her get bored/just wear herself out and leave? If not, what’s my best bet as to dealing with this?

UPDATE: I talked to my principal and he said he’d prefer the school not get too involved in family stuff and it’s not *illegal* for my mom to be here, but that it isn’t appropriate and he’ll try and talk to her about it, so we’ll see how this goes"
178,Getting your own child's name wrong,Slug_Queen_Tsunade,0,9,25,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536114449.0,9d267q,My mother and I have never been close she's always been more interested in drugs and boyfriends than me. My grandparents raised me. My father wasn't in the picture & I spent about half the week or more with my grandparents. When I was at home with my mother I was the target when she was coming down off something. She didn't cook or clean I did. I woke the other kids for school made sure they got baths and ate when we were home. Some of her favorite punishments included locking me in the basement and not allowing me to go to the bathroom. Sometimes I'd be forced to not take a shower and wear the same clothes to school. Once a school friend came over and didn't finish a glass of ice tea I woke up to it being dumped on me and the glass thrown at me after. Christmas presents we're always clothes in her size or books she wanted. She loved making me clean just to destroy what I cleaned like making me fold the same pile of blankets after she kicked it over and over. I have food allergies that cause me to get migraines and she'd purposely serve me my trigger food and tell me to eat it or starve. As an adult she tried to hit and choke me but I finally stood up for myself and hit her back for the first time ever. We didn't see each other for a long time.after that but once I was married with children she came back into my life she is actually a much better grandmother than mother. Shes mostly mellowed twards me but once in a while she can get pretty nasty with me. I have never stopped wondering why she doesn't like me but has a great relationship with my younger brother. Every single time I think things are going well she does something to show me that I'm just not that important to her. My grandmother just recently passed away and my mother has my name wrong not just spelled wrong but the wrong name completely in the obituary. I'm so hurt by this! My grandparent's and I are/were so close. She told me I'm being petty and I don't know maybe I am but I feel like this shows me exactly where I stand with her. I feel like is the last straw for me and wish to be done speaking to her. Who gets their child's name wrong ? It's not like she is grieving so hard she can't function she's doing fine with my grandmother's death. They were also not very close. I don't know where I'm going with this except to rant I guess. 
179,JNM: Abandoning Puppies as a Hobby edition,byacolate,0,10,84,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536061014.0,9cusrc,"TW: Animal neglect

&#x200B;

To round out the trifecta of living beings rottenly treated by my JNM, we move on now to: Household Pets.

&#x200B;

A little background: Growing up, we had several animals. Not in the animal hoarder capacity - no, we staggered our pets. Over a period of 18 years we kept approximately eight pets, and none of them remained in our home for longer than two years, and even that was a stretch. You see, my mother LIKED pets; just not the responsibility of them. She didn’t like that she had to pay for food. Or clean up after them (fur, poop, or pee - how fortunate that she’d given birth to human pooper scoopers). Or treat them for ailments. Or exercise them. Or keep them contained.

&#x200B;

The notion that someone could grow up with a pet into adulthood was a myth to me. Surely pets only lasted as long as your mother was entertained by them! People having deep long bonds with animals was some real *Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover’s Soul* propaganda.

&#x200B;

There is a particular breed of dog that my mother has always loved (chow-chows. They're wonderful, majestic creatures, so it's understandable). She had one when I was born that she never got over (but strangely did not keep) and when I was about 16, she decided it was time to adopt one again. Well, the puppy was perfect in every way, and just a month or so after, we go back to the breeder (yes, I know) and adopt another. 

&#x200B;

(Allow me a moment of BEC: This second puppy bonds with me immediately. Even sleeps with me like all those lucky kids in the picture shows. So it should come as no surprise to anyone that he is the one ousted a short few months later when mother dear is tired of having two big dogs around.) 

&#x200B;

We keep this large, wonderful dog for about half a year when JNM decides one day: “We should get a tiny dog for BB so he can learn responsibility.”

&#x200B;

So she seeks out another breeder (yes, I *know*) and we bring home a tiny white puppy. Very energetic. Very sweet. Really loves people.

&#x200B;

Fast forward a year and a half. Now she was **too** energetic, **too** sweet, and loved people **too** much.

&#x200B;

This takes place about half a year before I make the decision to go NC. I had been abroad for three months for work, and returned home for a week-long visit. (My very charming mother was crowing on the drive back from the airport about how she’d told eeeveryone at work that her daughter was coming home and so she had to get the house cleaned up - and then she simply hadn’t done it! She’d spent the day doing other things! Just didn’t do a damn thing with the house! Can you believe one person can be SO quirky and yet SO classy all at once?)

&#x200B;

It’s nighttime. We get in the house, and everything is a mess. Shed dog hair all over the floor, the furniture, everything. The dogs are very happy to see me, especially little sweet Lizzie. It becomes clear very quickly that I am the only one still charmed by her.

&#x200B;

She is *starved* for affection. At best everyone ignores her, and at worst they shove her away and shout at her. So I make a point to give her some affection. 

&#x200B;

And that’s when I notice the fleas. 

&#x200B;

And the ticks, some as big as my pinkie nail, so they've clearly been there a while. 

&#x200B;

They are *all* over her tiny body. When I confront my JNM about this, she breezily answers something to the effect of “oh, that’s probably because she hasn’t been bathed since you left”. 

&#x200B;

I was the last to bathe this dog, who spends several hours a day outdoors, over three months ago. 

&#x200B;

I’d been awake for over 24 hours, traveled over the ocean, been through multiple long connecting flights, but I knew that if I didn’t do something, Lizzie was going to spend another night as a feast for parasites. So I corral her into the tub - something she’s always been terrified of - and spend my first night back home carefully pulling ticks and fleas out of a screaming dog. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward a year or so. I was close with my mother’s then-boyfriend (the only decent man she’s ever been with), even after I went NC with her. He was from the country that I’d moved to to work in, and visited often, and so we saw each other frequently enough. When they’d broken up (he had a spine and used it, and she hated that), it took her quite some time to move out of his house. Since he traveled back and forth between his home country and mine, he was not present the day she finally left with my brothers. 

&#x200B;

When he returned from his business trip back to his home about a week later, the house was not empty.

&#x200B;

He found both dogs barricaded into his office room with two giant bowls of old dog food, and a week’s worth of poop and pee all over the floor. Yes, my mother had decided that there was one very simple way to both punish her ex and unburden herself of the responsibility of animal care with no effort whatsoever on her part. Who cares how it might affect the animals’ well-being? Who cares if something might have happened to her ex that delayed his return and left them starving, living in their own shit? Certainly not her!

&#x200B;

(TW: Animal death. I just remembered something as I was writing all of this up. Decent Boyfriend had had a dog from the time I met him to the day I left. He’d had her since she was a puppy ((and her sister as well, who had died years previously and whose ashes were kept in a very nice urn on the mantelpiece)). She was elderly, had trouble walking too long or quickly. Several months after I left, my mother in her classic slovenly fashion just let her wander outside because she couldn’t be assed to walk her. Decent Boyfriend gets a call from JNM to tell him that his very beloved elderly dog had been hit by a car. She died alone on the road, probably in a lot of pain given the nature of her wounds. The way she delivered this news to him was incredibly callous.

&#x200B;

Now what I’m about to say is all entirely speculation: while my mother is cruel in many ways, she has never been given to PHYSICALLY harming a creature apart from the occasional spanking. But I always found it odd that this could happen on a very straight, flat road in the middle of nowhere, where there is no visual cover around to hide an animal, nor could the dog physically “dart out” anywhere and surprise a driver. It was a two lane country road with a moderate speed limit - maybe 45-50 - that was never very busy, and she was a slow walking dog. For anyone to hit her - especially to the degree of the wounds they inflicted -  they would have had to had their eyes off of the road driving really fast for a very long time…..or it was intentional.)

&#x200B;

I want to leave you with a happy note. When Decent Boyfriend met with me after this fiasco, I was devastated and furious. He’d been able to rehome little Lizzie, but it was not so simple with the bigger dog. She was put into the local animal shelter, which was a kill shelter. I spent a long time looking over the shelter for her, and I was terrified when I couldn’t find her listed anywhere. I was afraid that they’d put her down since chow-chows are one of the “scary” breeds, and at the time were one of the top five breeds statistically likely to get put down first. 

&#x200B;

After emailing the director, I learned that she herself personally rehomed the big girl with a friend of hers who were enthusiasts of the same breed of dog, and had plenty of space to run on a giant farm. 

&#x200B;

Lizzie was rehomed with a retired couple who had another small dog, so she could finally get all the attention she deserved. 

&#x200B;

They’re both in the best places they could be, and completely out of my mother’s hands. 

&#x200B;

Little snotty PS from yours truly: Last year I finally got to know my mother’s only sibling, her sister, who she’s always hated. My aunt is very similar to my mother, but my mother is the dark mirror Just No to my aunt's Just Yes in many ways (including but not limited to their treatment of their gay daughters). Being with her was like stepping into an alternate dimension where my mother wasn’t a garbage fire in human clothes. One thing my aunt is well known for is her love of dogs. She has very, very many of them that she takes care of exceptionally well, and she keeps them for life. Their mother, my grandmother, never keeps multiple dogs, but she has a lifetime history of taking in one dog as a very close companion and spoiling it for its entire life. Spending time around these two women from my JNM’s past who are very successful at treating animals well makes my mother look even more incompetent and pathetic by comparison. If the shoe fits!"
180,The Weekend From Hell: in which I realize it’s neverending,dyingdill,0,38,138,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536082345.0,9cxuit,"For background: my SO’s mother and I got stuck alone together for an entire weekend. She brought an endless deluge of awful stuff to decorate SO’s new place, threw out some of my belongings, and has already brought up the prospect of her future grandbabies. By this point in the weekend, i have a constant eye twitch and might just go camp in the middle of the woods instead of staying another night with this woman. 

Anyway, it was blessedly finally Sunday. SO left with his brother at 5 am so he could be home as early as possible and save me. I was calling him every five minutes for updates, and his mom knew he’d be back by four- then she could leave and go the fuck home!!! She needed something from the store before then, and I wanted peace and quiet again, so I lent her my keys. She said she’d get lunch as well. This was at 11, neither of us had breakfast. 30 minutes pass and she hadn’t left yet, and my keys weren’t anywhere I could find them.

I checked up on her, and she was just chilling in the guest room. Cue another monologue when I ask what time she was gonna head to the store, “I’ll be right there I’m just checking my phone just give me five seconds I’m going right now don’t even worry about it Dill” 

Ah, how stupid I am.

I believed her.

Another hour later- but this point it’s almost 1:00 and I’m fucking starving. I hear the shower going though, so I’m pissed but I eat the last snack in the house and figure I’ll ask about where my keys are when she’s dried off.

Finally, at 2:00, I give up and go to grab my keys back and get myself some damn food. There she is- reorganizing SO’s closet, that he arranged exactly how he wanted it before he left on Thursday. 

She sees me and instantly starts another monologue about how she swears she’s going soon she just couldn’t let SO’s closet look such a mess and I need to “keep a better eye on him”. I smile, ignore it, and say “well, I’ve been hungry for several hours now soo I’m going to get food. I don’t want to be starving when SO gets here”

It’s amazing, y’all. Her ass took my keys out of her freaking suitcase and was out of the door in five minutes- she even called me, got my exact order right, and brought the food back in less than 30 minutes. She immediately went back to the store, and was thus gone when SO got home. 

He finally got home, and we agreed she needed to go- the problem is he’s at their mercy at the moment. If he upsets his mom, his dad would stop supporting him- SO would have to stop studying for his big entrance exam, start working full time, and give up his dream of becoming [doctor/lawyer/you get it] because he can’t afford it. 
She gets home, she’s SOOOO excited to see her baaaaaaby and had suuuuuuch a great time with her baaaaaaby’s sweet girlfriend and I quietly gagged in the corner. 

By the time she got back, it was almost sunset. And oh no, she can’t drive in the dark!! Silly her, she’s run out of gas in the middle of the backwoods before and has hopped medians because it’s just too dark- she simply can’t drive at night. She literally GIGGLED and said “oh well, I guess I’ll just stay another night!” SO and I get to unpacking the kitchen together and I just start sobbing. I’ve been on the borderlines of a panic attack all weekend and it’s finally too damn much, she’s constantly talking and in my bubble and making me feel like I’m going insane. I can’t move into my new place for two more days and I just can’t relax with her in the same house as me. SO was really sweet about it and helped me calm down.

Surprise, surprise- SO tries saying we’re busy when I get back from work Monday, she cried and said he was trying to get rid of her. He panics, she stays another night. Rinse and repeat on Tuesday. Isn’t this woman’s husband missing her at this point? It’s been a whole ass week now. Finally, Wednesday during my move-in, she suddenly disappears right when we could use some help carrying boxes! Thus ends her reign of terror- until we can’t find my birth control that night.

It was in the damn bathroom trash can, I’m guessing she thought we’d assume it got lost during the move and idk??? Just risk it??? Smile through the pain when I have an unmedicated period??? 

Regardless, I told SO I would not live with him until we’re self supported and can feel more comfortable in laying down strict boundaries. I also told him that from here on out, I will not be alone with her and will leave wherever we are if she says anything I don’t like. The problem is putting that into practice though- I feel like a limp noodle and get so anxious around domineering people that I’m worried it’s going to take a lot of time and practice. SO and I plan on getting married after I graduate and I don’t want to let this be the rest of my life. 

So, any advice along that vein would be more than welcomed! Also, any nickname suggestions y’all have got... I have more stories I can tell, and I’m sure there’ll be more madness in the long run.

181,An angry letter to nMom (that will never get sent),wittyrutabaga,0,1,2,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536102997.0,9d0rlb,"(CW: alcoholism)

Context:

I'm in my late twenties and I cut off nmom entirely when I was in my early twenties. If you check my post history, you can see a little more of what our dynamic was. Like all nmoms, however, she was terrible.

That is to say, she still is terrible, just very very very far away from me. I haven't spoken to her in years, but occasionally she does little things to try to trick me. Recently, she sent me a YouTube link from a profile that pretended to be someone else. When I opened the video, it was me! A childhood video of myself as a toddler with my sister painting Easter eggs.

I started crying-- being unexpectedly confronted with things like this will do that. I thought, *what a jerk! What a terrible lady. She made a whole fake profile just to make me click this video. For what, emotional blackmail? She's the worst.*

I blocked the profile and I ***am not going to actually say anything to her***, but for the purposes of venting, I've composed a letter which I hope you all don't mind me sharing.

>I see what this is; I see the strategy here. You show me some fond memory we both have of before any of this happened, and I come around to see that I've been unreasonable. It's very transparent, and you've tried it before.  
>  
>First of all, I think it’s pretty telling that your video of choice is so old. I'm barely verbal at this point, and I probably hadn't yet developed the ability to remember events, because let me tell you, ***I do not remember it.*** It’s great that **you** miss the egg decorating, but for all intents and purposes, I may has well have not even been there.  
>  
>The interesting thing about deciding to have children is that you have to go into it knowing that your kids will grow up. That little girl you're reminiscing about was just as real as the grown woman you're harassing, and she spent a lot more time out of that phase than she spent in it.  
>  
>Your memories of raising me are good for you because they all occurred before I developed this “mean streak,” aka **started calling you out on your bulls\*\*\*.** You get to cherry pick the individual 6-minutes of footage from any holiday event where I knew I had to be cheery for the camera and go, ""Ohhhh, WittyRutabaga was so sweet back then! What happened?""  
>  
>OH **MAN**, I wish you had a camera going when I was working a part time job and in community college at the same time, trying to save up for a big move, and you busted into my room screaming at the top of your lungs at 3 o’clock in the morning. I didn't know it at the time, but you were having a psychotic episode, and despite my urging, you never sought therapy because, ""I'm fine, I was just drunk.""  
>  
>I wish you had the camera on when you screamed at me in front of 5 of my friends in high school because a sixth friend had just left without saying, ""Thank you,"" to you. Those five kids said, ""Thank you"" on their way out and *never* came to our house again.  
>

182,Some small things MIL has done,fortheloveofl,0,7,17,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536100007.0,9d0dwt,"Most of these were and still are pretty funny to me. But they're still fucking crazy.

•Peed on the floor because her boyfriend wouldn't let her in the bathroom

•Got a hammer and was going to bust down their bedroom door because her boyfriend locked her out.

•Busted into the bathroom while I was trying to pee with her pants down yelling ""Look at it! Look at it if you think I'm cheating!"" And simply said ""Oh, you aren't boyfriend. Sorry."" When she noticed it was me. Apparently she wanted to show him her perfectly intact vagina as proof she wasn't having sex with other guys.

•Came outside where DW and her ex-bff (is there a subreddit for shitty friend stories? Because oh man there's a lot to unpack with that one.) And drunkenly started teaching them self defense in case a man tried to attack them. She ended the lesson by screaming girl power before going back inside.

•Always trying to tell you what to do and how to live your life. 

•Found her hunkered down on the floor in our room giving our cats extra food even though they were on a diet. She thinks open feeding is best and even tried to say she knew our cats were starving because of how excited they got when she opened the food bag. We were like ""No, they didn't get excited because they're starving. They got excited because they're fat and don't stop eating when we open feed."""
183,Update: The Nose holds me underwater and it is somehow my fault,DryDesertBastard,0,35,292,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1535984463.0,9cluac,"In my last post, I mentioned how my mother, The Nose, held me underwater as a child. I posted a vague bit about it on social media without naming names or making reference to who it was and believed it was Not the Worst Idea and that victims shouldn't have to be silent. Apparently since I've been relocating my stuff and working remotely, The Nose felt it was necessary to stalk my social media because I am a child and need big brother keeping an eye on me.

I got a sobbing call about how:

1. She didn't do it 
2. It happened to her as a kid, why would she do it? 
3. She didn't mean it 

I have been in the process of relocating myself and all my belongings and had many things still over my their house. I did a recon of whatever I could fit in two tiny sedans in the dead of night. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to grab everything (a lot of my things are very fragile because... idiot) and had to return the other day because my very finicky plants I've been growing (these are the same plants I've posted about which the Nose hates) were going to die if I didn't take care of them.

SO convinces me to tell them I'm on my way over to get more shit. I think it's a bad idea, but he's coming with me and being my meat shield, so I agree. My JNDad meets us in the living room and tears into me about making The Nose sad and how she was ""beside herself"" the last few days and how dare I? He can't understand why I dont speak to him and can't understand why I would do this to her. I ask if he ever does any introspection. He flat out says no.

Apparently TN hasn't been so completely beside herself because she tore into my office and sleeping area. She's moved all my belongings (including clothes, underwear etc), supplies, and tools around. The best part of it all? A note. She loves to write notes and leave them gingerly in places so that a dramatic read can be made. 

This note included her writing my post down, word for word, and THEN rewriting it and breaking down every single sentence with her own notes and annotations. I think the note is six pages. I haven't counted. I've only skimmed through it. It's vile. I'm going to leave it up to my future therapist.

What I saw was: her admitting to holding me down. Her asking me how much do I really remember. Calling me a liar. Calling me a sociopath. Saying I'm projecting. Saying she no longer cares about me and finally, I got what I wanted, I am all alone.

Swell.

Talking to someone with a psychology background recently, they mentioned The Nose sounds like she has borderline tendencies. I'll admit... yeah. It does. Its always been black or white, absolute love and adoration or hate. I never could connect to her. Anything and everything was held over my head no matter what age. 

I feel like this isn't it but also it might be. I feel there's a void in my life and I'm afraid to cut my parents out but I have always, always wanted to. I just want to get over this because I'm so tired of being emotionally labored all the time. Ugh.

184,Should I tell my brother about my Ndad’s love child?,happynattyy,0,5,5,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536085428.0,9cybhl,"*UPDATE my dad just sent this text to me & Patrick*:
I had a dream a month ago that your mother killed herself I never told her the dream but I can see that’s what you guys are pushing her to do. It’s fine though. No matter what you guys think of me it’s heartless to have people on her job looking at her in a messed up state because of what you say to her. 
All this because you guys are too proud for us to say anything to? Smh. Please leave her out of this you guys are killing her and I won’t allow it.”

My Ndad verbally, emotionally and mentally tortured my brother (we’ll call him Patrick) and I growing up. A few years ago, while away at college, I found out Ndad had a child with the same woman he was cheating on my Emom with for years. Once I found out, Ndad pulled out all of the stops to get me to forgive him and not tell my brother. Unfortunately, I was stupid enough to believe he changed and kept quiet about it.
However, Patrick is now living with my insane parents again while looking for a stable post undergraduate job, and my Ndad wasted no time getting back to verbally abusing Patrick. I have gone NC with both parents as a result of this (as of 2 weeks ago). 
But the problem is that Patrick is extremely depressed and sees no way out of the abusive cycle, even though I keep telling him that it is imperative for him to get out. I even told him he could move in with me immediately. I think that being honest with Patrick about the secret child, will help to finally push him out of that shithole by illustrating the depths of my parents’ manipulation. But I’m scared of causing him to spiral into an even darker place. 

What should I do? Thank you for your time.

185,I wrote my College Essay a couple years ago about Growing up with a Ndad,itsasher_notasscher,0,1,6,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536091557.0,9cz7e1,"Growing up in a household with my father was hard. Some nights would be calm and I’d fall asleep to the sound of him playing his keyboard, but most nights were full of screaming and crying. I grew up scared to sleep alone at night and used to locking myself in my parents bedroom while my mother cried and my father pounded on the door screaming. Eventually he would give up, go take a walk outside and the next morning he’d act like nothing had happened. I thought that every household was like mine and that every father would wake up their child in the middle of the night to settle a fight between him and his wife. I was used to the constant screaming. The only place I felt safe was when I was at school. I would walk into school and breathe a sigh of relief. I remember when it took a turn for the worst though. I don’t remember exactly what I had done that night specifically to make him mad, but I do remember having a water bottle being thrown at me and the top shattering across the floor. I truly think that was the turning point of his behavior. From that moment on he was out of control. 

Weeks after the water bottle incident, my mom took him to the doctor. I figured it was a routine check-up, maybe an x-ray for the brain tumour he had removed right before I was born. Little did I know, he was being admitted to the hospital, the psychiatric ward. One overnight stay at the doctors turned into days, then weeks. I was scared, I didn’t know where he was. I had to walk into school everyday smiling, pretending there was nothing wrong, when all I could think about was if my dad was okay. I wasn’t allowed to see him, and I remember being too upset to talk to him on the phone. I would give my mother gifts to give to him, little notes telling him to feel better. I didn’t know why he was gone, but I found myself feeling grateful that he was. I felt safe and got used to the calm of him being away. I later learned why he was gone, and what he was diagnosed with; Bipolar Disorder, ADHD, Narcissistic Personality Disorder and Depression. 

He goes in waves still with his illnesses. Sometimes his medicine stops working and he begins to spiral again, I still won’t sleep at his house. Growing up in a toxic house taught me a lot. Everyone sees me as this teenage white privileged girl, who lives in an expensive part of the city and buys starbucks every morning. What they don’t see is what goes on behind closed doors. They don’t see how I used to cry myself to sleep because I was too scared of what would happen to my mother while I was sleeping. Growing up with my dad having mental illnesses showed me how to grow up quickly, I often comforted my crying mother and had to put on a brave face to go to school. I became someone who felt like I was responsible for everyone's safety. I would make my mother sleep with me in my bed so she would be safe. I would usher her into the bedroom and lock the door when I felt him about to lose control. Although I was still just a child, I felt like I had the responsibility of an adult to keep my mother and myself safe from my father’s manic tendencies.

As a young adult, I now know that how I grew up was not a normal situation, that my father couldn’t fully control his actions and that my mother did her best to keep me as safe as she could. Looking back on my childhood, I can see a lot of things I couldn’t when I was living it. It shaped me into who I am today, someone strong and someone who cares tremendously about the people around me. I want to become someone who people feel safe around. As someone who only felt safe at school, I want to become a teacher. I want to be a safe space for children who feel unsafe at home, or feel like they need to pretend like everything's okay, even when it is not."

This takes place before the whole message cheating thing. 

This is the tale of the wedding dress, now to preface me and my dh are not traditional at all he helped me chose my wedding dress on line measure me and send off for it. When pq found out she started going on about tradition how it wasn't right (cry me a river). Dh asked if she paid for it, she replied no he responds with well you don't get a say, (I told you all he is awesome as hell).

Now we had travelled down once again to see them, and things were actually going okay between pq and me, I decided to throw her a bone and showed her my dress, now to me it's gorgeous fitted to the waist then kinda comes out like a skater skirt to just above the knee. She is umm and ahhing over it and actually being generally nice about it.

She then comes out with gem I have a simialr dress in pink I think I will wear it to your wedding, record scratch what, like hell you will. I didn't dear readers say anything in the moment I was shocked. Later on that evening me and dh where talking and I told him what his mum had said, needless to say he wasn't happy he went down stairs and asked me to follow him, he out right asked his mum what was said and the daft bint repeated word for word what she said to me, he played along and was like oh beautiful can I see it, and dear readers I'm ashamed I doubted my dh and was about to kill him, as she scampers off to get the dress he looks at me and says don't worry, at this point I'm still shooting him daggers.

She come down stairs with a dress that isn't like mine guys it was identical and when he looked at the tag it was from the same shop and everything and neon pink! He takes the dress pretending to inspect then looks her straight in the eye and says mum if you so much as entertain the thought of wearing this dress or turning up to my wedding in it you will not be welcome, you will look ridiculous in a neon pink dress the same dress my wife will be wearing, and I will tell everyone you ordered it specially for the wedding to match the bride (her image is her everything) and tell them we told you not to. She splutters out some excuses and says she won't wear it, the subject was left alone after that.

Upon returning home with my dh I'm unpacking and discover the dress my dh didn't fully trust her, so he stashed it so she had no access to it, she never mentioned the dress going missing and never as far as I know brought the subject up again."

191,Abusive parents thinking about your own sake just when it reflects on their reputation,captaiNB_Rolex,0,2,2,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536088278.0,9cyqdp,"Like all or most of you, I grew up in an abusive household.
My parents are divorced, then I live with my mother in a house where my grandmother, grandfather and uncle live upstairs.

*Grandmother* was the dragon: the annoying one nobody stands up against because she knows how to stress you out til you implode; arrogant and judgemental, obsessed by reputation, and also the most relevant figure of my childhood.
Best quote: “Someone like you can only end up being a prostitute or a drug addicted”. Why? Because I sucked at school when I was 12. Y’know, I was depressed thanks to the nice words they used to tell me everyday!

*Mother* was the ghost: there, but not really there. She won’t play with little me and seemed to be very bothered by my presence. She would side my grandmother because faulting me was way easier.
Best quote: “You are no longer my son”. Why? Because I got a reprimand note in third grade.

Other relatives are not relevant.

What triggered the abuse was one thing: school. Both of them were obsessed by school grades and I _had_ to be the top student.

The abuse started when middle school started.
At elementary school I was considered some sort of “””prodigy child”””, they said I had a talent for writing. Maybe that’s why they wanted me to be the best in school so badly.
The summer before the beginning of middle school, I discovered the internet and drowned in it like... completely. So much that, after the first school term of four months, which I perceived as the end of an age and the beginning of a new one, I looked back and realized I didn’t remember a thing about what had happened in real life. I was literally living exclusively in the internet, neglecting anything real.
Then I got worse at school.
Ghost and Dragon didn’t like it.
They would insult me, yell at me and quit talking to me for days. I remember clearly the feeling of uneasiness that was always inside of me, it was heavy on my chest, head and shoulders. I kept having hysterical attacks and I was called “psycho” for them. My whole family was against me and gave me the fault for the hell-like family situation. I would bite the inside of my cheeks to feel some physical pain and every night I wished I wouldn’t wake up the following morning.

At school my teachers noticed I was no longer behaving as myself. They tried to talk to me in private many times, but I couldn’t say a word.
I knew my family was the one making me suffer so much, but I used to think it was my fault since that was what everyone told me; then I knew my mother would have told the teachers that I was the one making things up and that I was bad, and I didn’t want my teachers to dislike me as my family did and as I did myself.

Before the whole of this happened, my mother had already hurt me a lot being a Ghost who gave me the impression of not wanting to be around me, and excluded me from her life. And my grandmother always made me self-conscious about something. She always made me feel wrong. She never wanted me to be myself, she wants the prototype of a perfect grandchild, so that she can show off.

The two of them no longer abuse me as they used to, but often they still are hurtful and I generally get upset around them. Though I act friendly most of the time, but I have difficulties with grandmother.
Sometimes I’m rude and this is bad, I’m trying to change it. This happens because many times I want to tear away my own skin, when I happen to be involved with them in any way.
However, they are still the same people. The only one who has changed is me, that’s why I don’t get abused that much anymore.

I’m afraid to bring it up with my psychiatrist because I fear she’ll tell me I have to get along with my family, and that would destroy me.

However, my grandmother always told me she did it for my own sake. She compliments me when I get good grades, but I never felt happy for her compliments. I’m not sure why. Maybe I never cared to get compliments out of her. She would still tell me: “I love you” and this kind of things, but it just feels sickening. It’s always been like this. I’ve never wanted to hug her or so, I never wanted love from her, never liked her. Never found pleasure in anything she did for me.
Though this confuses me. Here I read stories about Npeople always belittling their children, etc., but my grandmother would actually compliment me when I got the best grades. Only in those situations, but they would. Though my mother also says she is embarrassed of me when I’m bad at school, so much she always tells me she doesn’t want to go to the meetings with professors. I think she has no interest in actually helping me to become good, she wants me to be good without putting any effort into it herself. I really think she wants me to be good at school for a matter of reputation. It’s probably the same with grandmother.

This is mostly a rant, but what do you think?"

193,In-laws just decided to “pop in”...,Darwinian_10,0,56,559,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1535994852.0,9cn9fc,"So, this is happening as we speak. I’ve been lurking on this sub because I’m not married yet, but my DSO and I are technically common law now. His mother is a narcissist and he is the scapegoat. His brother (BIL) and sister (SIL) are both alternating golden children. (When it suits MIL). SIL basically abandoned her son (4yo), and he has been living with MIL and FIL for about 2 1/2 years, but was there a lot before that too, but that’s another story for another day. BIL (28yo) also moved back in with MIL and FIL last year, and he’s a flying monkey. They live an hour away from us. 

Anyway, on to today...DSO and I had made plans as today is a holiday, and the last long weekend of the summer. We were going to go to the beach, go for a bike ride, etc. That is, until MIL and family decided they were coming in for a visit today. DSO said to me: “you know they won’t stay long, they never do.” But he was WRONG. They showed up a couple of hours ago and brought in an uncooked casserole to put in the oven for dinner, so they’re obviously planning on being here for a few hours longer. Great. I’m already finding it hard to be around them without snapping. They brought the 4 year old with them, as well as BIL, so it’s a full house. 4yo is also a menace. He destroys everything, thinks he’s entitled to storm around our house (we don’t have kids yet, so it’s not kid friendly). MIL and FIL don’t do anything about it. 

As we speak, DSO has taken them out of the house to go play at a playground, because I told him that I couldn’t handle them being in my space and inviting themselves over to spend the whole goddamn day. 

About DSO...he is in the process of growing a spine, and MIL resents me because of that. He still has the scapegoat mentality that if he just pleases her, she’ll love him and give him praise. He says he wants to be LC, but then she pulls shit like this. We’re working on it, but it’s been hard. Every time he visits them, he comes home angry because of how much he doesn’t like being around them. 

Anyway, I just needed a place to vent my frustrations about this, and y’all seem really supportive as a community. Sorry if I got any of the acronyms or terms wrong.  :/

I’m actually thinking of putting the casserole in the oven now so that it’s done quicker and they’re outta here faster...

EDIT: I super love all the devious “BURN THE CASSEROLE” posts from
y’all haha. Amazing. However, I didn’t burn it or drop it. I let it cook. She makes terrible food anyhow. SO calls her meals “congealed slop”, because they’re always greasy and covered in cheese. He’s told her on multiple occasions that I’m a better cook than she is, which pleases me to no end. 

They just left. I hope they felt like I was pushing them out the door, because I practically was. I made it clear to SO that this is to NEVER happen again. I have told him how I feel about it. Next time it happens, I am either locking the door, or I’m leaving for the day. 

I hope they felt like I was being cold to them and ignoring them, because they were not welcome. 

Full disclosure: they technically did tell us they were coming in for the day, but it was an hour before they arrived. My SO said yes without checking in with me first, which I told him wasn’t okay. I felt bad though, because he never gets to see his nephew and wanted to spend time with the kid. I felt bad getting angry with my SO for this, because I get to see my niece a lot more often than he does his nephew. I also feel that MIL guilt trips SO about not seeing the kid though, so it’s a complicated situation. :/ "
194,The subtle criticism of The Queen of Bitchlandia,SoVeryTired81,0,70,381,False,JUSTNOMIL,Sucks to suck Bitch!,1536043949.0,9ct7ri,"This is of course all in the past. Reflecting on the Queen lately has seen me realising that the Queen didn't approve of my parenting like ever. Like I knew there was some but it was just about everything. 

1. I swear around my kids. I always have, I taught them that there are kid words and grown up words and they shouldn't use grown up words. Now that they're older I ask that they not swear around adults out of respect. Swear with your friends all you want. If you get into trouble at school for swearing I'm going to let them punish you in an appropriate manner. 

The Queen HATED this. She frequently said ""if there's one thing I regret about raising you all its that I swore around you so much."" 

2. I do minimal policing of television. I don't let them watch Gore, I don't let them watch overly sexual stuff. We watch Futurama, Bob's Burgers, etc. If it goes too far we pause and discuss. 

The Queen forbid us from a LOT of stuff on TV. ""The Mighty Morphine Power Rangers?"" Totally about drugs. Once Aunt Becky joined the cast on full house it was banned for being overly sexual. The Simpson's was a hard no. She frequently pearl clutched about the stuff my kids watched. 

3. Growing up I was forced to eat basically everything. I have sensory issues and this was straight up hell for me. I have an autistic daughter and the Queen frequently told me to just force her to eat stuff. Even after we got a diagnosis. 

4. I don't have shit fits till my kids do as I ask. I frequently was told that if I was just more aggressive about them doing chores they would. She only had to yell sometimes! Yeah we were terrified so we usually snapped to if she wanted something done. 

Those are just a few. Anyone else have examples of their mother or MIL disagreeing with parenting choices?"
195,"Years ago, I was suicidal. I'm good now, but I feel I have to tell someone about this time.",Sanftmut,0,2,12,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536078632.0,9cx8x9,"So... the thing is, I never told people I had suicidal thoughts, because I felt it was unfair to do that. Probably because my father sometimes used it as a threat to us. And because I didn't want to be a burden to someone else, and thinking I could kill myself would be a burden for other people. Even if I was never close to do it. 

I remember that I didn't want those thoughts. They just came. I mean, it might be obvious that you don't want to be suicidal, but it frightened me how subtly they slid into my conciousness. Like a warmhearted, creepy whisper telling me the pain could be gone. And I remember some stupid thought like ""Oh, that's how you get those thoughts"", because before I wondered why people could ever see that as an option. And I felt like it's really wrong to think that and that telling someone would be emotional blackmailing to care for me. I guess I wanted that someone cared without that... 

&#x200B;

And even years later... when I tried to tell people I have depression and they were like ""No, you are fine. Look at how much you've accomplished"" I never used the argument of ""But I was suicidal, so I guess it really was bad."" I felt like I had to keep that fact to myself, because it's so severe it would force people to do something about it or at least to believe me... or maybe I was afraid it would just sound like that ""attention seeking"" thing and make everything worse. 

&#x200B;

I don't know. I never told someone. But often I wished someone knew. I wished someone cared about the fact that I was so miserable life felt unbearable. 

&#x200B;

I also had a very angry period. After I had tried to tell people about my depression and they didn't believe me, I had really angry thoughts of killing myself just to show them they were wrong. I wanted to write a farewell letter only saying ""You could have known"". In this period things were already getting better and my anger was probably a healthy sign of me feeling my needs. Though sometimes the anger got so massive I felt like going crazy and was really afraid I might act on that anger. Afraid of losing control over everything. I remember that I told myself in those moment ""It will be gone in ten minutes. You just have to deal with this for ten minutes. You can do that"", and I went outside my flat and just walked. Kept walking and telling myself that in ten minutes, I will regain the feeling that I want to live. I usually calmed down, went  home and cried about my life. 

&#x200B;

I guess these thoughts are part of my past, and I want them to be a part of my story. Maybe just because it's the truth. I don't want to exclude that part anymore, I don't want to live up to that image other people created for me. 

&#x200B;

I'm not good at trusting that people would help me. So maybe, keeping those thoughts for myself was also to protect myself from any reactions that would have made it worse. Currently, I'm trying to learn to let people see when I need them. Let them see when I need some care. Maybe that's why I want this off my chest now. I want to tell someone that I was at this dark place with little to no hope. I'm not that strong, happy person everyone else sees in me. (Please don't say: ""But you are strong for fighting depression"" or anything in that direction. Might be true, but my whole life that kind of argument was used to gaslight me into thinking I don't need or deserve help.)

Not the easiest person to get along with but I have always been nice and respectful with her. She started showing her true colors with me when husband and I got engaged, cue the passive aggressive comments and general bitchiness. Nothing too crazy right? Little mean 'jokes' just to jab me here and there. I told husband about it and his response was to ignore it she's 'just crazy' and reassure me that she indeed cares for me she just doesn't know how to handle being social sometimes. This is how he copes with her, by ignoring what's going on so he doesn't have to deal with it. His tolerance for her bullshit is soooooo high. I have never had to deal with someone like his mother, my family doesn't play mean with each other. She has referred to my family as the Brady bunch in the past. I realize now that by me not standing up to her and calling her out when she was rude and mean to me ealrier in the relationship, only paved the way for her to continue her dysfunctional behavior. I see the error in me trying to be nice and keep the peace/don't disrespect his mom. 

Fast forward to my pregnancy, she was being nice to me! Supportive and calm, and I tried my best to keep her updated on the baby throughout the 9 motnhs. Maybe me having a baby was the peace we needed for our relationship to improve?...WRONG. 

Husband had tried and tried again to get the 3 of us together before the big day, a week before I was due. She doesn't make the effort to keep plans with my husband, something that hurts his feelings bc she is always being a flake. She flakes on dinner plans that husband has been trying to arrange for a week now. He's upset with her and her lack of communication. She had an excuse as always and manipulates it to make husband feel bad for getting upset. This scenario happens a lot in their relationship, I see him feeling bad or guilty about things that aren't his fault. I'm annoyed but we go to bed not thinking too much about it. Next day I get a text, she's outside on my porch and wants to come in, she has gifts. WTF? I am heavily pregnant at this time and resting. She blew off dinner plans, is fighting with my husband and now wants me to let her in while my husband is at work bc she has gifts without letting me know she's coming over? Um. No. I text back saying she should come back when her son is home. She never replied. I didn't want visitors and didn't want her to think it was ok to come over unannounced especially after fighting with my husband the night before. This turned into a fight between him and his mom.

There were known complications with my pregnancy that resulted in me having a scheduled csection and my son being taken to NICU. When his mom came to visit that day she made a comment that I was a good incubator. An incubator? Being stressed about my baby in NICU and on all kinds of drugs in the hospital I didn't know what to say. She laughed at her joke and left. It did make me feel unsettled but I had enough on my plate to ignore it. Another, well she doesn't know what to say because she is awkward, it's not her fault scenario. 

We get home after 5 days and husband invites her over to see the baby. She makes the remark to my husband and I, as she is looking down at my sleeping infant, if there is a milkman or postman we should know about since my son doesn't look anything like my husband and has color to his skin, followed by snickering because that is the way she 'jokes.' WHAT THE FUCK. I'm half Hispanic half white and my husband is white, everyone thought I would have a blonde hair blue eyed baby, well guess what? The Latin genes are strong in this momma! He came out with dark, thick beautiful hair and more color to his skin. Fucking gorgeous. I said that's not nice but was ignored. Well this comment brings out full on post partum meltdown from me. I was beyond hurt and cried so hard after she left. Husband didn't say anything to her when she made the comment. I tell him how I felt about her visit and the comment and he tells me I have to deal with his mom bc he had already fought with her the week prior and he doesn't want to be in the middle anymore. He agreed it wasn't nice and will talk to her but that I need to stand up to her more if she is ever going to respect me. I get it, but looking back, two weeks postpartum was NOT the time for him to get upset and tell me to deal with it. Still pissed at him for that one. I text her about it the next day, how the comment hurt my feelings, was unnecessarily mean and if she could keep her rude comments to herself. Nothing. Not a text back or anything. She decides to call husband instead and he supports me and tells her indeed she was rude. A week later I get a call from her, she apologizes and doesn't realize how sensitive I am, sarcastically. She says it was a joke they used to make with her all the time with her sons and she didn't realize it was rude, it's just a joke. It was never in her intentions to hurt me. She basically played it out like I was overreacting and she exaggerated how she just doesn't know when she is being mean, it's not her fault. I didn't say much, thank you for the apology, your comment did hurt my feelings no matter if they didn't hurt yours when you were a mom and please keep your mean comments to yourself. Then she asks if she can come over to watch the baby so I can go out to do whatever I need to get a break. Immediately I say no thank you and tell her I need to go. My child is 3 weeks old for fucks sake and you just laughed it off that you hurt my feelings and you want me to leave so you can watch him? Fuck you. 

Since then the issue has gotten worse. We had extended family over this weekend and she told everyone that she wants my son to call her bitch instead of grandma, she said to me she wants to give me the evil eye so that I will go away and leave her with my son, that when I visit husbands family up north that she can get me a plane ticket back home and leave my son there so they can babysit, all of this being said as a 'joke.' Yep, it's just her humor and she can't help it. Ugh.

This has caused my husband and I to fight. When she says these things to me, I tell her that's not nice or I don't think that's funny which she brushes off and continues to be snarky. Husband says nothing to her when she makes these comments and doesn't really care about it until I tell him that this is not ok. I don't have thick skin like he does and neither does our newborn son. He is here to support me but doesn't want to make a scene in front of other family when his mom is being ugly and also says he doesn't want me to make a scene either. And boy does she love an audience. Her level of mean goes up around her friends and family. (I guess for attention?) I tried to explain to him that if it was any other person other than his mom talking to me like that and making rude jokes he would be livid and up in arms. But when it comes to his mom being mean he feels we need to handle it differently because it's his mom. 

I am honestly at my breaking point with her. I don't blame him for getting frustrated with me about this, it must be hard to stand up to her after years of ignoring this behavior. It has to be hard to evaluate the situation and realize that the status quo of let my mom be mean and ignore it does not and will not apply going forward. I hear him when he says I need to stand up to her more but I feel he needs to stand up to her more as well. I am trying and getting nowhere with her and it has gotten worse since I've been trying to find my voice. I feel like I need him with me as a team more than ever. Now that I am a mother I do not want to raise my child in a toxic environment where it's ok for grandma to be mean to mommy and daddy. I don't want to allow her to be mean to my son bc she 'does not know any better' or that being mean is funny. Hell no.

How can I handle this? She is progressively getting meaner and I don't particularly feel comfortable seeing her or allowing her to see my son after the last comments she's made about separating me from my child. Also, we have more family coming in this weekend that I don't want to be a part of. I honestly need a break from her, these situations stress me out and is affecting my milk supply, it's not fair to me or my son. Do husband and I sit down and have a talk with her? Should I tell him to deal with his mom or should I deal with her? How the hell do I deal with her? It's clear she isn't listening to what I have to say and I don't want to stoop to her level of being mean. It's not who I am as a person and I don't want to give her more reasons to play the clueless victim.

I love my husband and son dearly and want a healthy relationship moving forward with his mom. I don't want to deny her a chance of being a grandma but cannot allow this behavior to be the norm. Why can't she just be a nice human being and a loving grandma???? Thank you for reading, sorry for such a long post.

197,"Teenage cousin being abused by her nmom, what do I do?",ImmediateEjection,0,2,5,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536095853.0,9cztn0,"[TW physical and emotional abuse]

My cousin (pseudonym for story purposes is Alice) is 16 years old and has recently disclosed that she has been physically and emotionally abused by her mother since she was 5. She is an only child. 

Recently, Alice has been in trouble with the law. The first time, she allegedly chased her mother with a kitchen knife, the second time, she physically hit a neighbor. Alice insists that she did not chase her mother with the knife and she says that she did hit the neighbor but that the neighbor was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. (She said that her mother had started a physical altercation with her that was brought to the neighbor’s home, during which Alice lashed out at the neighbor.) Alice was placed in the custody of my mother (her aunt) and has been for about two weeks.

For background, Alice says that her mother will physically attack her (holding her by the face, pulling her hair, slamming her onto the ground, punching her, etc.), then when Alice tries to defend herself, her mother calls the police and reports that her daughter is abusing her. The attacks are unprovoked and seem to be sparked by a 16 year old acting like a 16 year old - slightly bratty, a little sarcastic, but nothing major.

Alice says that if she is upset, her mother immediately becomes angry and tells her how much harder her own life is than Alice’s. Alice is unable to talk to her mother or receive advice from her because she is so aggressive. Her mother will call her horrible names (ex. Slut) or say terrible things (ex. I wish I never had you.) Since Alice has been with my mother, her mother keeps saying that Alice is hurting her by not answering her calls or texts. She says that Alice is rude for not doing so. It seems like everything is about Alice’s mother.

Alice herself is a very small, timid girl who was spoiled by her mother. She is a little bratty but all teenagers are. I’ve never seen her be aggressive or violent with anyone but her mother. She went to court over the neighbor battery charge and the judge is determined to send Alice back to her mother after two individual counseling sessions each and two group counseling sessions together.

Alice’s mother has never been diagnosed but I’m pretty sure she’s a narcissist. I know that people with personality disorders rarely get better and I am nervous about the fact that Alice may have to go live there again. Alice didn’t speak up during the court hearing about her physical fights with her mother as being self-defense because her mother was present.

I’m worried about her. What can I do to keep her with my mother and, therefore, safe? If Alice has the police called on her again, she will go to juvenile detention. She’s not that kind of kid but everyone believes her mother over her.

Thank you for any help you can give."
198,How can I help my girlfriend with her narcissistic mother ?,TAMokty,0,4,11,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536061654.0,9cuv7c,"My girlfriend's mother is a alcoholic, has strong depressions and is really manipulative. Just yesterday she got into a fight with my girlfriend because her mother repeatedly told her, that she want's to kill herself. My girlfriend messaged me and asked if she could come over and I told her sure she can. So she arrived here and her mother messaged her a picture of herself crying to guilttrip her. And then she sent her messages like ""I do everything for you."", ""I will never contact you again."" etc. 

I was kinda shocked, I'm in a relationship with my girlfriend since 2 years, and she often told me about her mother being an alcoholic, and also abusive, but I would have never thought that she would behave like that.

The worst thing is tho, that I can't have my girlfriend come over at the moment. I have really important stuff to do for work, and I just can't have her over. I told her that she can come over for 2 weeks but only next week, until then I just can't because I would get in trouble. She told me she understands that and I believe her, but I still want to help her. You guys are or were in her position once and I just want to know from you people, what would you have wished for or what do you wish for when you were in that position ? "
199,The Time Republimom kicked me out and got mad at me for being outside,ThrowThatAssAwayYo,0,66,815,False,JUSTNOMIL,only sucks vegan dick,1536080389.0,9cxjba,"This story comes when I was still undiagnosed with my severe as shit ADHD and Republimom blamed my inability to focus on “laziness.” I dreaded going home every day because it meant hours of screaming. I was only thirteen and I decorated the area around my bed with a series of dates written on paper. Those were the dates that I wanted to kill myself of self-harm but didn’t. A thirteen-year-old shouldn’t have that. She should have a volleyball poster or a lipgloss-smudged Jonas brothers cardboard cutout (or whatever the kids are into these days).

​

Anyway, I got in the car with Republimom and she started doing her typical screaming and I did something I’d never done before: I greyrocked. I greyrocked as fuck. I just sat there and let the ADHD daydreams take me away.

​

We were MAYBE two minutes down the road when she pulls over and orders me out of the car and tells me to find my own way home. I gladly oblige. I mean, it’s maybe a five minute drive from my school to home, and the route is basically straight, left, driveway. It was along some busy sidewalk-less main roads but I could walk in the grass, no biggie.

​

Maybe 20 minutes goes by and I see Republimom’s black car appear again, and my heart fucking sinks. I’m about to be herded back into hell. She picks me up in the car, and is screaming at me again for walking along the major roads because “what would people think if they saw you walking home on the side of the road? They’d think I’m a bad mother!”

​

So it’s ok to kick your child out of a car and make them walk home alone, as long as no one looks down on you for it. K."

 “Vulnerability in self-esteem which makes narcissistic people very sensitive to ‘injury’ from criticism or defeat.

They react with disdain, rage, or defiant counterattack.

If you have an argument with a narcissist, they will blame you for making them angry. It’s almost impossible to get your point across because they won’t listen.

What they will do is say that  you criticized them, you’re trying to control them, you are wrong and you need to apologize.

They will then come back oozing charm and seduction, trying to seduce you back into their arms."""

Neither of us could remember for sure what our moms wore to our wedding, so we pulled out our wedding album. My mother wore ivory, MIL wore champagne. Not like a little bit, but their dresses were solid colored, my mother’s had beading, and neither of them ever wore their dresses again. (My mother also wore white to my sister’s wedding, and MIL wore off-white to BIL’s wedding, but not to SIL’s.) 

My mom and MIL compete over absolutely everything and are passive aggressive AF. It’s like a constant duel between them. MIL takes great joy in the fact that she beats my mom solidly whenever cost is involved, and my mom spends a lot of money trying to outdo her, anyway. I really didn’t think anything of it at the time, and I didn’t remember what they wore, but of course it was shades of white. "

204,Just answer the damn phone!,Castawaycoffeepot,0,60,299,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536084725.0,9cy7vs,"I saw a comment on a r/aww post that reminded me of this incident. It happened not too long ago, may a week/week and a half. 

We were staying with my in laws while we were finding a house. (We found one and are out of there!!!) My youngest son is in the stage of “talking” on the phone. He has an old Motorola flip phone that has been past down from both of his older brothers to play with. One of his favorite things to do is go around to everyone in the house and telling them “for you!” It’s adorable and easy to play. You take the phone, say ‘thank you’ to youngest son and pretend to talk on the phone for a few seconds before handing it back! Then youngest son takes the phone and runs off to the next person!

But this wouldn’t be posted here if my MIL took the time to fuel his imagination. Nope. MIL looks at the phone with a sneer and says “I’m not taking that.” Then walks away. Poor little guy didn’t know what to do. So he tries again to hand it to her. My MIL takes it this time, but instead of ‘answering’ it she flips it closed and puts it on a counter where youngest son can’t reach.

Luckily the little guy has an awesome older sister who saw the whole thing go down. She takes the the phone and pretends to answer it before giving it back to her baby brother. 

I know that this is a mild story compared to others but I still wanna shake the bitch for not playing along. The kid isn’t even 2 yet! It takes 30 seconds out of your life to make him happy, just answer the damn phone!

205,Living with MIL coming to an end.,alienschool,0,24,35,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536091572.0,9cz7hh,"So I've lived with MIL for about 2 years and pay market rate for a room with other people's shit in it and the washer and dryer, resulting in minimal amounts of privacy. 

I have so many fond memories such as peeing in a bucket when someone decides to close the bathroom door while brushing their teeth or getting dressed resulting in my having bladder problems, having my personal items rummaged through and taken, my MIL yelling at me, MIL talking about white trash specifically while I'm in the room, and MIL having DH lie to his uncle so she could get some of DH's college money for who knows what, but WAIT! There's more! I've written and erased so many potential posts regarding living with her and my two BILs, one SIL, and DH.

Now things are finally coming to an end and we're getting our own apartment. I can finally rest easy, maybe put on some of the weight I lost due to stress, and finally get the privacy to have sex with my husband without MIL banging on the door to tell him that he left his mail on the kitchen table at 10:00 at night. Sweet, sweet memories.

One final nail in the coffin, MIL refuses to let DH take the one item he received from his GM when she was moved to assisted living. A nice wood desk. She says that she'll take it to us when it's the ""right time"". She says the crime rate is high where we're moving. It's my hometown. I've gotten more things taken and destroyed at her house than any other place from her and SIL. Needless to say, it's a bunch of horse shit and I know it has to be a final ploy for power over him. I don't want her to visit, neither does he. I don't want to ever give her our new address. Don't think he cares if she ever gets it. But fuck, I'm fuming over the desk thing. She always has to take everything good and turn it against us. DH says fuck it, he doesn't want it anymore, which yeah, it cuts off her way in to his life. But I just can't fucking let this go. Like, it's his decision to take the desk or not and I tell him that his grandma and uncle want him to have it and she got all of GM's other furniture. Why can't she let him have one goddamn thing? She takes and takes. Money and favors and dignity and everything she can get her greedy idiot hands on, but nothing good comes from it because she's just a miserable person and is never satisfied.

I just feel so angry. I fucking hate it. I want so desperately to make a giant stink in the end and just school her on how awful she is. So far, the best I can think to say without having flying monkeys is just to tell her how happy our lives will be without her. I just hope NC will be enough for me at this point. I know she's trying to be manipulative with the desk but FUCK. I hate that she always feels like she wins and everybody bends over backwards to please her.

Advice is appreciated. I'm just so damn done with this bitch."
206,I'm losing my mind,antisocialprincess92,0,19,97,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536088077.0,9cypbn,"I have posted previously about my future MIL and how she recently joined Primerica. 

Since then, things have been extremely stressful between me (26/F) and my bf (27/M). From the very beginning I was skeptical and expressed my opinion to her, urging her to reconsider. She rejected everything I had to say and convinced my bf to attend a presentation, and to bring me along. We were lied multiple times by her new boss, who was so clearly a con man who figured out pretty quickly there was no way I was leaving my medical billing job with full benefits for Primerica. He did think he had a shot convincing my bf who is 3 months away from getting his degree to become an accountant that he should throw that dream away and join his mom's ""team"", though. 

Since then, my bf's mom has tried relentlessly to convince my bf that he should work with her. That Primerica is so legit and being an accountant would be a waste of time. That he'll be making 60k a year, which is nothing compared to what he could make at Primerica. That everything we've found online, proving her boss to be a complete liar who has been to court multiple times for wage garnishment, is not what it looks like. That her boss is really a millionaire. 

A week ago she called my bf, saying that he owes her 1500 for money that was gifted to him over a year ago. This was after my bf made the mistake of telling her about the scholarship he'd just received, which would cover the rest of his schooling. She originally said this 1500 was sent from his uncle in Mexico and it was never established that this was a loan before. Ever. But now it is. Supposedly she can't pay her mortgage but my bf's brother who lives with her rent-free knows nothing about that. She was just on a trip to Florida this past weekend for a Primerica conference, which she had to have financed herself, despite being broke and in debt from living off credit for nearly 2 years. 

My bf told her via text that he won't pay her the money until she quits Primerica. That he will help her as long as she is going to make good financial choices. Otherwise she is going to continue needing his financial support that he simply cannot afford to provide regularly. She texted him back, belittling his career dreams and shaming him for not supporting her. Saying she is heartbroken over his words and his skepticisim. That he is not realizing his true potential by going to school for accounting and he is making a mistake by not joining her. 

I was **livid**. I actually started crying when he was telling me what she texted to him. To think a mom could say that to her son, who has been working so hard in college and is so close to graduating....it is bewildering to me. I have a seven year old and can't imagine speaking to my son that way when he is working to achieve his goals that will give him an honest income.  I wanted to call her up and pop off at her but it took everything I had not to. I seriously don't want to see this woman again. I don't want to be around her in any capacity. What she is doing is making me so angry, I can't even fully express the anger I feel. I know that you're not supposed to alienate the person whom you're trying to help out of an MLM/cult but at this point I don't even care. I don't care what happens to her as long as she doesn't think my bf is doing a single thing for her. I feel like a bad person for thinking this way but I can't help it. She crossed the line and has no remorse. 

I can't help but worry that this will tear me and my bf apart. He still gives his mom the benefit of the doubt and says her actions are just a result of the brainwashing her MLM has done to her. As much as I can believe that has had an effect, I don't find that to be enough of an excuse for her numerous attempts to manipulate and shame my bf into allowing her to **scam** him. Family has got to mean more than some ""business opportunity"". 

I doubt this is the end of this craziness. I think she is going to break my bf down so badly that he helps her, and I'm worried. He is clearly hurt by that conversation. Even if he is sticking to his guns about the money right now, I do not doubt she will continue trying to manipulate him. I just want her to go away and stop making this our problem. "

So last year, I was  accepted into my dream university. It was the university I have wanted  to go to since I was in middle school, and I got accepted AND got into  the program that I wanted to, which was really hard to do. I also got a  lot of scholarships, so I would have covered 70-80% of the costs alone.  My parents did not want to help me cover any costs, so instead of  accumulating student debt, I just went to community college.

Now,  since community college is way cheaper than the university I wanted to  go to, I literally had so much money left over. Now, my mom knows that  and she is like ""You need to give that to your parents! You're going to  spend it all we need to control it! We need to put it into our account!""  I told my mom no I want it to STAY in my account, but she keeps arguing  and threatening to bring my dad into this (who I am afraid of). They  might kick me out or whatever, which I don't mind at this point. I hate  being controlled for everything I do. I got scholarships to go to  college, straight As during my senior year of high school while taking  AP courses, I got a job where I am starting my own business and I'm  becoming successful, but my parents don't congratulate me for anything.  My dad did not even show up to my high school graduation. But now all of  a sudden, when I have some money, they get to take it. They did not pay  A PENNY for my college education, but yet they're entitled to the  money?

I  went and took the SAT MULTIPLE times to get a good score. I'm the one  that stood up till 3 am sometimes studying to make sure that I pass that  test. They literally did nothing. Smh.

And  they're honestly controlling every aspect of my life and it's driving  me insane. I can't stay after class at college to study and it's so  noisy in the house sometimes. They put a tracking device on my phone to  know where I am at all times. It's like I cant breathe without my  parent's permission. This has affected me so much emotionally. People,  even teachers, call my parents insane. I tried working out stuff with  them in the past, but I always end up getting screamed at and verbally  abused. I tried to runaway from my house to a friends, but the friend  ended up bailing on me. I had all my stuff packed and everything, but  she never showed up. When I contacted her about it, she just blocked me.

I don't know what to do anymore. I'm on the brink of insanity."

I had sex with guy A, between December 30-January 4th. That was the last time we ever had sex. I got a period on January the 23rd, and I started having a sexual relationship with guy B, around the middle of January. I know the exact dates I ovulated.. Feb 6th-8th. This is when I conceived. I got my first positive pregnancy test on February 17th. I had my very first ultrasound done on March 9th, which showed I was measuring 6 weeks and 1 day. My mother has came with me to doctors appointments and the ultrasound tech said I am measuring perfect. Not ahead at all. My mother acts like she believes me, then goes behind my back and tells my grandmother she knows it isn't his, and it's guys A. This is literally impossible. Guy A is black, and guy B is white/Asian. I am biracial myself (black and white). I got a 4D ultrasound done, and she says the baby looks like the first guy and has ""black features"". I can't help this. I told her that yes, the ultrasound is somewhat how the baby is going to look, but of course his nose looks alittle bigger, and his features are more prominent because he is squished up inside the womb. She texted my grandmother today saying ""there's no way"", and ""to check her calander and look at the dates"". I am extremely offended she continues to go behind my back and say my child's father isn't his father, and then pretends to my face she knows it is his. Then, she told my grandmother to delete the messages because ""sometimes I look in her phone"".

The father and I are getting a DNA test and are no longer together, and I can't wait to show her the results that it is his. Even the doctors have said right infront of her that the baby is right on track, and my report says ""size is consistent with dates"". There's no way I conceived in the beginning of January and got a menstrual cycle on the 23rd. And doctors ultrasounds are not going to be this far off. I am so fed up of my mother going behind my back, saying these things. It's offensive, and I am to the point now I just want to leave her out of the rest of this pregnancy. Am I wrong for not wanting her in the delivery room? At this point, I just want to be in there alone. I am tired of the stress and constant ""back stabbing"" from my own family

Now Jim is just the guy that Mom and I take care of. 

I'm currently reading the story of Regina Calcaterra and the severely harsh upbringing she endured with her sisters and brother. In the book, ""Etched in Sand"" (and her sister Rosie's book, ""Girl Unbroken""), they called their mother ""Cookie"" because she was their mother in blood, but not in any other sense of the term. 

Now, I'd never say my upbringing was anywhere close to what those siblings went through, and I feel guilt even adapting this emotional tool from them, but in the passed two days I've mentally changed the way I think of my father from ""Dad"" to ""Jim"" has actually worked wonders. 

No more rabbit-hole thinking for me of, ""Dad's mad, what did I do? I just got home, I thought I did everything right today, why is he taking it out on me? Why is it always like this? Why does he hate me so much? My chest is tightening already - I hop he doesn't pick up on that, then he'll really go off."" 

Now it's just, ""Jim's silently fuming at us? That's just Jim for you. Jim's got issues that I can't help or fix. Whatever. I have some laundry to fold.""

The abuse is quite extreme and made worse by the fact that it really happened), “Chinese Cinderella,” “The Little Princess,” “Matilda,” heck even “Harry Potter” just to name a few.  The abuse laid out in these are quite straightforward, and I remember reading them thinking, “I’d hate to be in their shoes. This is so terrible. These adults treating their child like that is awful. My parents wouldn’t do that.  My parents wouldn’t hurt me. My family is normal.”  It felt like the abuse didn’t apply to me, they were foreign to me. I was convinced my parents loved me and cared about me. 

But it’s like I didn’t see my own messed up situation when I was younger. It’s only now in my 20s that I am starting to see it and I’m just thinking how was I so blind to what was happening.  I never knew I was a victim. I couldn’t see it and even now I have a hard time digesting it and accepting the fact that these people are hurting me and treating me less than I deserve.  Perhaps with personality disorders like narcissism the hallmarks of traditional abuse can sometimes be missing and it’s harder to grasp. 

It’s so weird to think about. Our mind can really play tricks on us trying to deny our own reality. I’ve been reading about ill treatment yet couldn’t  see the one I was dealing with. 

But it’s right in front of my eyes and I still can’t quite grasp it. It’s there! It’s telling me my nparents did nothing to stop it when the GC tried to choke me.  It’s telling me my parents didn’t reprimand him when he physically abused me. The uneven treatment is right in front of my face and I still have a part of me in denial. 

DAE deal with this weird thing where you can’t fully grasp it? Like where you constantly doubt and still have hope that it’s not what it is?"
214,"""You need to cut out the toxic people in your life.""",asphaltdragon,0,5,31,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536076985.0,9cwzcs,"I had someone suggest posting this here after seeing it on /r/MaliciousCompliance so I copied it and posted it in full, including my edit.

So this story is actually about a year old, but I remembered it the other day and decided to post it.

Now for a little backstory. I was 26, in-the-closet trans, depressed, and still entirely dependant on my parents for everything. I worked for my dad. I rented a room in my dad's rental house. My parents co-signed my loan on my car. I was securely under my thumb, and they used that to their advantage.

I had a bad habit of not getting out of bed when my alarm went off. Depression is a bitch. And this morning was like any other at this point. Laying in bed at 9AM, after I was supposed to be up at 7AM. Understandably, my dad is angry, and as he has a key to the rental, busts through my door. I really didn't wanna hear it, so I pretended to be asleep.

What followed was the longest, most painful 30 minutes of my life. Apparently I'm terrible at pretending to be asleep, or my dad is terrible at realizing I'm actually awake. He said he knew I was awake, but I still don't know if I believe him. I don't remember what he said, but a few things stuck out to me.

""Your friends are fake, they don't care about you.""

""You are not a transvestite."" (Of course I'm not, that's something different entirely. Validation, yay.)

""I declare death and destruction on those who would misled you."" (Did I mention my parents were religious?)

***""You need to cut these toxic people out of your life.""***

Oh boy, did I take that last bit to heart. I contacted all of my gaming friends to see if any of them had a place I could stay, saved up, bought a bus ticket, and three months later, at midnight, February 1st, I was on a bus travelling ten hours to Houston, with nothing but three suitcases containing my essentials.

Apparently when my dad told me to cut the toxic people out of my life, he didn't realize that was him and my mom. According to my sister, they are not doing as good.

Careful what you preach, I guess.

EDIT: I did not expect this to have the type of response it has. I should probably clarify a few things.

I left because I was being controlled by the things my parents had provided for me. They were holding them over my head. My dad is less to blame for this than my mom is, she was the one that held them over my head.

My dad is not nearly as bad as my mom, and is doing much better. They've both accepted me now, but back then, my entire family was emotionally abusive without realizing it, with the exception of my dad.

They aren't doing much better now, and I am. I don't know the specifics, except my mom cheated on my dad (for the third time, twice within the year). They're supposedly in divorce proceedings now and she's trying to get everything.

My dad had closed down his business that I was working at a few months before I left, and I was helping him flip houses, which he was trying to get into doing. He had taken out a lot of loans, and is most surely in a lot of debt now.

To be honest, if anyone is at fault here, it's my mom. She's narcissistic, controlling, and was basically using my dad, and still is, AFAIK."
215,Langauge Barrier *almost* messed up DH's meds,floweryscientist,0,29,283,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536076675.0,9cwxcp,"Hi all!

I just wanted to start this post off by saying thank you for your advice on the last one. As many of you said, DH does not have to be involved in his Aunt's estate and we are very grateful.

Now onto some llama drama from about a month ago! Language Barrier (LB) has been told by many doctors to lose weight. And every time she refuses, stating that they have a distorted sense of what is healthy. Guys, when she makes stir-fry for her family of 3 so uses 4 clubhouse stir-fry packages. Lawd. This is relevant I promise!

So it turns out that LB became close friends with one of the French secretaries when DH was still a teenager in the hospital. Even better -MIL called her last month to talk. Just to confirm - I am married to DH and he has changed his POA/NOK to me. LB has zero permissions to contact any of his healthcare team. But apparently this secretary wasn't clear on this. So she and LB are talking and then she remembers, oh wait, the doctor asked me to call DH and ask for his current weight (since his bloodwork showed his med levels to be low they wanted to see if it was weight related). So what does this woman do? She asks LB because she can't speak English very well and surely LB would know her own son's weight.

But remember, LB doesn't understand that her normal is actually overweight and such, so she greatly over estimates DH's weight. The secretary writes it down and they both go on their way. At approximately 8 am the next day DH gets a very serious call from his healthcare team. They need to speak with him asap. We are panicking. We know the bloodwork is abnormal. DH calls and they tell him through broken English that his meds need increased immediately. He will need to come to the hospital 6 hours away and be monitored because the increase could cause kidney failure. That is a lot to absorb. But DH is medically saavy and asks them why. They tell him that his medication dosages are not in line with his weight. And then it goes like this:

DH: My weight? I never told you my weight and nobody here was weighed me recently. (saying this while walking over to the bathroom scale to weigh himself)

Receptionist: Yes weight. We got weight on (yesterday) over the phone.

DH: You didn't call me yesterday. You must have somebody else.

Receptionist: No, you are (full DH name and date of birth). 

DH: Yes but nobody has called me or weighed me. What was the weight?

Receptionist: (reads out weight)

DH: well I just weighed myself here and I am (actual weight).

The receptionist proceeded to be confused (bilingual hospital my ass) and had to transfer DH several times. 

Upon hearing this one of DH's doctors became frustrated and called DH. This doctor is mainly English and listened while DH explained what had happened. The doctor then contacted some internal hospital people and they launched an investigation. DH's weight was fine and the bloodwork returned to normal with no intervention thank heavens.

Its been a while and the investigation results just came back. They found the phone number and traced it to LB. The secretary has been fired for a breach in confidentially and DH was sent an official apology. 

Side note: many of you have asked why we don't transfer to an English hospital. We have tried many times. There are none close by. And the French hospital refuses to transfer DH because of the distance thing, but we suspect it is because he is involved in much of their research which = $$$$ for them. We have had friends who work in medicine actually find papers published by the hospital and DH's doctors using his health data (anonymously of course). Also, all his health records are in French and we would have to pay big bucks for them to be translated. 

Update: LB denies it all. She says she would never do anything like that. We have been trying to password protect his healthcare info but apparently French hospital doesn't do that. Any ideas?"
216,"In laws are raising their grandkids, DH wants them to live near us eventually.",WillingFennel,0,11,19,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536108710.0,9d1h0f,"\*TL;DR\* My in laws are raising my nieces and nephews because they did a bad job with their own daughter who lost them to the court, and at some point it might become our problem too. 

I love my in laws, they're kind and warm and treat me better than my own parents. BUT they have terrible judgment and zero boundaries, and now they're raising their grandkids probably with those same exact issues. My SIL lost her kids due to neglect and is delusional about getting them back. My in laws live states away and are now raising the three little ones (ages 2-10). We send them money monthly to help with expenses because they don't have a lot of money themselves, and my SIL isn't sending enough if any (wage garnishment is likely). We do this for the children, and because we can't really help any other way through time or visits, for a few reasons.

DH and I are talking about moving across the country to warmer places in the spring, and the other day DH mentioned that we should see if his parents eventually want to join us with the kids, ""so we can help raise them too"". On paper, this sounds kind and nice, but we're childfree on purpose so I didn't put a ton of stock into the idea (especially since the court would have to ok that). 

Shortly after that theoretical conversation, we discovered that my MIL allowed a probable child molester to stay at their home for a few days. He tried something with my niece and they kicked him out, but this man had a rep for that long before he wound up at their home - and they let him in anyway. DH suffered abuse at the hands of his bio-dad and he insists his mom still doesn't know to this day, I suspect that she does know and is complete denial about it.

This situation is stressful for everyone involved for all different reasons, but now I find myself thinking about those kids being raised in a perpetual cycle of terrible judgment and few boundaries. She's trying with them, she has them in structured school and after school/weekend activities, but the saying is, ""if you don't raise your kids right, the grandparents have to"" - but she raised her kid the way she did that resulted in her raising MORE kids, because she did a bad job before.

I know that we marry the family like we marry the spouse, but this is more than I can get my head around sometimes. All the emails we exchange about money and birthday presents and them begging us to visit and me explaining why we simply can't (we're both hourly with no PTO yet, require four flights round trip, hotel, and dog sitting funds), it feels like we're ""helping"" with our money but at the end of the day, the kids are still being exposed to some potentially really bad crap."

**Backstory**:

I'm 7 months pregnant with my first child - I live in the U.K. and Mum lives in France. I have 2 step kids who stay with me and their Dad (my partner) on weekends and school holidays. I work from home and my partner works in an office; the first half of the summer break the kids stayed at ours so I was working and looking after them. They're super easy going, but it's still hard work to look after 2 kids, work, and be the size of a whale (due to pregnancy)!

At the beginning of August, DH's Father came to stay with us due to a dispute in their family home. Long story cut very short - there's this law surrounding emotional abuse now in the U.K. which can often be 'relied' upon when there's a domestic dispute. DH's Father had a verbal argument with his youngest Son which resulted in him being arrested. He's on police bail with the condition that he can't go back to the family home until the situation is 'resolved'. He pleaded not-guilty at his plea hearing in court, this means he has to attend a trial. His trial date is 15th November and our baby is due 12th November. As he has no other family and has multiple medical conditions, he has to stay with us or be homeless.

Without asking, when I first told my Mum that I was pregnant, she booked flight tickets over to the U.K. for a 3 week period around the time baby is due. She obviously assumed she was staying with us and that was that. I have difficulty communicating with her as she has her 'way' of persuading people to do things. Originally she was going to be at the birth and I plucked up the courage to tell her she wouldn't be.

**Situation**:

Today I have sent her a message explaining the situation with DH's Father and she won't be able to stay during the time she booked the flights for - though she is welcome to book a hotel for that time. I said I could perhaps fly to her at the end of the month for the weekend to see her, and she could book a flight for the first weekend of December to come and stay, but everything else was pretty much out of the question.

I explained to her that I didn't have any other choice given DH's Father would be made homeless otherwise, and made it clear that having him stay wasn't my choosing either, however, if any of our family were threatened with homelessness, we'd do the same.

**Text messages:**

This was her response: ""I can't tell you how upset I am feeling. First I will not be at the birth, I understand why. Now you don't wish me to be there at all! I hear what you're saying re: DH's Father but why??? I am not entirely surprised, as I don't hear from you any longer, just words of how busy you are always. I should be use to this by now but I am in pieces"".

I responded with: ""If you read what I wrote I never once said I didn't want you there. Neither of us decided anyone would stay with us for 3 months but we would never make our family homeless. If it were you, Dad, or anyone else, I would never turn you away. We've been put in an impossible situation. You are more than welcome to be here during the times you've booked but there's nowhere in the house to stay and I didn't feel it would be fair asking you to stay in a hotel. Saying you're not surprised is extremely hurtful - I talk to you as much as I talk to Dad and the rest of the family. I have been very busy with looking after the kids, working, and juggling pregnancy alongside the situation. I do not ignore you or choose not to speak to you. I think you need to put yourself in my position and understand how hard this is for me"".

She responded with: ""You have turned me away though! DH's family are well aware you are with child, couldn't they have just hung on for a few months? Of course it's not fair on you - what a knock on effect their behavior is having on us. Now I can't be with you! I had a Mother that never spoke to me on the phone, visited me once for 10 minutes and never made me feel welcome. Why a hotel?? You have 3 bedrooms!!"".

My response: ""I haven't turned you away, I said you're welcome but can't stay at our house. I also don't think family arguments are planned... I very much doubt they would have thought about anything else at the time so as much as it's not fair, don't blame them. I am also your daughter, not your Mother. I am not ignoring you and I am not purposely turning you away. This is no ones fault and it's a situation that we just have to deal with. At the end of the day, our baby will be born and everyone will get to see him, he will be loved, and that's my only focus right now. We also have a total of 4 adults and 2 kids and a baby due any moment, so a 3 bedroom house doesn't really mean anything"".

Her final response: ""I get it"".

&#x200B;

I feel really let down and disappointed by this. It's taken YEARS for us to build any form of Mother/Daughter relationship, and I feel she's thrown it back in my face. Am I overreacting to think this is really selfish of her? I put up with 12 years of physical abuse, and about 25 years of mental abuse from her... to forgive her and let her back into my life a few years ago now seems like a bad idea.

EDIT: This morning she sent me a message with a gif of ""good morning"", do I respond to that?"

We chickened out of sending Dubious our rules. When DH and I discussed it, we realized that most of them were just our regular rules (when we thought DS was neurotypical) and that we just needed to enforce them better. We also chickened out of telling Dubious in person. The only rule we added was that she was not to post about it on facebook, for DS’s future privacy. We also didn’t want her to use our child for likes and sympathy points, because fuck that. 

She took it well, and my annoyance with her reaction was mostly BEC. 

“I’m sorry. I know this must be hard on you and OP. At least now you can get services to help.”

I’m sorry??? We have been fighting for this a long time. This is not sad news. This is a sigh of fucking relief. Like, yeah, we get access to more services, but we have had SLPs for a year and a half. DH pointed it out and said it was upsetting for her to ignore that. 

She then went apology love-bombing and over the top. “Oh, we are just so proud of you!! You’ve done so much!!!!” Whatever, you have literally 0 clue. 

Yesterday, she apologized again for the comment about the services. It sounded sincere. 

Then she texted again, “I just never know what to say! It’s so hard to talk to you boys!”

Recently I miscarried and needed to get various tests done to confirm and that there wasn't any additional problems. The Dr phoned me this morning and luckily there wasn't any additional problems

When I turned 18 I went to my local health clinic and asked them to remove me from my parents account (in this country you're part of your parents ""medical insurance account"" including text updates and one website account until you ask to be removed). Somehow they made a mistake and didn't remove me from the account and I had no idea since I don't need to go the drs very often. 

So this afternoon my nmum gets a text saying *my name* results have arrived ..... She phones me and tells I got my tests results and started demanding I tell her what the tests were. I start telling her that it doesn't matter because im fine (she didn't know because it was still in early pregnancy). She kept insisting that she's my mother and that I have to tell her, I responded that she doesn't need to concern (pppfff concern....) herself because there's nothing wrong with me... she kept going and I eventually lost it and shouted at her that it's none of her business because im am adult and she can't force me and try to manipulate me into telling her. Her response was all too perfect: ""one day you will treat me like your mother and you will tell me""  I told her ok mum and hung up.

For the last two hours I've been frantically calling number after number to once again separate my account from my parents. I've so far managed to disconnect the phone number but I haven't yet been able to do the same for the website which is more problematic because only she knows the password (whether she's aware of that I don't know). Hopefully I'll finally manage to sort out the online account but I swear if she actually goes on and looks which she probably will if she's figured out she can im going NC for good. Vent over."

When my oldest turned 12 I started letting her wear crop tops. Nothing too short or provocative, but yes, her belly button showed. My mom would make little remarks/jokes about my daughter leaving half of her shirt at home or say she needs a refund because the store didn't give her the whole shirt. Que eye roll. When it really started to bug me was when my mom would ""jokingly"" pull on my daughters shirt to make it longer then complain that the top was now too low cut. . . *Um, duh. you just pulled on it!*
 I personally find nothing wrong with a cute crop top and am of the mindset that if you see something wrong with one on a child then you are the problem, not the child.


Now my daughter is 13 and has taken to big hoop earrings. My mom has a problem with this as well and told me that I need to put a stop to ""All of that"". Um, what the hell does that mean? I feel like she is implying that my child is going to wind up being a slut or something and it will be my fault because I let the girl wear some damn earrings and a short shirt!!! Ugh, maybe I'm wrong. (this may open a whole other can of worms but, while I obviously don't approve of my young daughter being sexually active, we have had age appropriate talks and I am very open with her. I don't believe a female should be shamed if she happens to enjoy sex)


Now to talk about my youngest daughter, she 2 &1/2 and I still breastfeed. My mom will scold her every time she asks to nurse. She tells my daughter that she is too big for that and that she need to eat food like a big girl. My daughter will then start crying and apologize for not being a big girl. WTF? Just leave my baby alone. She will quit when she is ready. And no I will NOT starve her until she is forced to eat ""real food"", why would you even suggest that???

Her response?? “I just can’t see why I’d tell you things like that.” Wow, how invalidating. 

I told Nmom I began working thru the pain of no relationship w Ndad 4 years ago, and feel little to no emotion about it now. She kept dropping in conversation that I’m “beginning healing”, like no, you have no idea where I’m at, and you can’t because you’re still making excuses for Ndad & can’t accept that I’m not a pliable teen/20-something anymore.

224,I feel so awful because of my narcissist dad.,DidYouWriteThis,0,1,1,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536119198.0,9d2rb1,"I am in the midst of begging my narcissist father for forgiveness so I can be sure he won’t take his anger out on my mom, my sister, or my pets. He told me that my presence at home will ruin his vacation from being a husband and father. I feel awful for wanting his validation and love, but I’m scared of him hating me. It seems like, since I stopped being an easily manipulated little kid, he’s completely lost interest in parenting or being nice. I just want things to be better. "
225,Bette Crawford was actually violent (tw: child abuse),MadHatter06,0,11,107,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1535997007.0,9cnkqz,"I’ve told before about how weird Bette Crawford was when it came to sex. At the same time, what she’d let us watch (old movies that didn’t exactly hide sex stuff) made it seem like she was okay with all that. Maybe it was just part of her crazy making, I don’t know. 

I added the tw as a just in case. This was the only time she actually got physically abusive with me. But unfortunately it wasn’t a surprise. I had realized years before this that she was always on the edge of abusive. I think the only thing that kept that from happening was that with our social circle, it wouldn’t have been easy to hide, since we were seeing people outside of family 3-4 times a week. She couldn’t have hid if we were bruised and battered.

This happened when I was 12. Now this was many moons ago, but you expect that by 12, a girl has at least a little knowledge of what sex between adults is. I had very vague understanding, since Bette did her best to completely shelter me and keep me ignorant and babied. A friend was over, and we were playing with Barbies. Yeah, I was probably close to outgrowing that, but this incident pushed that. We have Ken and Barbie living their lives, married, working, and all that Jazz. And so in this little story, Barbie and Ken come home, have dinner... and then its business time. Basically they had their clothes off and were in the bed. That’s it.

Bette comes busting into my room for no reason. Startles me so bad I literally jumped to my feet. She looks down, sees the dolls, and I watch her face. I know in that moment that I’m dead. She says something to me and my friend and leaves. My friend can’t understand why I’m shaking at this point, but I know that as soon as my friend is gone, I’m gonna get in so much trouble.

Sure enough, Bette waits. After my friend is gone, and after I’ve gotten ready for bed, she comes in and shuts the door. I didn’t realize the significance of that at the time, but now I know she didn’t want my dad or brother to hear any of this. They would have put a stop to her plan. She starts demanding to know WHY we were playing with our dolls that way, WHO taught me about that, and WHO had the idea to play that way?!? Again, I’m 12, with very vague knowledge, but I do know that married folks get in bed, get naked, and do... something. I seriously had no real knowledge, which is rather sad in itself.

So she grabs the dolls and basically wants me to reenact the entire play leading up to that. This was another one of her favorite tactics, demanding to know everything leading up to something and then exploding when you don’t remember every detail, declaring that it meant you were lying. No Bette, some people just don’t record the minutes of every interaction and action like it’s a business meeting. So I’m trying, but by this point I’m tired, I’m scared, and I’m trying to figure out what she wants from me and how much trouble I’m in. When I can’t give her detailed breakdowns, she grabs the Ken doll and throws it. At my face. From less than a foot away. Hits me square in the nose.

In that moment, I remember wishing so badly that she broke my nose. Why? Because I knew that otherwise, no one would believe that this happened and she would feign innocence. 

Bette demands again that I show her. When I can’t, she does it again. It happened FOUR times. She deliberately picked up a toy and threw it at the same spot on my face four times.

The next few days were a total mess. She was screwing with my head at that point. In front of other people she acted just fine, like nothing was wrong. Two nights later, the same thing happened. She comes in, shuts the door, and the interrogations begin again. The day after, everything was peachy.

After this, she “decided” that since I was old enough to know about sex, I was too old to play with barbies and ordered that I box them up. They stayed in those boxes till seven years later, when some younger relatives came over and began playing. Turning to me, Bette, in this light half laughing tone, asked me why ever did I stop playing with Barbies. I went stone cold and reminded her that she made me stop. She laughed, said “Oh yeah”, and walked away.

I tried for years to understand. Did she think I was being molested? Why was she so angry? But none of her questions were about if someone was harming me. No, she was asking about tv shows, about friends, about movies. She loved to sudden declare something was “inappropriate” and forbid it, keeping me from either fitting in with others my age or just making me seem weird and an outsider. She loved me being an outcast. I now understand she was looking to shut me off from more of the world. She wouldn’t have cared if I had been harmed, since she never cared when I said someone made me uncomfortable. When that happened I was mocked and basically told that I had no reason to feel that way and to suck it up. 

She never got physically violent with me again. But I always knew that she had the ability to do so.

TL:DR : Bette whapped me with a toy four times and then pretended like she was a doting mother."
226,Anybody else want to kill themselves?,Squidwardcrab223,0,21,10,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536147335.0,9d5muu,I’ve been depressed for too long all I do is sleep like my life is pointless at this point. Im 19 now and I’m tired of pretending like everything is perfect. My parents have gotten me to keep the act up for this long but I’m not doing it anymore. I’m tired and sad all the time. My parents fucked up my social skills and made it so they knew all my so called friends. They only let me make friends at stupid places like church where everybody is fake af. Every time anyone does something near me I flinch thinking I’m gonna get hit or something. My mom managed to get her family to hate her and my dad as well as my dads side of the family and always says that everyone is in the wrong accept her and him. I have no fingernails because of my anxiety like I have bitten them down so far it’s insane. I’ve become afraid to express my opinions mostly all the time due to my parents bullshit. They knew I was depressed all this time and didn’t care Like I’d literally sleep all day and wake up just to go back to sleep. I never had a normal childhood and now I can’t get it back. I never went to school because I was homeschooled and now I’m just an abnormal person overall but especially socially. Like my life was really over before it began. Nothing about me is normal and it never will be like I can’t even be a normal kid again I just wish i was never born then I wouldn’t have ever dealt with this. For the first time I actually got close to a knife and thought about ending it all. There’s nothing for me on this earth I’m just exhausted.

228,Religious parents - mostly Justnomom - are causing me to lose my mind (Long),mbb0020,0,20,10,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536148815.0,9d5tb9,"FTP, LTL, on mobile, etc. 

So we need some context to this story. Backstory first - I was raised in the Bible Belt. My family was “Christian” when I was little (0-10). We’d pray before meals half of the time and that was about it. I remember going to church once during that time though I did attend a Baptist pre-K.

My dad would listen to godsmack, Motley Crue, Seether, etc. My parents would go to parties, drank and had a good time. My maternal grandparents used to throw these huge parties for all the holidays where drinks were flowing, people were laughing, they were smoking, etc. You know, like most people live. They weren’t ever crazy about it... but they could have a good time.

About 12 years ago something happened - what it was, I have no idea. We suddenly all became VERY religious. Going to church every Sunday and Wednesday; we all got baptized; we were a part of small groups, etc. 

Then we moved to a new state. Stopped going to church and things were mostly back to normal. Granted my grandmother was going to theology school during that time (she now has a Doctorate of Divinity and thinks she knows everything about God.) This lasted about two years until we moved again. 

When we moved, we started going to church again. Every Sunday. Small groups on Wednesdays. Taking part in every little thing the church did. It has spiraled from there over the last 8 years.

Drinking is bad, staying out late is dangerous, shouldn’t go to bars/breweries, think I’m an alcoholic because I like a glass of red wine with my steak. 

Every. Single. Thing. Comes back to god. “It’s God’s will.” “God will take care of you.” “Put your faith in god.” “Praise the lord.” Every Facebook post. Nearly every phone call and text. 

Now these very Christian people, told me a few years ago that I was going to hell because I was moving in with my then boyfriend (now DH). We went LC for about 4 months after that, and it was hard on me. 

I guess it’s worth stating that during that time, I was religious, but not to their extent. 

I moved out at 17 and have been on my own since then. D(ear)Hand I graduated from college, moved away, have kickass jobs, and then got married. We are happy in our little bubble, make good money, and see eye to eye on everything. I have since left all religion behind. It’s taking me a few years because it’s been so ingrained in me, but the more I thought about it, the more ridiculous it seemed (no offense to anyone, you do you). 

My family has no idea. My family knows what I let them see. They are conservative, pro- life, slightly homophobic, right-wing, Donald Trump electing republicans. I’m the pro-choice, marry who you want, childfree, beer loving, bleeding heart liberal that’s essentially hiding in the closet to prevent confrontation with my family. Friends, MIL/FIL, coworkers all actually know who I am and what I believe in. 

Now on to why my mother is turning into JustNoMom. 

I have had some health issues this past year and have chronic pain. It’s life long. Medication to treat, but will never go away unless there’s a medical breakthrough. Mom also had chronic pain. You’d think she’d understand, right? 

Nope. She tells me “God has told me that you’re healed. You just need to accept his healing, and you won’t be in pain anymore.”

What. The. Fuck. This has gone on for months. I’ve told her it makes me feel like she’s being condescending and dismissive. She insists she doesn’t mean it that way - “just providing support.” My Dad is actually not this way at all. He’s tried to talk to her, but she just continues to do this. You would think as someone who has dealt with chronic pain for 12 years would understand it doesn’t just “go away.”

She has become insufferable to talk to. Any achievements of mine aren’t mine, it’s god. My pain though, is apparently my fault for not accepting “his healing.” 

I wish I knew what the catalyst was all of those years ago. Maybe then I’d understand more. The relationship with my mother is becoming toxic. I am hiding and lying about who I am in order to keep from hurting her and causing confrontation. Moving away was the best thing (second to marrying DH) that I ever did as it allowed me to find myself and what I actually believe and don’t believe. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m not ready to go NC and I’m especially not ready to tell her why I’m going NC, but that’s where this is heading. I love my mom, but she is slowly driving me insane and the added stress from keeping up fronts only exacerbates my condition. 

If you read all of this, thank you! Any advice on what to do, how to have an honest conversation, whether it actually is time to go LC/NC would be greatly appreciated. 

Also could totally use a name for my soon to be JustNoMom. 

P.S DH is on the same wavelength as I am and is supportive of whatever I want to do. FIL/MIL are also usually great and understanding.

229,I ranted about my mentally abusive mother around a week ago. Now her ignorant self wants to homeschool me? What should I do?,flocktothenews,0,4,7,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536100467.0,9d0fyx,"Let me preface this by saying that I have some form undiagnosed learning disorder, and that I struggle to pay attention in school constantly. It's extremely painful for me to even remotely pay attention for long periods of time (to the point were I'll start crying) so ever since third grade I've kind of just given up on good grades. I'm in highschool now and when I DO try my hardest to apply myself, it still fails. I failed 3 out of 6 classes last year but the school district let one of them slide (it was PE) because there's a lot of health problems in my family. My parents have hounded me about doing homework and asking questions but I just can't do it. I genuinely don't think I'll ever pass highschool, even if I do extremely well on state mandated tests and have a decent vocabulary for my age. Past teachers have said that I had the potential to do great in school, but that's more of what my parents wanted to hear and not what I'm actually capable of doing.
I would love to get help for it but my mom hates going to the doctor's, even if it's a medical emergency because ""they're paid to say stuff"". She's also antivax (my dad isn't, however), and the only reason why I'm fully vaccinated is the laws in my state surrounding them and school. She doesn't think I should have a therapist either because ""I should be able to tell her everything"". So seeking. Mental help is out of the question.
I overheard her talking not even an hour ago that she doesn't like the school officials in my district, and the quality of the schools have gone down since my dad graduated in 82. (I actually agree with her on this). 
She's right, I hate to admit. The school officials are clumsy and messed up my schedule THREE TIMES, a math teacher got fired for having breakdowns in her class and 70% of her students failed, the guidance counselors purposely pick out the students who do well on state tests to make our statistics look higher, and right now I have FOUR teachers that would rather give us packets and group projects than actually teaching us.
I'm four weeks into the school year. I'm falling all of my classes. I hate the school I go to for the life of me, but what really got to me is how she wanted to homeschool me.
Um, no. She didn't go even up to a 9th grade education and thinks vaccines legitimately cause autism. If she homeschools me I'll be more stressed out than I already am. 
I do want out of that atrocious school system though. Maybe there's some way I can convince her that online school is a better option? Help me reddit.

230,GROW THE F UP!!,daisybloom1991,0,44,204,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536071290.0,9cw3ps,"Long time lurker, first time poster. Also on mobile so please excuse the format.  

This story has to deal with MIL, SIL, and DD. 

Alittle back story- I have bipolar disorder and have been struggling with depression and manic episodes since I was a teenager but it’s been getting worse since DD was born 2 years ago. With that being said I’m checking myself into a partial hospitalization program today. I set up this appointment on Friday and MIL knew about it. 

I am a stay at home mom who uses MIL for childcare only when I have appointments and she is ok with this. I hate having her watch my daughter because she is to put it nicely, EVIL!!  Well anywho, MIL agreed to watch DD while I go to my intake appointment. 

This morning I text MIL to ask if she wanted to come to my house or if she wanted me to bring DD to her house. She says her house and I agree that’s fine, although I like DD to stay home.  (MIL is a hoarder and her house is busting at the seems with junk) 

About an hour later she calls me. SIL needs to go to the walk in clinic so she won’t be able to watch DD because she has to go with her. I’m thinking SIL broke a limb or something is terribly wrong. Nope, she had a cold sore in her nose. And MIL has to go with? Why WHO THE F KNOWS!!!

Now my SIL is damn near 30.... and she does not go to a single drs appointment without dear MIL.  Some appts I can understand, like for upcoming surgeries or what not. SIL is a healthy and functioning adult. I just don’t get why she has to have dear MIL go with to every. Single. Appointment. She lives with her boyfriend and clams she’s an independent women. 

Anyways back to the story; I kept my mouth shut because MIL is like i said a demon. I don’t want to start a war between the family because there is enough of those. With an hour before my appointment I was scrambling to find a sitter.  Thankfully my dad is on vacation and is willing to take DD for a few hours on a day he was supposed to go boating. 

Sorry for the rant, I am just fuming. This isn’t the first time this has happened either. When I did work MIL would call me 5 mins before she  as due to arrive to watch DD and say SIL needed this or that and she couldn’t watch DD. I have looked into daycares and nanny’s for the those wondering why I didn’t do that. I live in a very rural area with no in home daycares or nannies willing to travel to my small town for the amount I was able to afford.

231,Is my mom a narcissist? Im mentally exhausted and don't know if I'm crazy,amyeet,0,4,3,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536137040.0,9d4jtx,"My relationship with my mom has always been best described as walking on eggshells. It's only gotten worse since I'm going through my teenage phase, where I'm standing up for myself. Here's some things that have happened, that make me question whether she is a narcissist or not. Bear in mind she is a good mother, she cooks, cleans, looks after me when I'm sick, takes me to school, does the mom-things all moms do. I dont know if she's a narcissist if shes caring in that sense. Is she emotionally a narcissist? What is she? Aahhh. Anyways take a look.

* When I was really young (like 10-13) and we had problems, she'd smash her head against the wall crying and saying she doesn't want to live anymore. It really freaked me out
* Again when I was young and we'd fight, shed throw all my shit on the ground (clothes, toys). Then apologise later and say ""I didn't mean that""
* Always says ""you'll know once I'm dead"", ""you'll be happy once I'm dead"" ""you'll appreciate me once I'm dead"". I told her I do not want to hear her say things like that because they upset me, and she will laugh/smile and say ""but it's the truth"" and doesn't stop doing that.
* She used to say ""you know that I can die anytime, and I have a feeling very soon"" or ""my fortune teller says I'll die next year"" a lot, but she stopped ever since I started responding with ""me too. I could get hit by a car, age doesn't have anything to do with it.""
* Showed me her vagina once? She saw mine and then said something like, ""that's not how it's supposed to look like! whats wrong with it?"" and then showed me hers. Can't unsee that. Eugh
* We had a really bad fight. I started crying and asking why she was ""doing this to me"" and in response she just fucking laughed and smiled, and said some weird sadistic shit. I dont remember all the details but it was unsettling to say the least.
* Most fights end with me apologising.
* Her apologies dont feel genuine. Or even an act of passive aggression eg: ""Fine! I'm sorry, everything is my fault! It's all my fault! You're perfect and nothings wrong about you, it's all my fault"".
* Doesn't seem to respect my boundaries. I ask her as nicely as I can, if she can ""leave me alone for a few hours"" and explain I'm in a bad mood and need to be alone. She always bursts in after a while and asks what happened and whats wrong. I say I don't want to tell her but she insists and then after I tell her I feel like shit.
* When I say ""stop touching me"" (like when she pats my bum or strokes my thighs/legs) shes like ""I can do whatever I want, you are my child/you came from my womb"" and I feel really pissed off. She also used to wash my back and got offended when I didn't want her to see me naked anymore.
* Gets mad when I call her out on her hypocrisies and bullshit, but I only do that when I feel unfairly accused. Denies them or says ""why are you bringing up the past?"" ""why can't you let things go?"".
* From 12-15, my mom would sit me down when my dad wasn't home, and talk about what's wrong with dad. Like the time she thought he cheated on her with her friends, accusations of adultery, everything wrong with my dad, how he's like his own shitty father, how he's disgusting, how he only likes ""sex"", a lot of private stuff that messed up my dad and I's relationship. She always ended with ""oh but your dad loves you. You should still respect him"". Worst part is that she got mad when I told her ""stop telling me these things"" and ""go tell a therapist or your friends, not your child"". She continued to tell me until sometime when I was 16 because every time she tried to tell me I said ""no, don't want to hear. If you tell me I won't listen.""
* Her life lesson for me was ""never trust men"". ""Only your family will love you. No one else will truly love you as much as I do""
* I read somewhere that narcissist mothers are sexually competitive with their daughters? Dont know if this counts but she always tells me about how sexy she was when she was my age, how she was skinnier than me and had big tits, how shed have a ton of male attention. When someone says I'm pretty, my mom will say ""that's from my genes""
* Calls me chubby all the time
* I remember someone said to me ""oh you look so much more beautiful than either your mom or dad"" and my mom was visibly offended, and said ""oh well she has to get her beauty from her mom, or someone"". I think she feels insecure.
* She always puts down my dad's looks, says hes the ""least looking guy"" shes dated, and that she ""settled"" for him.
* She uses passive aggressiveness and silent treatment regularly, especially when she doesn't get her own way (even small things like not going to the restaurant she wants to go to, not drinking a glass of water etc)
* I went through a recent break up. Told her ""please don't mention his name"". She DOES. Whenever she does and I say ""I told you to stop"", she gets visibly upset.
* Never says thank you, excuse me, I love you. That's fine, but then she gets mad when I dont.
* Seems jealous when I get along with my dad. She left for a month to look after grandma (see she's not a bad person) and Dad and I spent a month together. Honestly, the most peaceful and emotionally stable month I'd had in a long time. When she came back and saw how well Dad and I were getting along, she got upset and awkward about it, and then said ""fine I'll LEAVE if you two get along with each other so well.""
* Always complains about me being an incapable child and how I don't do enough. But when I want independence, and start doing things for myself, she gets upset too. As though she doesn't want me to break the reliance on her. Id rather rely on myself but its so hard because she wont let me do shit for myself (eg complains about how I never cook. I cook myself dinner, she says it tastes meh and then insists she will make dinner next time. Doesn't seem to know what she wants??)
* Wont fight fairly. Talks over me. Doesn't really listen or understand, but gets upset when I wont confide in her.
* Looks wayyyy too into things. I told her ""thanks for lunch, it was delicious"" and she got mad at my tone of voice, saying i was being ""cold"".
* Says shit like ""sometimes you dont act like my daughter"" or ""i dont feel like you are my daughter anymore"" or ""im not your mother"" then later says ""haha sometimes I say things i dont mean"" but it hurts.
* When I do tell her about my problems, she says ""oh i get it"" and then goes on about some story that happened in her life. Doesn't really help.
* Everything I say or do around her, I worry about it sparking another argument.
* She complains about her life and acts like dad and I don't have problems. Always acts like the world revolves around her, she has the most difficult life, shes the only one who works and is tired, when in fact she works from home whilst dad is a tradie and goes out working all day, and im at school 6 hrs a day, getting ready for yr12 which is really important
* Fought with me the day before I had a MASSIVE test. She knew about that too.
* She treats me REAAALLY nicely sometimes, and then does a 180 and becomes cold and cruel
* Wants me to be better than other people. Doesn't want me to date anyone below my level (aka she doesnt want me to date a tafe student or tradie??)
* We got into a fight before a piano exam of mine, and when I came back and said ""i might have failed, dont feel confident"" she non-jokingly said ""good. i knew this would happen."" i ended up getting an A and felt really resentful of my mom.
* Seems like she cannot handle the TINIEST bit of criticism from ANYONE.

My dad and I feel the same way about mom: she is childish, immature, emotionally unstable and inconsiderate when it comes to other peoples emotions. We're so tired of it.

I think mom is trying to get better but its like there are two parts of her fighting. One part is horrible and the other wants to be a good mom. I'm so tired and terrified of the unpredictability

If you could tell me what you think she is... id really appreciate it.

And if you could tell me what I should do. She agreed on leaving time to time (to our holiday house) but often doesn't follow through until a masssiiive argument.

I agree dad and I can be more appreciative, but her constant complaining, nagging, criticisms, fighting make it difficult to express positive feelings.

Anyways. Please respond.. I cant let this go on. I have to focus on my studies, I have to get my life together, I've been turning to alcohol as a way to feel better but its self destructive and I'm trying to stop.

TDLR I love my mom but I can't stand her. Is she a narcissist?"
232,"MIL and abusive ex used to despise each other, now they’re besties",patheticandsad,0,15,40,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536101367.0,9d0k1k,"I recently left my abusive husband of 11 years.  I FINALLY reported the most recent incident to police and he’s since been charged with 3 counts of assault.   His mom had to bail him out and I imagine she was not happy about that.  

These two have always had a shit relationship. They were always nasty to each other.  Condescending , rude, backstabbing, grudge holding assholes.  He would complain to me that she treated him like garbage as a kid. his sister was the golden child and he was the black sheep.  

She once told him she couldn’t stand to look at his face because he reminded her of his father (who left her for another woman 20 years ago). 
I had to force my ex to visit her out of respect.   
She refused to help with our kids - my mom being the only one to offer babysitting or any support. 

Now that I’ve left, there’s a restraining order against him and we can not communicate other than through a third party. She’s taken this as a means to control the situation. She’s asked why I stayed if it was ‘that bad’ with a sarcastic smirk on her face.  She also basically prevented me from taking my things from OUR home - she stood over me while I leafed through my personal documents, stating I shouldn’t remove anything from the home “ under the circumstances “.  

I got so upset I just left without finishing - I threw my own clothes on the front lawn. Just to get the fuck out of there. Out of my OWN house that I’ve owned 5 years. I felt like a trespasser.  And the look she gave me when I was frantically trying to get my shit out as quickly as possible - is the same look he used to give me.  It’s a look that says “ you deserve this pain; I’m better than you”. It’s like there is nothing in there - no human emotion.  Two peas in a pod, yet they’ve spent most of their lives hating and resenting each other’s existence. 

I finally see it now - they are the exact same person.    Misery loves company, and they both love to be miserable!

233,How to help our niece have a normal childhood?,Explodingovary,0,1,6,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536094479.0,9czmjq,"So my soon to be SIL is fairly narcissistic. She’s gotten better over the years but would still probably consider her an nSIL. 

She has a 5yo daughter (E) who is a sweet, spunky, caring, sensitive little girl. Father is not in the picture after some custody issues (seriously a good thing, even with an nMom). My future MIL enables watches E a few days each week but largely doesn’t do much to curb nSIL’s behavior. 

My fiancé and I want to do what we can to help E have a good childhood despite the circumstances and try our best to confront nSIL when we can about N behaviors. But we also don’t want to push it too far and have her pull a NC (unlikely but still want to be safe). 

Any tips for how to help E deal with it all as she grows up? Things we can do to support her and show her that nSIL behavior isn’t normal? We’ve always reminded E that she can talk to us about anything and we are a safe place and we love her. 

Thanks for the help in advance "
234,[TW:All of the Above] Building a support system from nothing and Only people who experience this will understand why this is terrifying,TesseractToo,0,1,6,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536082065.0,9cxt1n," Hi, nice to meet you all I come from a small and insular (if you can call it that, I am the excluded black sheep that everyone else has permission to abuse) family. We were immigrants so there were no cousins, aunts/uncles, no grandparents, nothing like that.   


I just learned about Narcissism about a year ago when I was seeing a psychologist following losing everything when I moved halfway around the world to get married with my partner of 6 years cohabiting for 2 years. Due to various reasons, some I know and some I never will, he turned his back on me and iced me out as he was having an online affair and became cruel and violent and since I'd sold my home and sold or donated to charity everything that wasn't shipped (so pretty much everything) and re-homed my pets- I had nothing to go back to.   


I'd put everything into this promise that even if things didn't work out that he would always be there (which of course was said to me enough times over the years that I believed him and also of course was not true).   


I was really trying to go no contact with my NMom, who is extremely cruel in such a flippant dismissive way you can get whiplash trying to follow her cognitive dissonance. My stepdad is extremely codependent on her, but even he gets exhausted at her emotional gluttony and managing her outbursts and how she likes to abuse anyone she can get away with abusing (pretty much that means me and whatever poor person she has targeted at a customer service counter or hotel management. She can shout the paint off a wall I'm sure. She enjoys abusing these poor people too, it's like she enjoys finding some small flaw in something so that she can bring some front desk clerk to tears over some menial thing just so she can get a tiny discount - it's embarrassing and I of course empathise deeply with whomever she has targeted in her sights, but at least they get to never see her again and hopefully go home to a loving family and she will be a story and a bad memory.   


When my partner started to turn on me, my world flipped upside down and inside out. The trauma of the abuse put me into a deep depression where I was unable to cope and I ended up attempting sui in a manner that no one (including myself) believes I should have survived. I'm still furious that I did. My mom didn't attempt to contact me while I was in the hospital and claims I was refusing her calls (no I gave them her contact info- how would they have even known how to contact her if I hadn't given them her contact?) When I called my parents for help, my mom laughed at me as though losing my partner in a strange continent was a hilarious joke.   


I'd moved here for safety and belonging especially into a family- belonging and community something that was taken away from me in stages in Canada as I met with trauma after trauma and became disabled due to pain and was having trouble coping with the pain (thus becoming ""less fun"") and my friends abandoning me one by one. It was uncanny the way it seemed to happen in patterns and it always eluded me what the common denominator was.   A couple days ago I reconnected with my ex and we have cautiously been seeing if we can talk and I was told ""as soon as you were in the hospital, your mom wasted no time telling me your mom was saying your traumas were made up lies and she was happy to completely throw you under the bus"". Holy. Effing.   


  
Now it makes sense how any therapist or help where my mom got in the middle went so completely FUBAR. Now it makes sense how so much of my life went so completely FUBAR. Normally my PTSD and cPTSD and being punished for having normal emotions has caused me to have what they call ""a flattened affect"" (I don't emotions well especially in relation to the amount of trauma I've endured) but once that had some time to soak in I became so enraged and so furious I broke my personal no contact and had to find out. Of course she denied all of it and demanded to know who had told me this. As if it would have been hard for her to figure out, it's not like she knows any of my contacts except one or two.   


  
So following that major nervous breakdown from losing everything (and a major move while disabled), followed by trying to counterbalance a crumbling relationship that went from awesome to nightmare, the attempt, 18 months of homelessness n a strange place (where I was psychically and sexually assaulted during this time), being taken advantage of by many unscrupulous people who I thought I was making a proper deal with and they were being dishonest, reaching out to see if anyone would help, having many smaller nervous breakdowns like aftershocks following a major earthquake, not knowing what is real anymore, acquiring major anxiety disorders like social phobia and agoraphobia, I don't know what to do. I went to a trauma specialist and she taught me about the Nmother - golden child - scapegoat child dynamic - it was a revelation.   


I need to be around kindness and support, that is why I came here and I need it so much more now that I'm alone and afraid. I've never not kept pets before and I'm surprised how much even fish kept me grounded and on a schedule. I don't have any motivation for self care and it feels in a way like a form of self harm, just denying myself anything as if I need punishment for all of this.   


And now I find out my mom is much more sociopathic than I ever imagined... which is like trying to imagine infinity. She of course doesn't do boundaries. She behaves like a spoiled six year old. A couple of examples to set the scene, once when I was staying over at her house she was freaking out that I had the audacity to sleep in till 10:30 am and she barged in and started beating me with both arms while I was in bed. I asked her why she was hitting me, and she said ""I didn't"" and then ""it's in the past no use in mulling over it"" - that was less than two minutes ago! Suddenly it had never happened. And she would ""just drop by"" to my house and pick fights with me regarding my brother (I had to go no contact with him, he is the golden child (not in talent or success but in the way he is treated but he is extremely dangerous and killed two of my tame talking birds just to drill in the point he enjoys harming me)- I told her no abuse and no picking fights in my house, this won't happen under my roof so she went just outside the back door and stared shouting insults in so the whole neighbourhood could hear her. I mean she literally behaves like a bratty six year old. Why is this so hard.     


Where are good people. I'm quite housebound due to being lied to by the renters who know I have to use mobility assist but when I arrived with boxes I was on the 4th floor of a walkup not the first as they had told me. What a nightmare. I'm so afraid my legs will buckle on me from the nerve damage in my legs when I go down the stairs.  


So thanks for listening to me rant and I don't know how to build a support from scratch after being this badly shaken and am now dealing with the experience of running into extreme psychos over and over... I don't feel safe. Oh and this is the thing that is terrifying. One of the times she was talking to my ex, she offered to buy us a house if we moved to her city in the US. At first I was surprised, she doesn't gift me with anything unless someone who she really wants to gift would benefit and she can use it to corral me somehow. That house wouldn't have been a home, it would have been her Trojan effing horse to have licence to barge in at any time ""it's my house and I can do what I want"" and completely disrupt our lives. And my ex's sudden personality change? Turns out it was a brain tumour :( And I miss him like crazy- the kind loving version, not the paranoid critical cruel fighting version- and if I knew it had some physicality I would have been able to endure the 9+months crammed in a studio apartment with him going through his perceptions of my character with a lice comb (thank mom for feeding him those paranoid thoughts), but he got married to the person he was having an online affair with and doesn't even live here anymore and I'm stranded and terrified and my pain is out of control. And I feel like I'm being played by an insane puppet master and her flying monkeys.  


I don't know what to do. I'm sorry if this is confusing, I'm very confused. Thanks for reading all of this.

235,How do you handle knowing there's an 80-99% chance there's going to be a confrontation with your JNM?,second_glance,0,11,14,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536084714.0,9cy7u0,"Most of the time I feel like I don't belong here because my JN is my step mother, but I love reading your stories and try to apply the same concepts you use on your inlaws. 

I still attend family events knowing my JNSM will be there because I still very much want to be a part of my family. It seems as though if the event is small enough and she's comfortable with letting her mask slip, there without a doubt will be some form of confrontation. In my ideal world we can attend the same events without interacting and both enjoy our family. For some reason my presence brings out the absolute worst in her.

 This weird dynamic has been going on for well over a year. Sometimes she's okay with us being near eachother, she just ignores me or makes faces while I talk or rolls her eyes, but other times she tries to make other people believe I want to kick her out of her home and refuse to be places if she's there, to me she plays the victim hardcore and makes up lies before events, but then when we're around eachother she gets super aggressive. 

This last time was my own fault. She was pouting off by herself shaking her leg and head and I walked up to her and asked her to come hangout with the family. My intentions were to extend an olive branch and even though the group is small we can still be around others. 

Idk what I do that triggers her so bad, but when I'm not physically present she puts on a show (especially on facebook) like there is nothing going on between us. But behind the scenes she is bashing me and playing victim, it's gotten so bad one of my sisters kids, I repeat, kids, wrote her a letter about her behaviors including how she bad mouths me. 

So I know that this cycle is just life for now until either she accepts that we can both enjoy our family or I stop attending small events with her present (which causes even more drama with others). 

So JNMil, any and all advice is greatly appreciated. How do you handle going into an event that you know will more than likely involve a confrontation or drama? Most of the time I break out in hives from the stress of it. "
236,HTF do I negotiate the holidays with JNMIL...,TenaciousTapir,0,27,28,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536087679.0,9cyn89,"My (24F) SO (29M) and I have been dating for a year and a half and living together for just over a year now. We’re not in a rush to get married but know we will someday. 

My SO and I are generally on the same page when it comes to our families. Mine is great to be around and we spent 10 days last Christmas break living at my parents and would do it again no problem. His family is boring, we don’t share any common interests with them (and our attempts to do things we think his mom would enjoy usually fall flat/are under appreciated), they are not warm or expressive and conversations rarely go beyond small talk. 

So last year, we were living an airplane ride away and my sister and mom came to visit us for thanksgiving and we had a fantastic time. For Christmas break, we drove 14hrs home (our families live 45 miles apart), stayed 10ish nights with my family and 3 days total but only 1 night with his. We spent Christmas Eve and morning with his family and headed over to my family’s around 1pm to do Christmas “morning” with them and then dinner. We enjoy the time with my family much more and both feel like we are doing what we’re obligated to do around his fam. I encouraged him to plan a few more nights we could spend at his parents so they didn’t feel like we were spending all our time at my fam’s but he didn’t, which was fine until when we came over for a day before we were making the long drive back, JNMIL made a comment about how we didn’t split time very equally. Gahhhh! SO did nothing to make it clear that that wasn’t my fault, but I think he knows to next time. 

Anyways, that brings me to the advice part. We’ve recently started talking about how we’re going to break up the holidays this year. SO and I now live 2-3 hr drive away from our parents and my sister and some of my extended fam live in the same city we’re in. We will likely have thanksgiving with my family, but I think JNMIL will be offended by this because it’s my BILs year to be at her place with his wife + daughters. 
I have no idea what we’re doing about Christmas this year yet. We just have so much more fun with my family. 

I’m just looking for stories and advice from people who split holidays (50/50 or a less even split) and how to do this without pissing off in laws who refuse to talk about what they want and prefer to be passive aggressive. "

Backstory, my nmom has always been mentally and verbally abusive to my sister, my dad, and me. I’ve had an extremely rough child hood because of my parents unhealthy marriage and the abuse that I actually got shingles at the age of 14 from stress. I’m 22F in college a state over and I’ve been going to a school therapist who told me that from what I’ve said about my mom, it sounds like she suffers from NPD and borderline personality disorder. It feels like my mom has been sabotaging my life because she’s either jealous or she thinks I’m not capable of making decisions on my own. 

My boyfriend and I went home for the weekend, my nmom had a lot of plans and my dad went hunting so my bf and I were just hanging out and seeing some friends. The last day comes around (this always happens when I come home) and I’m packing my things and my bf is in the car ready to go. My mom texts me “come down stairs, we need to talk”. Long story short they sit me down and and start bashing me. My nmom says that I dress so slutty when her friends see me around town they tell her that what I’m wearing isn’t flattering on me. Then they get into my relationship with my bf and his family and how I spend much more time with his family (shocker) then I do with mine. And that since my bf comes from a very wealthy family that I can’t trust him and that he’s going to marry me, kick me to the curb, and leave me with nothing. The whole thing ended with my dad and mom getting up in my face like they were about to beat me, and my dad calling me a “fucking cunt” and telling me to leave. 

The tricky part to all this is that my parents hold finances over my head so they can always be in control. They pay for my car, my school, my phone, literally everything and I have no money saved up so I can’t run away. My bf’s family knows mine is bat shit crazy and they told me if things ever get bad that they will pay for my school, car, and whatever else because they love me. But I can’t do that. I already feel like a burden to my own family and I couldn’t handle being a burden to another. I’m just so sick of them sitting me down and telling me everything they hate about me. I’ve been suicidal since I was 15 which they thought was funny. Both my parents have told me to do it. They spread lies about me to their friends, telling everyone I’m a drug addict for smoking weed (i haven’t smoked in over 6 months) and my mom even said to my dad “I hope she gets addicted to crack so you can finally see she’s a drug addict”. I get so angry that I will never have a normal life or family. And more that I will never have parents who can just accept me and be happy for me. 

Sorry for the long post, if anyone has any advice or encouraging words I would love to hear them. Thanks. "

240,"Introducing Hagda, or, Be Gentle with the Piñata",LikeItSounds,0,35,338,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536024509.0,9cr79b,"Hi there! I'm really glad I found this forum. This is my first post.

I have a jnmil. She is the worst. Right now I'm calling her Hagda, bc it works w/her name and she's a total hag, but I'm open to suggestions if we find something better. 

I'm sure at some point I'll be able to regale everyone with lots of flashback stories about Hagda, but today I'm going to introduce us with a story about YS's bday party. Also I have a serious case of sailor mouth, so, there's that.
The YS-bday-specific drama started six weeks ago, which isn't unusual for Hagda. Every year she has somewhere better to be than her 2nd gson's bday party, and every year I say in somewhat nicer terms, ""Go to your fucking lake house if that's really where you need to be while everyone else in your gene pool plus spouses is busy enjoying chocolate cake and not being an asshole."" Yeah, I know--YS's bday is always Labor Day weekend, but Hagda never misses OS's Memorial Day weekend bday, plus she's spent the last ten years boo-hooing out her vagina bc YS wasn't a girl, so she can eat a bag of dicks--I'm not accommodating her bullshit Labor Day weekend lake house desires. 

The story of what she had planned for this weekend instead of being a not-shitty grandmother deserves its own post, so I'll just say that DH put things to rights, secured Hagda's presence at the party (bc her not coming wouldn't be an option, we would have to reschedule hahahahaibustedasphincter), and we enjoyed about five weeks of relative peace and quiet, which came to a screeching but predictable halt about a week before the party.

There was lots of fuckery during this week, the prizewinner involving a piñata taller than YS himself which I feel she bought so as to be the center of attention at my mom's house (we did two parties bc my mom is in the advanced stages of cardiomyopathy, her heart functions at less than 20%, she tires easily, and my niece is also turning 1 so my sis and I decided to combine and take the party to mom, and Hagda insisted we take this gigantic piece of crepe-paper fuck-you trash to my mom's. We didn't.). There's plenty backstory about Hagda needing to be Important and Revered At a Gathering, and the gift of a large Pikachu piñata was suspicious in the extreme (her gifts are often Trojan Horses--stuffed to the gills with hidden agendas and self-serving motives).

Then there was today.

At our house today, there were thirteen adults, one teenager, one ten-year-old, two toddlers, and an infant. Hagda displayed less self-control than either one of the toddlers. That is not an exaggeration. During the three-hour affair, I did not once hear anyone call the toddlers down for the following: yelling; interrupting; shout-talking; being rude; meddling; ignoring repeated requests/commands to stop doing something; not keeping hands to self; taking something away from another kid and breaking it. I heard multiple people getting after Hagda for all these things at least once, and also witnessed each one of them myself. It is so very sad when a grown-ass woman does not have the self-control of a two year old.

The crowning moment was when the kids were outside for piñata time, a second small one she bought just for this party. She's micromanaging every aspect: where the kids should stand, who should go in what order, why the younger toddler should get over it and hit the piñata even though he didn't want to, blindfold--no wait, no blindfold--oh do you have the blindfold I told you to get? She's pissing off people left and right; the mom of the scared toddler is speechless with anger, DH is telling her to get her shit under control, no one is having fun. She's berating YS bc he's hitting his own piñata too hard, but while she's ranting about him being ""gentle with the piñata,"" she yanks the rope so hard that the piñata goes flying up, hits the wooden beam it was hanging from, detaches from the rope and falls to the ground. So YS sees his opportunity and starts whacking the piñata while it's laying there, everyone is cheering, finally we're doing what you're supposed to do with a fucking piñata, and that's when Hagda charges right in as YS is swinging the huge wooden sword we were using for a stick, pushes him aside, grabs the piñata, tears it open with her bare hands, and spills the candy all over the ground. SHE COULDN'T EVEN LET A TEN-YEAR-OLD BREAK A FUCKING PINATA HIMSELF. No. SHE had to do it. Everyone was aghast. The kids had to be encouraged to go pick up the candy bc no one knew what the hell was going on.

And that is my jnmil. Hagda. You haven't heard the last of her, llamas and bastards.

241,"I called my Dad for insurance purposes, and used nmom a name and not “mom”",ambann15,0,3,2,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536121347.0,9d2zfz,"He answered all my questions that I needed then asked what’s going on with my relationship with “your mom” he said you used her name, and I said well you probably know why. He said “well yeah it’s why we divorced. So it’s a personality difference that’s all you have to say. But she’s your Mom and you have to remember that.” I just said I don’t know how to healthily have boundaries with either of my sisters or her yet so I’m no contact. His moms a narcissist. He was the golden child, and I think maybe that mindset derived from there. 

He was always painted up as a bad guy by my Nmom, don’t get me wrong they both equally made their mistakes, but he didn’t deserve the amount of hatred spewed at him. We just followed along. Maybe over the years his empathy for her has changed. Or maybe it’s the same case as my GC older sis who said she couldn’t remember how bad nmom was because she hadn’t lived with her in so long.

Either way, it has filled me with guilt and has made me question no contact. But then flashes of my treatment call back. Things I have cut friends off for in the past. Maybe I’m too sensitive, but maybe I’m just done putting up with stuff. I don’t know. Just wanted to talk to someone about this."
242,My Mom threw away my picture.,HopefullyGinger,0,5,18,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536077152.0,9cx0cm,"I have a ton of posters from when I was a kid because I was only allowed to put things on the wall if my mom did it for me. Like I think I can handle a pushpin but whatever. Still there were plenty of things on my wall even when I moved out including a poster size coloring picture of a horse that I had diligently colored for my Great-Grandmother. I had even written on it {Dear Granny I love you double. Love [me]}. That coloring page stayed on my wall from the time she died when I was maybe 10 or 11 til just recently when my Mom took everything off my walls to try and empty out my room because my Dad has turned it into his ‘workshop’ (No never mind the two sheds full of junk in the backyard. He also needs my childhood bedroom.) She has so many paintings and posters rolled up but when I looked through them, that coloring picture wasn’t there. I asked her about it and she said, “It may have gotten thrown away. I didn’t realize it was so important.”

Bitch

Really you didn’t think this picture that’s been on my wall for almost twenty years was important? I almost started crying about it until she said, “I’m sorry I’m such a terrible mother.”

That stopped me because of course I’m not allowed to have feelings in their house. Can’t feel sorry, sad, sick, sore, nothing. So now I just desperately look for it every time I’m at their house but I think it’s a lost cause. She threw it away. I’m not sentimental about almost anything except for things I created for relatives that are gone now, or things they may have given me. I remember being so proud of myself for coloring that big picture and staying in the lines and following the pattern so that the right things were colored the right color. I remember being excited when they put it up in her room at the nursing home. I remember getting it back when she died and putting it on the wall right by my door so that I could remember those feelings when I saw it. 

But no, you’re right it was just a coloring page...why would that matter? Oh btw I saved all these Tiger Beat posters of celebrities for you..."
243,Still coming to terms with the realisation my family is toxic,stagnantriver35,0,2,10,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536075375.0,9cwpy5,"I still feel even as I write this that I'm deluded. That I really am a bad person as I've been made to believe and that I've fabricated this whole thing in my head that my parents are narcissistic or at least possess some of the traits.

And yet I can't ignore certain things anymore. I can't ignore how their behaviour matches the traits. How I identify and feel the pain of people in similar situations. I keep rationalising what's happened because it seems too awful, too sick to believe this happened and is still happening. Its like I've found out a dirty little secret. That the people that are meant to love me want to hurt me. That they would take advantage of my nature. 

For years my friends have hated my parents from what I tell them, but I just brushed it off and in my head thought no I deserve this, my friends are just too soft, parents should be hard on their kids and I obviously thought ""of course my friends are going to side with me my version of events could be bias and also they want to make me feel validated"". I was told by my parents that ""Mary's parents think the sun shines out her ass"" whenever they just loved their kid normally. My version of what is normal is skewed. I believed my parents telling me I was all these negative words. If it weren't for my best friend I doubt I'd have realised. She is so bitter towards them for how I've been treated. Whenever she comes to my house my dad acts so fake and weird and she feels uncomfortable because she knows what he's really like. Like I deserve to be slapped, hit, emotionally abused, called stupid most days despite excelling academically, ganged up on, called fat since age 10 when I was not, being chased up the stairs running from someone who's supposedly my dad who's screaming at me ,""IM GOING TO KILL YOU""., told my nose is warped, that I'm socially awkward, will never find a husband, compared to my prettier and more socially conforming friends. grounded for eating a chocolate bar, talked about critically as if I'm not in the room, humiliated in front of my friends/boyfriend, shouted at for other siblings behaviour, my dad walking into my room despite me saying ""I'm getting changed"", being banned from using the computer when I need to do schoolwork, told that I'm such an expense as a child and made to feel guilty. 

I can't stop crying realising the reality of it all. I always wondered what was so wrong with me, what I did to anger and upset them so much. A lifetime of indignant injustice is threatening to overwhelm me. Any advice on where to go from here would be appreciated. One reason I feel like this has happened as the youngest of 4 children is my relaxed nature allows people to walk all over me. I never respond to insults because it seems useless to but I'm now wondering if this has enabled the abusers behaviour. I don't want to turn into them by acting like them."
244,"Weird, Bitchy & Hurtful in Tinder? I hardly knew 'er!",oliverjbrown,0,8,47,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536129064.0,9d3s4q,"WB&H went on an extended leave from work after her hospital stint that eventually morphed into permanently leaving the position. Suddenly, she wasn't working, she found herself with a lot of time on her hands. Middle Sister introduced her to the exciting world of Tinder and online dating, and when she told me that, I could only sigh.  Nothing good was going to come from this. Nothing. 

One beautiful spring day in April, I was hanging out in my apartment with BFF, trying to distract him. That very morning, he took his sweet lab in for surgery to essentially rebuild her knee. The surgery itself was routine, but of course he was tied up in knots over all the potential things that could go wrong. In situations like this, the best thing to do is cook good food and drink some cheap wine and try to get through the day and night until it was time to pick her up. 

He's prepping the meat in the kitchen when I hear it. A tap-tap-tapping on my chamber door. 

""Who is that?"" BFF asked. 

""I don't know. Nobody told me they were coming by today."" 

""It better not be your mother."" 

But of course it was my mother. With all of the newfound time on her hands, she was perfecting the art of the random-unannounced-drop-by visit. She knew I worked from home, so she also figured out if she timed it correctly, she would absolutely have me cornered.

She came bearing gifts. She took a plastic planter, loaded it down with rocks, filled the rest with soil and weeds from her garden. Not actual plants, but some weeds. She was so excited about the gift that she immediately dragged me out to my balcony and moved all my actual plants around in order to best display the weeds from her yard. 

She also had some chocolate bars and some nasty sugar cookies. She informed BFF that she ""always had to bring food for my naughty girl or else she won't talk to me.""  None of that was true, and I had already informed her that I was starting a diet and did not eat sugar anymore. She argued with me that I HAD to accept the candy and insisted on leaving it on my desk. 
Only after that did she fill me in to the reason why she was in town. 

""I met a boy! A cute boy!"" She was 54 at this time, and she never told me about successful men, it was always about some cute boy.  She pulls up his Tindr profile and I see he's within a mile of my place, in the neighborhood dominated by college students. He was also about 10 years younger than me. 

But hey, if he's into it, more power to her.  

""How long have you been chatting with him?"" 

""Oh, since last week."" 

Something about her tone is already giving me a funny feeling. ""So are you meeting him somewhere for drinks or something?"" 

""No, I'm going to find his house."" 

Find. His. House? 

""Mom, is he expecting you?"" 

""Well, we don't have plans. I asked him last night if he wanted to meet up, and he said yes, but when I asked him about today, he didn't respond."" 

""And you drove 40 miles to City anyway?"" 

She is immediately on the defensive, claiming that he didn't say NOT to randomly show up at his house. She said she had his address and asked me to locate in google maps. As I expected, he was within about a mile of me, and I was pretty eager to have her out of my house, so I gave her the driving instructions and sent her on her way. 

BFF asked me if she was really gone or if she was coming back. I was so hopeful that this whole situation was not about to blow up in her face and send a shockwave through my quiet day that I told him not to worry, she was gone to meet up with her date. 

She was back within 15 minutes. 

As soon as I opened my door, I could tell she was upset. She immediately launched into the story of exactly what happened and I rushed to stop her. BFF was still in my kitchen cooking, and I was trying to help her save face a little. I grabbed my dog and his leash and told her, ""Let's go for a walk"" but WB&H did NOT want to go for a walk. She wanted to talk about what just happened to her Right. Now. 

Apparently, she found his apartment without too much trouble. He answered the door when she knocked, and naturally, was surprised to see her. Even so, he invites her in and they start to walk upstairs to his room. 

Besides bugging me and trolling for dick on Tinder, WB&H also used her newfound time to make ""art."" What she did for this art was take pictures off people's Facebook profiles and then used an app on her phone to scribble all over them. I wish I had one of these masterpieces to share with you today, but imagine the unfettered finger-painting of an unhinged 5-year-old. If this sounds creepy it's because it was creepy. 

While she was chatting with this dude (and apparently stalking him) she tracked down his Facebook, downloaded some profile pics, and turned them into WB&H Originals.  Of course, she loses no time in showing him. In fact, she breaks out her phone on the way up to his bedroom. 

Shockingly, this does not make his dick hard. He tells her, ""You know, I'm no longer feeling it. I think you should go."" 

It's at this point in her story that I finally drag her out of the apartment so BFF can cook without puking all over our food. 

WB&H is FURIOUS at this 22 year old man who didn't want to know her in the biblical sense. Absolutely furious. 

""He thinks he's going to fuck me and he can't even take the time to talk to me?! Who the fuck is he?!"" 

Um, he's some random college student who never invited you to his house?  

The rest of that particular conversation is a blur these days, thank god for small favors. She went on a long rant about ALL of her attempts and failures with Tinder dating. Now, I have a certain amount of empathy for her. God knows I've had my own share of awkward attempts and even hurt feelings, and of course, I would love for her to find somebody to focus her time and attention on. 

But she was NOT open to any suggestions. She regularly invited strangers to her home where she went to great lengths to cook dinner and then was shocked that she was stood up. Or, they didn't stand her up, they actually showed up for dinner, and then had the audacity to not want to have sex with her! Of course, sometimes she did get laid, but then they didn't want to come back a 2nd time. How could she be treated SO POORLY? Why couldn't all these strange men trolling for older, desperate women on Tinder treat her with some respect?! 

All my suggestions for how to improve the situation (ie, don't surprise people in their own homes, don't invite strangers to your house, don't give ANYBODY your credit card information for any reason--yes that needed to be said) were met with utter disdain and explanations for why making these changes would NEVER work. Why what she is doing makes the MOST amount of sense for what she wanted to accomplish. 

Instead of listening to me, she cycled back to anger that he was SO disrespectful of her art. 

I'm actually able to get her to leave soon after that by insisting that I had to work and BFF had to go to the vet's office, and nobody had time to talk to her anymore. I hoped that would be the end of the story, but of course, it wasn't. 

A few days later, she calls to tell me her juicy new information. Through the book of faces, she found out that the college student she was stalking actually went on a date with another girl. Another girl she recognized as a friend of my sister's from college. 

""And she's a big girl! A really big girl. I guess he likes his girls fat. Well, I've never been rejected for not being fat enough. But I guess there's always going to be weirdos who like the big girls."" 

She's never been fat, but at the time, I weighed about 200 pounds more than she did.  I've lost 100 pounds since then--not to mention that 120 pounds of crazy bitch I'm no longer carrying with me--but it has only recently occurred to me that maybe, just maybe, I struggled with weight my whole life because the woman in charge of my care and feeding wanted to be sure I was no direct competition to her.

245,"MIL threatened grandparents rights, earned immediate NC",sequinsandpolkadots,0,327,2630,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536076939.0,9cwz36,"Longtime lurker, first time poster. (Yay?) 

DH and I have been married for almost six years, and MIL has been an issue since exactly two weeks before our wedding. Once she realized that we were definitely getting married, it's like a switch flipped. She has constantly disrespected our boundaries, acted like she's a perpetual victim, feels entitled to do whatever she wants, and treats us like crap. She has also made it clear that she believes I married DH for his money, even though I also work full-time. 

For six years, we've gone through these cycles with MIL where she attempts (pretends?) to behave for six to nine months. Then, she doesn't get her way regarding something trivial and has a full-on tantrum that involves her not speaking to us for about three months. Once she's ready to speak to us again, she and FIL start trying to guilt trip DH. The phone calls start. The passive-aggressive love-your-mother Facebook memes appear. That sort of thing. 

After the most recent cycle, DH and I agreed that we couldn't allow this continue, mostly for the sake of LO but also for our own sanity. I was ready to go NC immediately and be done with it. He wanted to have a Come-To-Jesus meeting to try to ""fix"" everything and see if we could work things out with MIL and FIL. Since this was very important to DH, I agreed but only if we didn't bring LO since I knew the situation had the potential to be volatile. 

It went very well, obviously - Sorry for spoiling the entire post in my title. I could write an entire post about our lovely conversation with them. So much WTF. (MIL believes that every thought that goes through her head and every word that comes out of her mouth is THE TRUTH. FIL enables, enables, enables.) The highlight was when she threated grandparents rights 10 minutes into the meeting. DH and I agreed going into the meeting that any threat of grandparents rights was an immediate NC. As soon as the threat was made, we ended the meeting and left. We are now NC with no potential for reconciliation. 

(Side note: Grandparents rights are non-existent in our state if the child's parents are married, not unfit parents and in agreement regarding not allowing their child to have a relationship with the grandparents. Grandparents rights only come into play if the parents are divorced/a parent dies or disappears, and even then, there are stipulations. However, MIL threated legal action involving our child, so we are taking this very seriously. Also, this doesn't mean they won't be able to find some attorney to take their money to attempt to make a case against us.) 

A nom for your llamas: This particular tantrum was caused when MIL posted a picture of LO on FB after explicitly being told not to post pictures of LO on FB, period. She stopped speaking to us because I had the audacity to call her out on FB. (I also reported the picture to Facebook.) During our meeting, she attempted to scold me for not calling her privately to ask her to remove the picture. I told her if someone disrespected a rule regarding MY child, I would call them out any way I pleased. (Direct quote from MIL: ""What's so special about your baby that his picture can't be on Facebook?"") She also had the gall to complain that she doesn't have any updated pictures of LO because DH and I haven't sent her any in three months. Not surprisingly, this isn't the first issue we've had with MIL and FB.

At this point, we have done/are doing the following:
1) got a call into the attorney to see if we need to take any action right now
2) blocked MIL/FIL on social media
3) blocked MIL/FIL phone numbers
4) installed a Ring doorbell
5) will be purchasing a few video surveillance cameras for our home
6) informed my parents who watch LO a few days/week so they are on alert
7) house is clean (and tends to stay that way, thanks to DH), pantry and refrigerator are stocked, and have started fully baby-proofing in the event of a surprise CPS visit.

Is there anything else you'd recommend doing? How over-the-top should we go with the babyproofing? (LO is crawling and pulls up on things, but he's supervised all of the time. At this point, we have cabinets with any cleaning chemicals locked down and outlets covered.) 

Anything we're not thinking of that we should be? 

Edited to add: I'm completely overwhelmed by all of the helpful advice and support I've gotten from this thread. THANK YOU! I appreciate everyone taking the time to respond. "

1) talked none stop about his friend's girlfriends drama between parents and cousins of people I've never met, will never meet, and not related to for probably 2 hours hours non-stop over lunch. Not like I hadn't seen him in 3 years or have interesting stories myself from living abroad..... Never got a word in.



2) Made fun of me when I yawned (baby voice d'aww somewons tired..) Me: ya I had a 14 hour flight and I'm still jet lagged. Not to mention I just had surgery yesterday. Him: sounds like someone's a bragger now! Me: no, you don't get to make fun of me then when I explain myself say I'm bragging... 


3) complaining that I never call... I told him to get a webcam and setup Skype 3 years ago. His excuse.. He needs help because he couldn't figure It out. (I bet he didn't even try!!!!!) You had 3 years... Surely you could have figured it out or asked someone.. But yes, it's my fault I didn't fly home to set up Skype for you.



4) parents divorced. Spent first day back having surgery and at my moms place. I had ZERO plans with him that day and that was on purpose. He sent an email saying if I didn't reply in 10 minutes he was gonna come over to my mother's house... Which we were having a big family meal with my brothers and sisters that flew in from around the world on that day. No, he wasn't invited or even knew about it. Just has no boundaries.



Said he was gonna show up at my workplace where I'm working abroad. Thank GOD he has  felony and the country I'm living in doesn't allow foreign felons in or he probably literally would. No boundaries!! 


Sorry for this rant. I've been living mentally free for 3 years and wasn't prepared for this on my arrival home."

_______________________________________________________

**For those who don't know, my mother is a sociopath.** Yes, she was diagnosed, and I will probably bring myself to write about in the future. She's not your average selfish narc, there is something truly evil and cruel in that empty void, a void that she filled with my screams and tears. She was never phased by the idea of killing me or harming me beyond recognition and probably would have if it wouldn't get her ""toys"" taken away, she didn't have empathy or guilt, she just didn't want to be caught and prevented from doing whatever she wanted.

In the beginning, she was sloppy, mimicking emotion posed more of a challenge and she was slower to figure out what was expected and how to respond. As a result, she had more slip-ups and people ""wised up"" a lot faster. Most people would begin to realise something was ""wrong"" pretty soon after meeting, she never quite ""sat right"", breaching the uncanny valley, and left a sickly feeling in the pit of your stomach; her face would move but her eyes were dark windows into something so sinister and silent it made you want to scream and you couldn't say why. The smart ones left within a week or two, but she honed her craft over the years.

She realised that ""normal people"", even if they didn't want to know or do anything about it, would get suspicious and eventually question things. All the lies, manipulation and isolation in the world can't stop gossip. So she changed her focus to people whose capacity were reduced. It started with churches, they were already so fervent and gullible in her mind, if they could reject reality for this imaginary group experience with God, surely they would accept her and ignore how fucked up she was. **And the scary part was, she was right.** 

All she had to do was be a ""poor Christian woman seeking God and salvation"", and they would forgive her of anything and everything, embracing her as she used them as pawns in her game and provided a perfect cover for abuse. This later escalated into more outlandish and cult-like religious groups that included writhing around on the floor during prayer and speaking in tongues. To an outsider, they looked crazy, so they couldn't question her without taking scrutiny themselves. This trend continued as it opened a new avenue: People in need of help. Drug addicts and mentally unwell people cycled through her life, incapacitated by illegal substances that she continued to supply to lure them in and keep them around. In an altered state, they barely had the senses to function, let alone resist and it took longer for them to realise they needed to get out. Eventually, they cycled through her life as transient nobodies, many of whom were a risk to my sibling and I, trying to physically/sexually assault us and being abusive in many ways; but to us, no one could be as scary or damaging as our mother. 

She also weaponised sex with these addicts to emotionally abuse, using it to break my sibling mentally and destroy any comfort and stability they thought they had. All my life I became a meat-shield and tried to protect them, but there was only so much I could do, and even holding my hands over their ears as tears streamed down their face was futile against the fake and exaggerated noises coming from the bedroom designed to break them. I wasn't bothered by it, but the image of that scared and broken child is burned into my heart and fills me with angry tears every time.

From the outside, she came off as charitable and kind, helping desperate people. But in reality, she took advantage of their vices, vulnerability and kindness to serve her own purposes. 

**Those who got away have no clue how lucky they are, I'm sure they saw glimpses that scared them enough to save themselves... If they only knew how bad it could've turned out for them.**

**TL;DR:** *My mother is a crazy sociopath that covered her tracks by hiding amongst religious zealots and drug addicts, exposing me to some serious creeps and dangerous people, and used them to torture my sibling.*

_______________________________________________________


**For reference:** I have severe CPTSD due to abuse and neglect, this is a journey for me and I am still learning how to talk about it. My mother is a sociopath and a real risk, she has stalked and attempted to kidnap me multiple times, do not ask for personal info.

248,PlantageNOT shall not pass!,NotFuckingWarren,0,42,140,False,JUSTNOMIL,"Ka is a motherfucking wheel, bitch.",1536122796.0,9d34z9,"(Best Robin Williams voice) Gooood Eveennning Llamas!  For your reading pleasure today, I'm gonna tell you all about how PlantageNOT pulled more nasty shit, plus tried scam us not once, but twice in about 6 months or so.  Standard disclaimers apply.   See BB for the shitshow.  We are NC and loving it.  This is LONG.  

TW:  MENTION OF SELF HARM ON THE PART OF A FAMILY MEMBER.  Back out if you need to.  It's a short mention with no gory details, and FIL is ok now as far as I know.

When we last left off, DD was evicted from my womb, and PlantageNOT behaved herself until the last second, until SURPRISE!  Not so much.  

So, we had been doing the new parent thing (no sleep, boobs don't wanna cooperate, poop explosions, you know how it works) and we were fucking TIRED.  In the meantime, my immune system decided to try to kill me and I got dx'd with the first of 3 autoimmune diseases.  This lead to flares, massive weight loss, bad shit...all by the time DD was 6 months old.  It was a struggle,  to say the least.

During all this, the War had continued.  Holidays were fought over, and PlantageNOT brought in a couple of FM in the form of DH's cousins.  You see, FIL decided to have his turn at going sideways.  He went on a hunger strike and started sitting in parking lots being sad and weird.  Eventually he wrapped his deceased mom's truck around a tree and ended up in the hospital.  We go down there and stop at GGMIL's house for a diaper change and to find out what's up.

Of course, we run into PlantageNOT,  because she wants to see DD....but she can't just stop there.  She has to comment that it's too bad he didn't die so he can burn in hell with his mother.  In front of DH, Sibling, and SSO.

Ok, so we are gonna go fucking Heart of Darkness up in this piece.  Gotcha.

Now, I had hit my limit with this shit.  I had had no sleep, my boobs didn't work (and this was when breast is best was a huge deal and you got shamed for not breastfeeding no matter the reason), I was SICK, and now this bitch has to start running her fucking mouth? 

I dropped her with my best Roland Deschain stare, and reminded her that her kids were standing a few feet away and she needed to watch her fucking mouth.  

And in that moment, ya'll, I made an enemy.  I saw that shit happen and all I could think was.... You know what?  Bring it.  You were my enemy from the second DH told me what you were about, you just didn't know it. Ka is a motherfucking wheel, bitch.  This was never about your side or FIL's.  I am Team DH and DD.  You are only seeing us at all because DH is working through a process, and you are making it easier for him to bounce every time you open your damn face hole.

Anyway, FIL was ok physically but we were unsure what was up mentally.  I mean, sure you gotta be messed up to do what he did but there was a scent of bullshit there too.  He acted like he suddenly couldn't function, but when he went to stay with his sister she said it was more like he wanted people to wait on him.  So he got asked to leave, and he started up again.

That's when I started getting fb messages from the cousins on PlantageNOT's side.  See, DH refuses to have the book of faces.  They all have his contact info.  But instead, they message me...but address him like it's his.  I tell them sorry, this is my account not DH.  You need to email or call him.  

They message back...talking to him!  

I try again.  Hey dumbass, not his secretary.  He's not reading these.  Email or call him.

Same deal.  It's like I don't exist.  Which is weird because they talk to me just fine normally.

Finally, DH gets on there (sigh) (I know) and lays it out: stop it.  WTF?  And it all comes out.  Their Dad is looking in on FIL and PlantageNOT is pissed and accusing Uncle of being traitor and generally throwing a fit.  DH needs to take care of his dad.  Because faaamily.

DH tells them:  so, I need to quit my job, lose my house and insurance with a wife that is sick and a new baby and move back to shithole town to babysit a man who can take care of himself if he would just do what his doctors say...in addition, a man that allowed his kids to be systematically destroyed for years and did nothing, and has (along with PlantageNOT) pretty much ruined the last 9 months?  How about no.

Yeah, they didn't have much to say about that.  But they did stop using my fb as a means to bug DH.

After that, all was quiet for a second.  Then, PlantageNOT starts to have money trouble.  See, FIL stopped paying on the bills because he wasn't living there, and she had bought a crazy expensive security system that cost her thousands of dollars (according to her) because of her previous stalking allegations.  She had two cars to pay for (she had an SUV AND a sports car), and because they were dumbasses they would run up their credit cards, then take equity loans to pay them off...then run up the cards again while paying off the loans.  Lather, rinse, repeat.

But now, she couldn't pay the bills and FIL just flat refused.  The divorce was dragging out because PlantageNOT had gone all Stand By Me and decided that FIL had the equivalent of Vern's Pennies (but in hundreds of thousands) stashed somewhere.  Spoiler:  not likely.  This is a blue collar guy and they spent as quick as they got it.  She had also hired a private detective to find said money and given them several thousand.  So she was losing the house and had to move.

(NOTE:  DH got the name of this PI and called him because he was concerned about PlantageNOT getting scammed.  He told the PI about her issues and the PI told him that at first he had bought into what she had said, but as time went on he had started to understand that something was wrong.  Or he figured out that DH was onto him.  Either way, he dropped her case, and she was PISSED.)

So that brings us to Attempted Scam #1.  First, PlantageNOT asks DH to cosign for her new apartment.  Now, when we got together, DH's credit wasn't great.   But we had rehabbed the hell out of it in time to buy our house and I guard our shit like Gandalf vs the Balrog.  

24 hours later, PlantageNOT calls while DH is at work....because she wanted to arrange for him to cosign 'like he said he would'.  After he said no.  She was acting like it never happened because we would find out later she was telling everyone that I was controlling DH.  So if I said ""oh, ok"", then she could go back and tell him I was fine with it and he would play ball.

Except DH and I are a team, you dumbass.  

So, I said:  ""I'm sorry, PlantageNOT,  but we can't do that.""

Her:  ""But DH said he would!""

Me:  ""No, I don't think so.  Either way, we won't be on the hook for anyone else's bills.""

Her:  ""I pay my bills, you wouldn't have to worry!""

Me: (in my head) high pitched buzzing ...""Be that as it may, that won't be possible.""  (You shall not pass!)

She did get an apartment.  In our town.  Glob help me.  Strangely, she only visited a handful of times in two years, despite living less than a half hour away.  That later became my fault, naturally. 

The second time, DH had let it slip that we were thinking about buying a new vehicle.   He was gonna take my old car and we would get rid of his truck because baby and huge giant breed dog.

Cue call from PlantageNOT, again during the day when DH is at work:

Her:  Hey, I wanted to talk to you about a great idea I had.  I know you need to get rid of the truck and need a bigger SUV.   Why don't we trade?  I'll take DH's paid off truck and you can take my huge SUV.  There's only a couple years of payments left.

Me:  I don't think that will work.  I have a particular mid sized SUV in mind.  Yours is too big and a V8 eats too much gas.  Thanks, but we are good.

Her:  But, it's a great deal!  The payments are only $500 and change per month!

Me:  For you, sure.  But not for us.  That SUV is 5 years old and you and FIL towed a boat back and forth with it all that time, plus you chain smoke in it.  I. Have. A. Baby.  Additionally, I can trade in DH's truck and with my credit get a brand new SUV that I actually want for less than $300 per month.  So no.  We will not be doing that. (YOU SHALL NOT PASS!)

Her:  Well, why don't you sell the truck and give me your car.  Then you can take my SUV AND buy what you want!

Me:  So now, you want me to give you my paid off car....all for the privilege of taking on your debt on an SUV I don't want PLUS buy the SUV I do want...so we would have TWO payments with a new baby at home just to fix your money problem?

Her: ::crickets::

Me:  Nope.  We won't be doing that.

When I told DH that, he was furious.  His spine grew a few more inches that day.  The change was coming, ya'll.  And fast."

Nothing in my tone of voice that he can pick up on to call me rude (he wants everyone else to sound chirpy, positive, to show manners and to be respectful, meanwhile if he's angry or upset we're not to mention it because then we're bullies).

250,I Had to Go on Vacation to Find a MILITW,McDuchess,0,20,423,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536071239.0,9cw3ft,"Last week, we were in MA on vacation. Rather than spend a second day sweating through the Freedom Trail in the mid 90's temps, Husband and I drove up to Good Harbor beach in Gloucester. It's gorgeous, BTW. And there, in all her glory, I saw the MILITW.

I was lying on the beach, people watching, when she arrived. Directing her daughter and SIL, along with their adorable little boys, about 1 1/2 and 3, she plowed through the crowd till she found her spot, right at the water's edge. Another woman was sitting just behind where MILITW staked her claim, watching her son in the water. No matter. This was the MIL's territory now. So she took the woman's boogie board, picked it up and moved it so it would no longer encroach on her spot.

Her daughter spent the entire time we were there, smiling anxiously, except when talking to her kids. Then she looked sincere. Son in law, OTOH, spent the entire time as far away from her as humanly possible, scowling. He stopped when, again, interacting with his children, or when his BIL showed up and started treating him like a companion, not a servant. 

I got squicked out when the daughter needed sunscreen on her back, and her mother grabbed it and put it on her, rather than the husband. Daughter had the anxious smile plastered on her face the entire time. 

MIL took charge of the kids as much as she could, although, once FIL showed up, it was clear that both of them preferred him to his wife. The older son, especially, she tried to monopolize, but he was pretty adept at avoiding her and finding one of the other adults to interact with.

During the time we were there, there were no fireworks or theatrics. Just the typically ""I'm in charge of the world"" bullshit we see so often from JNs, and the uncomfortable responses, in varying fashion, from the people who are unfortunate enough to be associated with them. 

Me, I was more than happy to read my Kindle book on my phone, and take surreptitious visual snapshots of the bitch. Sunglasses are so very useful, aren't they?"

Well, home boy decides at the last minute that ""it would be rude"" to ask his mom to not join us. Background info, I had told him, ""It's fine we can eat dinner together, but maybe when we start our  movie, we can just watch it, me and you."" 

And then, after an hour of doing my hair and make up, he starts getting defensive. ""Well that's just rude if we tell her she can't enjoy this part of her house bs"". (His dad passed away 10+ years ago, he said he would look out for her). Which i totally understand.

But almost 10 years (in feb) of being the third wheel in my own God damn relationship, and I'm starting to get fed up. I'm almost to the point that i want to break up.

One of FH’s oldest friends, who we want to officiate our ceremony, suggested moving it to the fall of 2019, so postpone it by 3-4 months instead of 12.  That I can live with, and it’ll also make it a bit easier to find vendors who are still available.  Another bonus is that our honeymoon somewhere warm won’t have insufferable heat, because it’ll be in the beginning of fall instead of the beginning of summer.

Now, the advice I need is twofold:
•How should I tell my mom we want to pay for the wedding ourselves?
•What should I write to the people we’re uninviting?  “We’ve had to push the wedding back and move the venue, and the new venue can only accommodate 100 people”?"
253,"Weddings, and avoiding the drama!",pineapplehead_123,0,3,5,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536147662.0,9d5oaa,"I cut off contact with my NM almost two years ago, after she said she didn't care about me, my upcoming wedding, or the impact her having an affair had (in that, which dad do I have walking me down the aisle and how to explain that to the rest of the family???)

My real dad's a drunk so hes  not invited to the wedding as  he would ruin it (he came to the engagement party and hot on all my friends) My Nsister was invited to our engagement party and text back that she had a run to go to so couldn't make it (because obviously a run is more important than your sisters engagement party!), Knowing it would upset me not having the kids there. And now I asked my other half sister if she would make my bridesmaids bouquets, and also to be a bridesmaid, and she responded "" cool on all counts"". Which upsets me too as it's like she doesn't give a fuck.

Is it too fucking much to ask for a single family member to be happy for me and excited for the wedding??? "
254,Finally told her the truth!,AlexisO87,0,1,2,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536139126.0,9d4qug,"Sorry for the long backround and story.

Grew up with extremely abusive father and binge drinking mother. Both narcissistic AF. Moved out when I was a teenager,(16) and never spoke to them. Until I became an adult I began to feel guilty for resenting them.(Thinking maybe my memories were exaggerated considering I was a teenager.)  And so I moved back to the city they reside in and started talking again (This was about 12 years later). Taking them out for dinners, movies etc. But quickly began to realize (even though my father is to old to beat me anymore) they never really changed. They are both horrible right wing extremist that are racists and hypocrites about religion. And my mother's drinking had only gotten worse. Hospital visits due to seizures (even bit her own tongue off) . the amount of emotional distress it was causing me nearly sent me into ending my own life and destroying the only good relationship I have ever had. So I went back to NC again.

Months later (est. 8+ months) my mother had called me several times. Not hearing from them since I went NC. I thought maybe it may have been some sort of important family emergency. So I text her back later asking what she wanted. (Months go by in a flash for her as she's usually drunk 24/7 for about 3-4 months then will be sober for a couple weeks and the cycle continues.) She just replied with ""Haven't heard from you in a while. Just wanted to see what you are up to."" As if we haven't talked for that week.

Angry, and not wanting to hear from her again I text back telling her that she is a narcissist that only cares about herself and the bottle, she lives with a man who beat me for half of my life. (They recently took in a man who needed a place to stay for a while who coincidently also molested me as a child) Told her that the man she now calls a roommate was a child molester. (Never told them that he molested me and a couple of other girls o found out recently) That my brother and his girl friend are sociopaths that commit fraud to make money. And that her and all those people that I once called family in that house are people I never want to see or speak to ever again.

I never got a reply back from her. But these last few days I have never felt more free! I feel good about finally telling the truth about why I don't want to see them ever again, instead of just disappearing like I normally do. I know I should probably seek therapy to finally be rid of all my demons( as I suffer with depression and a taste for alcohol myself) . But I felt like this was a big step for me. Even if she was probably drunk by the time she got the message. It feels good to finally get it out there.

Side note: Before I get any comments on my mother and her drinking, know that for years while I was NC with my father, I tried to get my mother help with her drinking. And she not only relapsed every time but she would take others down with her. Convince people in her AA meetings to get a drink with her. And even people in half way houses that were months sober. "
255,I've been researching dysfunctional family characteristics and just...ugh,throwawaybayleef,0,14,32,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536142260.0,9d522s,"As the title explains, I've been researching dysfuntionals families, mostly the roles within them.

This is mostly because, in another post, somebody told me my little sister was what you call a ""lost child"" and I wanted to look into it more.

I'm actually really uncomfortable with what I discovered.

I hate to be ""that person"" but I'm actually crying right now.

Because of something I read on the internet.

Wow I feel pathetic.

First I was reading up on the Lost Child, the websites I was looking at made it seem like the only reason the Lost Child is neglected as opposed to physically abused is because they're sweet and smol and quiet and just...stay out of drama.

That's right kiddos, remember all those times you were struggling to hold back tears and kept asking yourself why your parents can't just leave you the fuck alone when you try so hard to stay off their radar? Obviously you just weren't trying hard enough to stay out of the drama.

Now, I figured that maybe they weren't actually saying that the reason Lost Children don't get physically abused is because they ""avoid drama"" as opposed to the fact they are just lucky enough to not matter to their abusive parents and perhaps I perceived it wrong, perhaps due to being oversensitive about this issue.

I made the mistake on reading about Scapegoats.

Oh wow,

According to some research us Scapegoats are ""often mean"" and we often bring our problems(ie: abuse) on ourselves because we're just that, mean, defiant, angry. In fact, most of what I've been looking at says that scapegoats ""choose their role in the family""

:')

Lmao k

I don't know how often I tried to fly under nmoms radar but couldn't. When I didn't mess up she would just invent things to be mad about. I didn't choose to be abused, and my attempts to be a good little Lost Child and avoid drama didn't work.

I brung nothing on myself.

To say that I did implies that I deserved it, or that I could have easily not been abused if I just took a few moments to be a smol bean who avoids annoying nmom and I could have gotten neglected instead (which would have also been garbage as well, I'm not trying to pretend being a Lost Child is all sunshines and rainbows, just that it was what I really wanted when I was growing up)

&#x200B;

Yes when I was 4 years old getting beat mercilessly for some perceived slight against nmom it was because I chose that lifestyle for myself. You see, I was just a mean little defiant angry turd who actively chose to be abused by my mom because I was a glutton for negative attention. 

And when I was 7 and my mom trashed my room before insulting me, only to later justify her actions as ""being mad at all of you kids"" I was singled out because I wanted to be, and my siblings didn't.

Or how about when I was 10 and my mom put her cigarette out of me for the first, but not the last, time. I was just goading her with my thirst for negative attention. If I could just try and stay out of her way and avoid conflict it would all be good.

I was a good kid,

I did amazing academically, was top-of-the-class for almost everything.

When I was home I'd just hide out in my room whenever I wasn't doing chores.

I would try and avoid my nmoms foul moods, but it was always to no avail because I'd end up getting dragged out of bed at night and getting beat. For no reason. For whatever reason Godwin invented.

And did ya'll know how us Scapegoat's are supposed to heal from our childhood abuse?

Well, according to one article I read, Scapegoat's will be fine once we finally learn to be good people.

Does that enrage anyone else, or just me?

It's the golden children who need the real help.

Witnessing their sibling being abused, and sometimes taking part in perpetrating that abuse, according to these articles is actually more damaging than being abused.

I'm so sorry to my siblings who abused me, if I'd known it hurt them more than it hurt me I'd have just...been a good little girl and not drawn attention to myself like I'm supposed to right? Because if I was good I wouldn't have been abused right? According to research, yes.

A part of me seriously hopes I just came across some bogas articles, but I don't know.

They were right about some things.

Most of my adult relationships are shallow and inauthentic.

I am self-destructive.

One of my GC brothers is an emotional husband and is an overacheiver.

My edad does seem to think that something horrible will happen if he stops enabling nmom, but he's in no way sympathetic like all these articles harp on about.

Oh, I don't know.

I managed to find some articles that contradict the concept of ""being a scapegoat is like, totally your own choice man"" but I don't know.

Maybe they're right. Maybe all my trauma would ""go away"" if I was a ""nice person""

Maybe abuse doesn't leave scars, and my unhappiness is due to my own personal faults.

It seems incredibly narcissistic and arrogant to ignore the articles that paint scapegoats in a negative light and challenge my perception of my families dynamic.

But, it just seems so wrong and untrue.

I don't know.

I just don't know.

256,This definitely isn’t helping my case with MIL...,queenstower,0,10,117,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536102666.0,9d0q30,"Ughhhhh. 
My mother-in-law has gotten it into her head that her poooooooor son has to do everythiiiiiing in our marriage; breadwinner, child-raiser, maid... while I’m... I don’t know exactly what she thinks I spend all my time doing. I take classes two days a week and I run a very small business (more of a lucrative hobby, except for the frantic two months before Halloween, which is my busiest time of year) when our one-year-old’s naps. 

So recently DH and I have been helping to take care of his elderly maternal grandmother (MIL’s mother), just a couple of days a week. She needs full time care but isn’t comfortable with the idea of going to a senior living facility, so various family members pitch in where we can (but DH is the only one of the nine grandchildren on the schedule consistently, simply because he can work from his computer anywhere and he and I both have experience in senior care). She lives a little over an hour away; we usually stay a few days at a time and have our own room in her house with a pack n play for DD. 

So that’s where DH is right now. Usually I would be with him, but I have a very pressing work deadline and decided to stay home to get that done (I cannOT work at his grandmother’s house; she and DD aren’t on the same schedule at all so it’s constant care for SOMEONE between 7 am and 10 pm, at which point I fall into bed exhausted because I’m also eleven weeks pregnant and TIRED. ALL. THE. TIME.). 

DH ran home last night to get a piece of equipment that he’d forgotten for work and returned this morning. I suggested he take DD with him, since he was planning on coming back tonight anyway. I had to make a trip into town and wanted to take the train/uber to avoid parking, and hauling a car seat and a newly mobile toddler around would slow me down considerably. And DD LOVES her great-grandmother. 

DH reluctantly agreed (he knows it isn’t easy taking care of BOTH Grandma and DD, though he seems to have no problem having ME do it... enjoy a taste of what I’ve been up to lately, darling xoxo). He takes the baby. I go off on my supply run. 

And then I find out that MIL decided to drive up to her mom’s after she gets off work today. **Fuck.** She’s like a dog with a bone, in her notion that DH has to bear an unfaaaair burden in our relationship. I’ve mentioned it in my post history. Doesn’t matter what you TELL her, because that would require listening when other people talk, which is uh. Not my MIL’s strong suit. 

Part of me can’t even bring myself to care anymore— she can think whatever nonsense she wants. But I’m frustrated because DH will correct her, but he never wants to confront her. He insists that it’s better to just correct her when she says something stupid and disregard her “helpful” advice. Basically he just says “Nope, that’s not what happened” and then proceeds to ignore her... which might be the better way to deal with it than open confrontation (they used to have screaming fights when he was a teenager, so I guess he’s come to see any sort of direct conflict as a fight, and therefore ineffective). 

Which is great and all, I guess /s, but it also leaves me feeling like he doesn’t defend me to his mother. He insists that he does. 

I love him dearly but he does tend to be a little dismissive of emotional reactions, probably because of his upbringing with his mother and stepmother. 

But this isn’t /justnoSO; while my SO can be a bonehead, he’s not a justNO. We have a game plan: he’s going to spend MIL’s entire visit talking me UP and singing my praises, and never give her the breathing room for passive aggressive criticism. I trust him to do it, too, if only because his mother’s monologuing annoys him and this gives him a chance to head it off at the pass. And while he might be a little salty that I had him take the baby with him, he’s still got quite a lot to sing about, if I do say so myself ;)

I’m still bracing myself for twenty-seven poorly-spelled texts, later today, because that’s how MIL rolls. I probably won’t respond. I’m still pissed off from her shenanigans at my baby’s birthday party (haven’t posted about that yet) AND the stupid phone call to my DH that she didn’t know I was present for (see bitchbot)."
257,When your narc parent goes nc with you,savannablues,0,49,34,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536076230.0,9cwuvf,"There's a lot of comments on here from posters who have been brave enough to share their experiences of going nc with a narc parent, and I admire you're strength and bravery in taking that courageous step. For me I had been preparing for this moment for sometime. I finally in a phone call challenged my mom's  behaviour. I was calm and polite but asked how her (most recent and extremely hurtful) behaviour had made me feel.  Was planning to tell her not to contact me again. I've since learned that narcs cannot handle the word feelings. She swore at me, muttered some spiteful comment and hung up on me. That was over 4 years ago now and she has not contacted me since. I doubt she ever will. She was the 'ignoring' type of narc. I have no contact with any family. My question is, how do you cope with knowing that your parent can cut you out of their life without a backward turn as though you never existed. I feel such a huge sense of rejection. I know and understand she never loved me, nor my father who was a narc too, but I really struggle to make peace with how worthless it makes me feel everyday. I can't help feeling if my own parents can't love me, maybe I'm unlovable. I was so ready to go nc after years and years of gaslighting, cruelty, neglect, but even at the end she took away my one chance to finally make a stand. Thanks for reading.

258,"Q about pain, trauma, dissociation/Endometriosis sisters: Am I the only one?",Getting_Help,0,4,5,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536102913.0,9d0r71,"So I have had health problems essentially my entire life (common with N’s). It was mostly autoimmune and IBS-type things. I learned to hide my suffering (we all know what it’s like to be sick around N’s) so I wouldn’t be tormented anymore. For the most part, it worked. They had no clue when things were going on.

Things got REALLY bad in college as I was bedridden with full body pain, autoimmune symptoms, and unable to keep water down. Essentially, dying slowly. Hid that too.

I was finally diagnosed and treated for Endometriosis which was really severe and destroying my daily life since middle school. My period was always hell and suspected it, but I get confused when I read others’ experiences like “I couldn’t get out of bed,” “couldn’t go to school,” “debilitating,” etc. I’m like “What are you talking about?” 

Every time since starting, I was violently sick from both ends, screaming in pain, tunnel vision-ing, shaking, but could walk out of the bathroom as if I was absolutely fine. The pain was more manageable at school because I knew that I had to push through and learned how to stop myself from passing out. Maybe it’s because I had a distraction?

QUESTION: It was as if I could turn the pain “on and off.”  That I could be in as much pain as I “allowed” my body to be in. Now that I’ve had my Endo surgery and am not in as much pain, I am realizing just how bad it was and am horrified how ANYONE could hide THAT much unimaginable, incomprehensible pain as if nothing is happening. I can’t even wrap my brain around how much pain I was in. Now that I ""allow"" myself to feel it, I'm feeling it.

Literally what even?! Is this even a thing? Don’t know if it’s a trauma skill of dissociating (a useful one) or some amazing willpower. I had been practicing it since I was a child and still continue today. Obviously the need to be fine for the N’s would play a large part in this. But I think you can push yourself and dissociate through any pain if needed.

I was very underweight, constantly sick, constantly tired. The list goes on. I matched so many of the symptoms. I am mostly stuck in shock now. I am just so baffled that my Nmum and Edad were that neglectful. Only towards me.

I should have been taken too a doctor. Even once for a checkup. 

Part of me strongly believes my Nmum allowed all of it to happen. I barely ate due to being always upset. My Nmum enjoyed it. She bragged. Shes always been obsessed with my body. Which makes me think she knew i was not okay. But let it keep going because she got to talk about it and get attention.

I've had my mom on a information diet as well as just have been spending less time at home whenever possible. She hates it. After a few months here my mom has finally found someone to convince she's saintly so she can play the victim and soak up whatever praise they lavish upon her. Not only that, they just happen to have all of this old stuff just sitting around that mom could use. It's hideous and doesn't match at all, but mom would rather just have everything handed to her.

Part of the couch set looks hauntingly familiar to the furniture my dad left us with when I was four (she probably hand-picked that one just to trigger me over my father's death) and does this whole ""Come out and help me figure out where it goes"" speil in which I tell her she's doing great and go back to what I was doing.

261,"Christmas, the gift that keeps on giving.",Stefaki,0,17,34,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536043105.0,9ct516,"Hey llamas! I am back for some advice. B.B. can fill you in, but my JN is my mom. I moved far away and she visits (but doesn’t stay with us) for usually 5-9 weeks at a time.

Last year she visited at Christmas-B.B. can fill you in on that ridiculousness. She came for 9 weeks and while she was here me hubs and DD went away for 4 days, between Christmas and New Years. She was told well in advance, and while she was not happy and tried multiple times to change our plans, she dealt with it.

This year the plot thickens...first she asks if we are planning on going away again like last year. I tell her yes, probably for longer than last year. So she started by saying that she is coming sometime around Nov 20 and leaving by Jan 20. Fuck, it’s a long time but what can you do. Then it changed to “ a month, month and a half”. Then it was a month. Then she says that she can only come for 3 weeks from the 15th of Dec. And if we are going away for a week what’s the point? So “think about what you want to do and let me know what I am doing. And then if that’s the case YOU can tel DD that I am not coming for Christmas”

So I feel like this is really manipulative of her. She knows that this is our only time to go away as a family ALL year and she is basically saying don’t go? For her? But I feel like if her circumstances have changed then that’s on her to change her plans? Also cause she’s sneaky this may just be her seeing what we will do (she likes to test people) and then coming for 6 weeks anyways. 

I feel confused and I don’t know what to do. On one hand I definitely do not want to miss out on our family time and our one chance to travel during the year. On the other hand I feel like a horrible person to tell her no, not changing our plans come another time. But that’s what she wants right? Either for me to feel like an asshole or to bow down. Ugghh.

Also pertinent, I believe, is the convo we had yesterday. She was telling me about some family drama and then:

Me: so basically [cousin] set a boundary and [aunt] is not talking to them?! That’s mature!!

 Mom: but I agree with her, your generation has no respect.  No respect for family members for their age, and their station in life and the family. No respect just for our age at least!

Me: well I think every generation feels that to some extent with the younger generation

Mom: no! It wasn’t like that with my parents generation or with mine. Your generation has no respect!

Me: (not in the mood for an argument) nope, I guess not.

Upon discussing this with hubs, my biggest question is how?? How are we so disrespectful?? What does showing respect look like to her? Also this catering to old people in our family is something she complained about my whole life. It’s like I saw you do shit cause you “had” to and it made us all miserable....why would I want to perpetuate that?? Also is she just pissed cause she kissed ass her whole life expecting the same and now the ass kissing is coming to an end??

Sorry if this is rambly, but I feel like this is the undercurrent of most of our arguments. I am a disrespectful, inconsiderate little shit (as has been told to me by her many times and in front of others) cause I don’t do what she wants, when she wants. She has always hated her parents and done bare minimum to please them, usually not pleasing them at all, she is hardly one to talk about respecting people! 

I guess I am angry cause I have to tell her that we won’t change our plans  at Christmas and I know it’s going to be a shit show. I am so over all this drama. I am tired of being an asshole cause I put MY FAMILY first. She once said to me while we were arguing “You have your husband, your daughter, your business, and me? I am a distant FOURTH!!!” Um, yes? That’s how it’s supposed to be??? Which one of those things should you be ahead of????

Am I wrong? I don’t feel like I am wrong. My husband is pissed and says there is no way we are not going away like we planned.

Edit: I just want to be clear that when she visits (from another country, an ocean away) she does not stay with me. Her parents have a family home here (5 minutes away) and she stays there."

She was practically shaking with rage.,HughMungusIsMyGod,0,30,141,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536002081.0,9coaw2,"Basically, a while back, my best friend was visiting for a short while and we wanted to play computer games but I only had my one computer. I asked my Nmom politely if I could borrow one of her two laptops when she was done with them for the night. She yelled at me and belittled me in front of my best friend for having dared to even ask. She takes my things without asking all the time, by the way and if I say anything about it, like ""can you please ask before taking my things?"" She yells at me about how selfish I am and she shouldn't have to ask, I should just be fine with it.

Anyway, afterwards, I grabbed some paper and crayons that happened to be laying on a table in the living room and vented in the form of a comic strip, which I titled ""The Angry Potato"". Yes, I drew her as a potato. While it was exaggerated, the essence of it was honest and it's a venting mechanism so who really cares anyway? It depicted her screaming at me and everything but with more vulgarity and I wrote in all the things she has said or implied in the past but would never admit to saying. For example, saying how she treats my brother better or that how I feel is not important. It also highlighted how suicidal I felt and how much she destroys my self worth every day.

Fast forward about a year and a half. I'm 20 and living with her out of necessity and convenience with my 2 year old son. That little comic had ended up crumpled and shoved behind some furniture and I'd totally forgotten about it by then. Somehow, she found it and her very first instinct was to fly into a rage about how I depicted her as the ""bad guy"" and it makes HER feel like shit and ""what if someone else had found it and thought differently of me"". I was not surprised that she was primarily concerned about her image and upholding the façade that's she's a loving mother who actually gives half a shit about me as a person. 

She did not once mention or show any sort of concern about the parts that displayed my clear emotional devastation and suicidal thoughts. The whole rampage was about her and how dare I write such a thing. As if I'm not even allowed to have feelings or write them on paper and discard them. I was disgusted by her reaction but I said nothing and kept my face as neutral as possible, as I've learned to do most of the time she speaks to me. 

I guess that's all for this time. As always, thank you for reading and being such a good support community. You're all wonderful and I wish you the best possible lives. "

Besides that, she spends the whole day watching TV. The most physical thing she'll do is go for a neighborhood walk, and that's only a few times a week. So I don't think she's really that ""tired"" from being at home all day.

My theory is that my Nmom realized that because she gave that whole spiel about how kids *have* to listen to their parents in front of her mother, her mother will give her a harder time. Because here's the thing, my grandmother has actually been much more vocal about her displeasure about her daughter's behavior in recent years and has even grilled her a few times. Like, properly call her out and bring up all of her bad traits and misdeeds. And I think because Nmom said all that bullshit, her mother might just use that against her. Hence, she's sending her mom back early.

The only sad thing here is that she's sending her mother back during typhoon season, where things are always flooded and getting destroyed. My Nmom would rather put an 80+-year-old woman--who is her own mother, no less--in potential danger than possibly having to deal with said mother scolding her even more than she usually does. But again, I guess the good thing is that this just further reinforces how much of a monster she is."

266,So I think I found out Bankrupt Psycho’s issue with me,coconuts-commodities,0,7,70,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536034710.0,9csc05,"This whole thing makes me really upset. I’m a very easy going, calm, and also a emotional person, very sensitive to other people. I’ve never had to deal with anyone like her, so she gives me a lot of anxiety. And I generally have a hard time not taking her personally, if anyone can tell so far, 

My bf said he tried to talk to her and asked why she keeps acting like that to me? He said she just repeatedly screamed “no one said I didn’t like her, no one said that” “no one said anyone didn’t like her” when all he said was “mom why do you keep acting that way to (my name)? She never did anything wrong to anyone.”

He said it was a weird interaction. 

And then later she said she doesn’t feel comfortable and is embarrassed by herself when I am there. And feels she can’t talk (about her multitude of bankruptcies, work,  life, etc) issues. (She is constantly just angry, yelling, having a nasty attitude with her mom that lives there about these things, so I know what she’s talking about) 

1. I don’t think this is fair to act insane and nasty to me. But I do understand she is like that with everyone and has something wrong with her 

2. But I do think if you have a mental issue, or some other deeply rooted psych issue, it’s not anyone else’s responsibility except your own as a grown adult. 

3. She’s a grown forty something. Get your life together. 

-So, I wanted to ask if that little except where she said she doesn’t feel comfortable around me makes sense? Do these Narcissistic Personality Disorder MIL’s ever feel guilty or feel bad? 

-Now that she’s comfortable with me, I think she feels she can do that now. I also think she doesn’t like other women in general. She doesn’t really have any girl friends. And she’s always nasty. Which I’ve shared that theory before how she makes comments about money or vacations, etc.

for background, i’m 19, nonbinary (important because egg donor exclusively calls me by my birthname/deadname), have been living on my own for nearly 6 months, and i’m currently working on trying to survive amidst the emotional/psychological pressure of recovering from abuse. my SO has been wonderful in helping me (including spending a whole night where we stayed up and tried to uncover some dark shit that happened in my past) but my job currently has us long distance which makes today’s events all the more difficult. 

my egg donor has been blocked on my previous phone since about may of this year. my dad has reached out rather inconsistently to talk to me here or there. it’s far from unusual for me to go for a couple months without talking to him, as from around may to the end of july there has been minimal responses. i recently got a new phone. i didn’t tell her or my dad. it’s been exactly three days with this phone. 

i received an email last night that i didn’t see until just now that says:

“(op’s birthname/deadname):

I hope all is well. Your father tells me you are very busy. 

We have been trying to reach you and you are not responding to calls or texts. It looks like some of the texts are not being delivered. First, it worries us when you don't respond, and it causes us to be concerned that something may have happened to you. I would like for us to be able to check on your safety and also contact you in case of an emergency. PLEASE CONTACT US TO LET US KNOW YOU ARE SAFE.  Are you willing to do this?

Also, based on what we see on our account from AT&T it looks like you are no longer using your phone. Again, this causes me to worry and wonder if you are ok. Or, it may indicate that you have your own phone plan and no longer wish to be part of the Family Plan. If this is the case, PLEASE LET US KNOW ASAP.  We will need to update our account. (younger brother) is in need of a phone now because of all the traveling he will be doing with soccer. If you are not using our plan, we will add (younger brother) in your place. 

Finally, if you have a new phone number are you willing to give it to us? Again, I would like to be able to contact you in case of emergency. 

Again, I hope you are safe and well. I am here whenever you are ready to reach out.”

ohhh boy. oh boy. oh boy. 

i don’t even have the proper mental capacity to analyze and respond to every part of this email. my brain has been absolutely fried from work (70+ hours a week/no days off), stresses of moving into a new place (my entire front room is FILLED with boxes), and adding this on top of my already fragile mental state doesn’t exactly help matters. 

i know it appears like she’s just sending a casual email worried about a child, but there’s reasons she got blocked and i packed up and left with someone i didn’t know too well to a city i had never been before in the first place. 

how do i respond? do i respond? i don’t know what to do but i do know i feel sick to my stomach right now. "
268,Thought Dicksmack Paddywhack might be coming around. We thought wrong. Advice on when to finally confront?,uh_lee_sha,0,9,83,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536018519.0,9cqgk8,"So since my last post a month or so ago, Dicksmack Paddywhack started contacting us more. We had never officially gone no contact and always hoped that with enough boundary setting and reality checking, eventually she would come around. Her attempts to talk to us actually seemed sincere and she was showing more awareness for others than either of us had ever known she was capable of. SIL has been (in mine and DH's opinion) overly cruel to DP and we actually started feeling kind of bad for her. We agreed that she was putting forth effort to make amends, but probably wasn't sure how to.

Out of the blue about two weeks ago, she texted DH that she was thinking of taking time off to come visit us before DH deploys again (she's never done this before. Usually she guilt trips us into visiting her, but has never offered to travel to see us). DH wasn't thrilled with the idea of her visiting and told her he was trying to go back to our home state before he left so he could see everyone.

DH and I chatted about the possibility and agreed that it would probably be a good idea for him to see his mom before leaving the country. We agreed that if she apologized for her behavior at our wedding that we would help her find a hotel near our home, let her visit the house with supervision and do some touristy things together for a weekend. 

To test the waters of her newfound interest in our lives and attempts to repair things, I sent her a text saying, ""Would love to chat and put together a system for when DH is deployed so that you're more in the loop. I get the vibe that you'd like to be more involved.""

AND THE BITCH GHOSTED ME. I sent that message over two weeks ago and no response. But she's posted on social media a dozen times since then and posted twice the same day I sent the message, so there's no reason she hasn't seen it or been able to respond. She hasn't said a peep to DH since either. Not even about visiting. So apparently that was all for show.

I so badly want to text her again and say, ""guess I was wrong. Good luck getting in touch with him while he's overseas"" or something equally snarky but DH has convinced me that saying anything else at this point would only make matters worse and let her ""win."" But I am SO pissed. Anytime I think about it, I get so angry. 

We have agreed a visit with her at this point is out of the question and I will absolutely not allow someone who ghosts me into my home. We move back to their state next summer. When do we have the come-to-Jesus no contact conversation with her? DH desperately wants to keep a relationship with his father, but it's impossible to do so and cut his mother out. If nothing else, a very straightforward, hurt feelings conversation of boundaries needs to happen. I imagine this works better in person. And that can't happen until after he's back from his deployment. His parents also have no idea we are planning to move back yet, because they're on a very strict information diet and are blocked on social media.

Any advice on when, where, how to proceed from here? When is too soon? When is too late? What boundaries should we absolutely express and how? I would love a fresh start, moving forward when we move and we genuinely hoped she would move forward with us, but apparently not. I'm usually a very kind, forgiving person, but this is just childish and I'm tired of being stressed out and angry because of her. "

271,How to not feel bad gor my nmom?,finnabustanuut,0,2,1,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536152135.0,9d69mk,"Hey everybody,

First i am so happy to found this subreddit. I love everyone of you for helping each other and being so strong although we all had it hard in life. My mom is a narcissist with depression, bipolar disorder and light schizophrenia. My dad was never in my life, he was always ""working"" and i saw him maybe one day in a week. After 2008 my parents split and i saw him maybe 20 times after that. My nmom is very very very intelligent. I think all narcissist are intelligent but shes just mind blowing. She would always think evrything out even before you could realize her first step. She knew how to manipulate any and everyone. She overthought anything she does to get to her goal. That makes it very difficult to see through her facade and see er her honest and evil intentions. My problem at the moment is that i told her  that i will move out in 4 months. Shes kind of supportive, maybe because she wants to livd with my stepdad alone but like i said, its hard to see her real intentions. But shes starting to make me feel bad for her. She cries occasionally and i am starting to ask myself if shes just act like this to make me bound to her. So when things with my stepdad doesnt work out well because hes a aggressive asshole, she hopes that i will take care of her when shes old. Anyways, i was the golden child and i always felt bad for my mom. This pity makes it hard for me to seperate my life from hers. Everything i see makes me feel sad for her in a fucked up way. Its just like the tragic of her and our life.  I try to remind me of the bad things shes done to us but as a golden child i wasnt physical abused like my sister. 
I am a very emphatic guy in general.
How do i stop feeling bad for her?"

Despite the title this isn't about an episode where Dr. Who meets Game of Thrones. This is about  VK's world view on asking others for help..  
Now VK doesn't really ASK for help.  She does the guilt game. And since my father passed away she has honed her guilting skills. 

Example 1: While on the phone she will say Wow, the grass really needs cut but I'm soooooo tired and in so much pain.   You are immediately expected to volunteer.  If not you will be given the silent treatment and this will be filled away in the ""reasons I'm a victim"" folder for later use. 

Example 2: You are over her house just going by to pick something up or drop it off.  She will use the 5 minutes you are there to tell you she almost died trying to carry a chair upstairs, she needs the bushes trimmed but just can't bring herself to get the energy, and she guesses she will have to hire someone to clean the gutters.  *guilt sigh*

Now if you are stupid enough to make a vague reference that you might be able to help at some point in the future,  consider yourself under a blood oath to do that thing.  It will also be done yesterday.  Now is not quick enough.  Tomorrow is out of the question. 

She assumes you will do it now and that it was promised.  You didn't say maybe, or I'll see.  You swore on the altar,  slaughtered a goat, and pledged your soul to it. You have 24-36 hours and what you have planned is irrelevant.  But these timelines are not told to you.  You swore the blood oath you should know. 

And when you forget because you have a life, work, college, children you raise etc., you  cause a tantrum.  That includes crying and screaming. She says she is a victim and no one cares about the old widow lady and how everything has to be done on thier timeline not hers.  (Even though that's the way it works in the real world if you ask a favor)

So if VK hints she needs her grass mowed, turn, run, and save yourself.  There's no sane way out of this guilt trap. "

274,nMom trying to get Medical Guardianship - Help (tw: entrapment),svensk100,0,4,5,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536108031.0,9d1e36,"Hi RBN, 

I've posted here a few times about my nMom trying to get medical guardianship over me. I am extremely concerned with the direction the case has taken and am looking for advice.

Here is why I am concerned:

1. My attorney is saying my options are basically go to an eating disorder inpatient program or let nMom be my medical guardian (and she would force this too). 
2. nMom and I do not reside in the state where the guardianship case is filed.
3. I have made it clear to my court-appointed attorney that nMom is abusive through evidence such as emails she has sent and that she should not be a guardian of anyone.
4. I went to an assessment for an eating disorder in a state I have never resided in (or even visited before) with a doctor and psychiatrist nMom chose. It doesn't seem like my lawyer fought that. He admitted that nMom probably got to talk to the assessors prior to my assessments.The doctor was very manipulative and disrespectful (and tried to sell me her book - seems like she was trying to gain a new patient (and $$ for her) for her program). I questioned some of her assessments in the appointment and now she's written an assessment of me saying nMom should be allowed to give me psychiatric drugs. The report also tries to make me look bad for being late, even though the court gave me to incorrect address on its order. 
5. Assessment with psychiatrist included her wanting me to comment on my body with pictures taken by a FM relative within my private residence without my knowledge or consent. 
6. Court-appointed attorney told me this had no connection to the court forcing me to attend this assessment: A few weeks before the court ruled that I should go to these assessments, GC brother held me hostage in a canoe for 30+ minutes and would not take me back to shore (despite me screaming for help and pleading out loud to God for help) unless I agreed to go to the doctor who was later appointed by the court (I ""agreed"" but didn't go with him). This was also him holding me hostage with the intent to take me across state lines.

There are more details, this is where I am starting and trying to piece things together. Can anyone help?"

We take Nana to mass every week. Spend all of Sunday with her - lunch and dinner. We buy her groceries weekly. Help make her grocery list. Take her to appointments. Fiance does her yard care and helps with chores and drives her where she needs to be. I help as much as I can. We do as much as we can.

Today she was asking me questions. Questions about money. And I was honest. I told her I have debt from student loans.

And she responded, ""Well then I guess marriage is out of the picture.""

After so much hate from Fiance's mother we both had found solace in his nana like a replacement mother in law. I did not expect this comment. I almost thought I was family. I almost thought she supported us.

Fiance snapped and we left the room. He talked to her later, telling her why he was upset and that we fully intend to get married and she knows that, and that we could really use her support since MIL is terrible, and she just shrugged and said she doesn't understand why we are so upset. She refused to acknowledge us as engaged, refused to see why we were hurt, refused to apologize or try to make things better. She tried to guilt him into staying for supper but he was so angry. So we left.

 We had a good night but it was kind of soured. It was hard to let him go home. I just want him close to me now.

I feel sad. I thought I'd broken through. I thought after everything I had done I'd finally become some kind of family but the truth is that no matter what I do they will never consider me family.

I knew I'd lost his mother but honestly I thought I could still slip into his nana's life. I guess not.

After he told her off, she then tried to call me.. she then preceded to try and guilt trip him to bring the kids since his grandmother was down (someone who hasn't met  DD because her reaction to finding out I was pregnant was strong gender preference... she also wants me to go out of my way, with three kids to deliver the baby to her.. ha!) That was not happening because after DH went off on her he hasn't returned any of her communications.

Right in that last sentence, right about the ""anything to try and repair it please let me know"" she goes from moapy the whole way through to sounding annoyed. 

She claimed to DH that FIL sent the text.. but I (and dh) doubts it. 

Kids schools have been notified and locked down. Teachers are aware, not that I even think she would know where DS2 is going, even if she figured out where DS1 is. I officially feel like she sees me as an incubator/hinderence for her grandchildren. 

Holidays are coming up, thanksgiving has been planned since Easter and its our first Christmas in our new house, so plans were to sit tight. We will see how dh's resolve holds. He has been coming out of the fog, the more he acknowledges what he has been taught and triggered the more pissed off at her he is getting. 

Edit: oh, forgot to say.. in the telling off she claims she's on meds for bipolar. I've been a patient with bipolar people before, she's not fucking bipolar. I wonder if she thinks she will garner sympathy with the mental illness thing since she knows I have serious and well medicated depression. "

TT is the one who takes all of our experiences with DS. She announced my pregnancy to all my friends, announced DS birth on Facebook, gave him cheesecake at 4 fricken months, etc. 

TT used to babysit 2 full days a week and one evening while DH and I were out. We've enrolled DS in a daycare, so now she is down to one evening a week, and one full day of babysitting. I feel that this is plenty of quality time. Wrong....

TT frequently mentions how she misses watching him twice a week and wants to spend EVERY weekend with us. I feel like that's too excessive, so this weekend when she asked us what we were up to, we politely said we were busy all weekend.

 DS goes to a weekly class on Sundays. We get a text from TT that morning asking if DS is going to class that day. We tell her that he might,  if he wakes up from his nap in time. We go to the class, everything is fun and great,  no TT.

Monday rolls around and TT is finally visiting. 

TT: So did DS go to class yesterday? 

Me: yes, he woke up from his nap really late but we were able to make it.

TT: he's in the ""name she shouldnt know because I've never told her"" class right?

Me: uh.... yea why.

TT: well I was across the street at the gym that morning and I stopped by class to see if you guys were there. Then I remembered he's in the ""name she shouldnt know"" class and I was there an hour early. I would have waited but I didn't want to wait for you guys if you weren't coming that day so I went home.

WTF.... Translation....so you just went to the building, looked up his class like a stalker, and then were going to wait around.... for over an hour for us to show up. UNINVITED.  We tell you we're busy all weekend, but you're just going to barge into our DS's class uninvited anyway. 

Then today when its finally time for her visit, we tell her to come for dinner at 5:30. Ya'll she showed up, unannounced,  2 and a half hours early while I'm literally in my pajamas repainting the kitchen! She gets here and I just continue to clean up while she's all ""come give Gramma  kisses!!!!!"" To my one year old. Because she does this all the time, she doesnt think about DS's schedule, so after 30 minutes of visiting, it's time for his nap. 

DH and I take DS to his room and he cries because he hates getting his diaper changed when he's tired. TT is complaining ""awww he's crying he wants to stay with Gramma"" and my DH (Oh how I love him) just closes the door in her face. 

This pales in comparison to what I've been reading on here lately, but this crap and worse happens all the time. She comes over without warning and just walks into our home or invites herself on our outings.

I just told her to go fuck herself for the last time and I won't even visit her when she's on her deathbed (she'd still be playing the victim anyway),arcanine911,0,15,138,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536078049.0,9cx5ho,"When my dad died a year ago, I tried to reconnect with my Nmom.  Fucking stupid, I know.  I've long accepted that she would never change and I wasn't trying to change her.  For some bizarre reason, I thought I could create some last happy memories with her as I was on the verge of becoming one of those people who loses both their parents when I'm only in my 20's.

I have this flaw where I try to see the good in people, and I have no idea where I developed this characteristic.  Maybe it was from the negative environment I grew up in?  Because of this I've been taken advantage of numerous times, and I'm telling you all now that I am DONE falling for this shit.  Some people are just plain fucking evil.

There were signs over the past year that she was hiding some shit, but I chose to ignore them as I didn't live there anymore and honestly, I didn't WANT to believe them.  She sold my brother's bike and pawned my grandmother's ring.  She and my enabling sister went to the social security office the day after my dad died to try siphoning money, and then had a wake for him without ever inviting me.

I knew it was money.  But I chose to ignore it and accept her vices.

Every Saturday she would call me and ask to hang out and we would; sometimes it would just be lunch and dinner, or sometimes we would take walks in the park and talk.  Sometimes she would laugh and actually listen to my stories and I knew deep down they were fake because all she wanted to know was if my brother had deposited money into my account to give to her.  If my brother HAD deposited money, she would hang out with me longer.  Otherwise, she would find excuses to leave such as claiming she was tired or had a dinner with a friend to attend.

Anyway, I should mention the most important part of all of this: my cousin ""John"".  John moved up here from SoCal over a year and a half ago to attend UC Berkeley and somehow he ended up living with my mom.  I do not know if he asked her to stay here or if it was the other way around.  

My mom and sister (yes, we talked again for a few weeks before I blocked her number completely because she was still a compulsive lying junkie) would constantly bitch to me about how lazy John was, how he refused to pay rent and get a part-time job, and how he would sleep in until noon on his days off.  As I said, I didn't fucking care as I didn't live there anymore.

But shit started affecting me as my mom would leave messages for me whining about how she needed groceries and had no food and other shit.  Since I wasn't giving money to her directly, it didn't bother me the first few times I drove across the city after an 8 hour fucking work shift just to deliver some water and random produce.  Finally I asked my mom why the fuck she wouldn't ask John to just walk across the street to help buy them shit and did she know how ridiculous it was that she was asking me to do this shit?  My mom isn't exactly disabled herself either.  We all live in a VERY large city where there are grocery stores and liquor stores mottled across every other block.  

My moms excuse was that it would be rude to ask John and that he was graduating in another year and to just tolerate it.

My brother and I have gotten along in life more than anyone else in the family and he told me he had a theory that my mom and sister was lying about John's antics.  She had done the **exact same thing** to me and my siblings to other people, all for the purpose of free money.  I decided to test out his theory.

I sent a text to John and asked if he could ""please try helping out more with groceries"" -- never once did I act accusatory or ask suspicious questions.  He immediately called me and said there was A LOT of misinformation about everything and he wanted to come clean about it.

1) On the second day he had moved in, my sister had told John to pretend he wasn't paying rent so that my brother and I wouldn't stop supporting my mom financially.  She told him not to trust anything I said and that I was ""crazy"".

2) John HAD been paying rent since the day he moved in.  He sent me picture messages of all the bank transactions linking the transfers directly to my mother's name.  

3) John also sent me picture messages of the texts my sister had sent him warning him not to speak to me, of her asking him for money, and bragging about how much ""she was ballin"".  These were antics my sister were well known for, so there was no way he could have just photoshopped them.

4) John had concerns about how my mom runs out of money quickly every month.  Apparently she was still disappearing for days at the casinos.  Additionally, John WAS bringing groceries him and taking my mom out to eat every other day; he had photos of them at restaurants with that fakeass witch smiling as I could see she was taking advantage of my own cousin..  All of this contradicted my moms whiny stories about how John never helped her ass out.

There was so much proof and information provided to me that I made *the final decision*: I was going to confront my mother and depending on how she reacted, I would cut her out of my life entirely.  Forever.

She picked up the phone and claimed she had told me everything John stated above and immediately became aggressive until finally telling me to ""just go kill myself"".  Yep, that was the proof I needed - my mother always acted like the victim when she was caught lying and playing people.  

I immediately called AT&T and cut off the cell phone bill I had been paying for her.  With all the money she's obtained from lying and stealing, I'm quite sure she's more than capable of paying her own bill.

I cancelled her name on the trip to NYC we were planning to take together later this month and instead worked it out with my husband to have him come instead.  NYC has always been my dream city to visit and I would rather go with the love of my life than a lying piece of shit.  The fees were nothing compared to saving my mental health.

Anyway, sorry for the long post but I wanted to let you all know that I have been much happier the past few days knowing I will never be in contact with this woman again.  Btw, on the same day I confronted her, she claimed she was having side pains and needed to go to the ER.  Magically, she called me from her house phone a few hours after I had disconnected her cell phone to try leaving me an angry voice message that I didn't even bother listening to.

We are all stronger than we think, and sadly sometimes we need we need a reminder to push ourselves to best capabilities but I am glad more than anything that I never gave up."

So, a little after we move out of her rental house, she fires her son, my DH, from his job at the family business.  Because she can.  She does this thinking that we will be destitute.

Twin sister realised about nmum years ago, because she was main scapegoat kid
I realised about a month ago
I’m all for going NC

Twin treated worst as kid but hasn’t gone NC
I was golden child till mental health took a nosedive, but still did whatever nmum asked (no matter what) so never overtly abused
So I don’t have clear/definitive explanation for the family for why going NC

Have read from a few different sources that trying to help a narcissist is futile and NC is best/healthiest way to go
Is this true?

I have a twin sister(20), a younger brother(14), and estepdad (who is naturally anxious/low self-esteem so is easily manipulated).
From what I can tell they’re all victims of nmum, so would like to stay in contact w them


I want to go NC with nmum and never go back to family house: only meet up w family elsewhere, and stay in contact by phone
Is that selfish?
Should I stay and actively try to break the others out the cycle of nmum’s emotional abuse? 
Would going NC just be callously leaving them behind to deal with nmum themselves, when actually I could/should help them break out/away?

Twin is the only other person aware of nmum: if brother and estepdad aren’t ‘awake’ yet
Is realising what Nmum is something only they can do for themselves? 
Or is that just a lie/excuse I’m telling myself so I can just run away with minimal guilt?

Nmum is a covert narcissist so I wouldn’t know where to start about telling someone or asking for advice

Don’t want my NC w nmum to make her treat the others worse
Don’t want to run away and leave them to deal with it by themselves

Nmum had a traumatic childhood so being this way is most likely a side effect of that trauma
Does that mean I should try harder to help her be less narcissistic, or does it make no difference?

289,My bro and SIL are terrible people for not being the right religion and getting a dementia sufferer the help she needs,CastielGalafran,0,19,37,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536092244.0,9czb58,"I posted here about a week ago venting my frustrations about having to live at home right now. Things have actually been pretty good in my house since then. I know it's not a permanent change, but I'm just enjoying the good moments before things turn bad again. If I'm going to survive in this house for the next nine months I need to find ways to not be miserable all the time and for me that means appreciating the lulls in JustNo-ness.

​

Unfortunately, it seems like my mom always has to be JustNo to either me or my brother. She can never be great to both of us at the same time. Growing up, if my brother wasn't being hit or screamed at it was me. If it wasn't me, it was my brother. Both of us took turns being GC and SG, although I ended being SG more often because, by virtue of being 5 years older than me, he achieved independence long before me.

​

I just want to rant a bit about this. I feel bad ranting because my mom has been so much better this week, but it's at the cost of my brother and SIL's emotional well being. This whole drama involving the three of them has been going on since before my brother got married, when it became clear that SIL was a permanent fixture. I love SIL. She has been there for me since we met five years ago. She's a genuinely good person: bookish but feisty, progressive and open minded for a devout Catholic, and will weather any storm for someone she loves. I was a bridesmaid at the wedding. My brother and I weren't very close growing up, but we have become very close in the last three years. They had their first child, a girl, at the start of June. This is also my parent's first grandchild and my first niece.

​

The entire issue my mom has with SIL is that she is Catholic. My mom is devoutly Orthodox. She has always dreamed of me and my brother marrying an Orthodox Greek immigrant. In fact, she arranged a marriage for me when I was a child. When that fell apart, she attempted to arrange another but I was having none of that. Because I refused another arranged marriage, I was called hateful, spiteful, and told that the devil was influencing me. When my SIL's great sin of Catholicism came to light, the wailing and moaning from my mom was great indeed. She went to multiple priests and monks, telling them that this evil Catholic girl was tempting her sweet son, tricking him into marrying her for his money (they were both teachers with the exact same salary). One priest told her that my brother is going to go to hell for marrying a Catholic. Thankfully, the others told my mom to chill the fuck out.

​

I was the one, however, that bore the brunt of the crazy regarding this. I was living at home at the time, and nearly every day I listened to my mom tell me never to have kids, because all kids abandon their parents. She told me that she failed in raising both of us and that there was no point in life anymore. I can't remember the number of times she threatened suicide during that time. My brother did not have a great spine back then, and she convinced him to have two different weddings with full receptions. One would be Catholic, but the real one, as she called it, was Orthodox. My poor brother and SIL had to shell out the money for two weddings, with the exact same guest lists, on the same weekend. And to this day my mom whines that everyone looked sullen and sulky at the Orthodox wedding (that may be because everyone was sullen and sulky because they were hungover and exhausted).

​

My brother eventually converted to Catholiscm two years ago, shortly after I ""came out"" as not Orthodox. So, of course, since both parents are Catholics, my niece was baptized as Catholic. Personally, I don't give a fuck. The kid could be baptized Pastafarian for all I care, as long as she is safe and happy. The baptism was short, there was free food, and I got to pet a dog. I was pretty happy. My mom, however, is beside herself and has been for the last two months. She is convinced that Niece hates her, that my SIL is an evil harpy, and that my brother doesn't love her. She's back to telling me that children will always be ungrateful and hateful. She says she doesn't even know who my brother is anymore and that SIL is just a ""mean spirited, vicious little girl"". My mom knows not to rely on me for emotional support anymore, which means she's started saying these things to my brother.  Every time my mom brings this stuff up to me I defend my brother and SIL. But it never changes anything.

​

She acts as if she's being a great MIL by not telling SIL any of this, but SIL knows damn well the way my mom feels. And it hurts her. SIL has only ever wanted loving in laws. She has an extremely unstable family herself, and she tries so hard to win my mom's approval. Her own mother has a severe case of dementia and doesn't even remember her own daughter. BMIL (brother's MIL) lived with them for the last two years while SIL taught full time and my brother was in law school. They tried their best to care for her but her condition only got worse. She would leave the house, forget where she lived, and wander into traffic. She'd become scared and belligerent. Eventually, her condition got so bad that, right before Niece was born, they had to put her in a nursing home. It was an extremely hard choice.

​

But my mom only talks about how selfish they are for doing this. She says they abandoned the woman and should have kept her in their home. She told me to never abandon her like that. I get that my mom doesn't want to end up like BMIL. BMIL is suffering and in a horrible condition. But, as I have told my mom time and time again, my brother and SIL dedicated every free moment they had for two years to caring for this woman. The only reason they put her in that home was because keeping her in their's would have been dangerous for BMIL and for Niece. This was the safest, most responsible thing they could do. 

&#x200B;

(ETA: Just to make how great of people/a couple my brother and SIL are, their first year of marriage was spent living with me, my cousin, and my parents all in one house. They had maybe three months of getting to live together in their own place before BMIL moved in. Then they had a week on their own between BMIL moving out and niece being born. They've always placed caring for each other and others as the priority. When she's old enough, I want to offer to babysit Niece for a week or two so they can take a vacation together. Lord knows they need one.) 

​

I just hope that my mom never says any of this to SIL. It would hurt her so much. Last night, I listened to a long phone call between my mom and brother in which they argued about all these things I've just shared. My mom kept going on about how he doesn't care about her anymore, about how everything changed since SIL came in the picture, how now she'll never have a ""good DIL"", and that Niece will never love her. After their phone call, I texted my brother and told him that I love him and SIL no matter what, and that they're good parents despite anything my mom says. I know they both feel guilty and frustrated. It sucks.

​

I'm just glad that I'll be moved out, making great income, and probably in another state by the time me and my boyfriend (assuming we end up getting engaged and all that) tie the knot. He's an Atheist Mexican guy from a long line of devout Catholics. I'm pretty much Agnostic. Neither of us would want a church wedding. I dream of having a barn wedding in a forest. I will not have two church weddings, no matter how many tantrums get thrown. If anyone has a problem with it, they'll be last in line at the taco truck and donut bar.

​

TL;DR: my mom thinks my SIL is an awful person for being Catholic, and thinks that she and my brother are bad people for putting SIL's suffering mother in a place with proper care."

As I posted yesterday, Darth Potter decided to crash a baby shower for a couple she's met once. What her end game was, I haven't a single fucking clue, but she was there for about 90 minutes before she was ""escorted"" off the property. And, without further ado, I humbly present ""Things Darth Potter thinks are appropriate for a baby shower"" or ""Dumb Shit my MIL Does, Vol 1.""

1. She brought a bottle of Jagermiester, and tried to get everyone to do shots. When told it wasn't that kind of party, she started doing shots by herself, so it ""wouldn't go to waste.""

2. She knocked over a picture, breaking the frame, then tried to blame it on the dog. When told that my friends didn't own a dog, she was shocked, because ""gay guys love dogs! How can they raise a child if they don't practice on a dog first?!?""

3. Tried to braid the surrogate's hair. She didn't ask first, just grabbed and started braiding.

4. Tried to claim dibbs on using the surrogate next. When told that you can't claim dibbs on another humans uterus, tried to double down by offering a lot of money for the next kid. The surrogate is a close friend of this family, and considers bearing a child for them to be a gift.

5. When told again that the surrogate wasn't a rent-a-womb, tearfully announced that it was her only chance to be a grandmother, due to my ""infertility"". I'm not infertile, I've just chosen not to have kids. The reason is none of her business and shall remain so until the end of time. Also, she has two other children who can provide her with a do-over baby.

6. Asked the soon-to-be parents if they were going to have their kid do ""gay hobbies"". When asked what she ment by gay hobbies, she clarified by saying jazz-tap and interior design. One does MMA, the other enjoys fly-fishing, but if it isn't a stereotype, Darth Potter doesn't believe a gay person can enjoy it.

And finally, for her grand finale, (drumroll) when told that she was being inappropriate, asked if they were mad at her, or just upset that Aretha Franklin died.

Again, she did all of this in just over an hour and a half. Luckily, my friends are probably the most patient people in the world, and afterwards found to entire situation to be hilarious (though the surrogate was ready to cut a bitch). They had been hearing stories about her for years, and still can't believe that a single person can be that much of a hot mess.

My nMom just told me she used that money to buy her current house. I’m beyond angry right now. This is the same woman who has stressed NOTHING in life is more important than getting money. The woman who constantly belittles me for not spending all my money on frivolous shit. 

On a side note- Is there anything I can do? I have no ability to GET the money, and no other adult figure in my life who can help me to do so. I’m afraid my options are limited as i’m not a legal adult in my province until I am 19 and nobody believes in her abuse. Hell sometimes I don’t even believe it.

293,"First time mom, MIL can't handle ""no"".",GrimJelly,0,157,792,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536045574.0,9ctdh2,"This is my first post here, but I've spent hours reading all your posts! I've also read the rules about a hundred times, to make sure I don't mess anything up and get myself temp banned by accident, so if I do/say something wrong I honestly don't mean to. I'll also try to keep this as organized as I can, but a lot of this jumps around and relates to each other. 

This is also extremely long, and I'm sorry, but stick around if you want to experience my frustrations I have with my MIL. 

I'll preface this with some back story D(ear)F and I have only been together for just over 15 months. We also have a 4 month old son together (scandalous, I know). I met DF at work, we've worked together for going on 5 years, and always had kind of a ""bust your balls"" type of relationship. Keep in mind, that DF is a fairly socially anxious person, and I'm his first serious relationship. We're both in our twenties. I also used to volunteer with his mom, but didn't put two and two together until closer to us developing a romantic relationship. From the very first time I met MIL, volunteering with her, I thought she was a lovely woman. This continued for the first couple of months into our relationship. I now realize that the only reason I thought she was great was because she stayed at arm's length. 

My dad has always been very inclusive of DF. They have very similar interests, and a lot of the time when all of us are together I usually get left out of conversation (because I have no idea what they're talking about and therefore no input), and as annoying as that can get, it's really nice to see Dad being friends with the man I'm marrying. I truly feel like Dad has welcomed DF into the family with open arms. The same cannot be said for MIL. Within the first six months or so of being with DF, Dad had made every attempt to get to know him, be it having dinner with us, inviting him over for movie nights, taking us out to special events. DF even spent Christmas Eve (which is very important to my family) with us and got to partake in our Christmas Morning/day shenanigans. The only dinners I had ever had with the IL's was a birthday dinner for DF and a Christmas Eve dinner before heading to my family's get together. Keep in mind, by the time his birthday had rolled around we had been together for over 5 months. I was invited to one dinner, in a 5 month relationship.

By this point, I felt like his parents weren't being very welcoming of me. MIL was very strict on the ""no spending the night"" rule, even though he was an adult and paid them rent. She would text very late in the night ocassionally, asking when I was going home, when half the time she didn't even realize I was there to begin with. I eventually brought up to DF that I felt like they just didn't want to get to know me, and he responded by saying they just thought I was shy, and that's why I was never invited to come around. I guess that's in part DF's fault, because he could have just as easily said ""is it okay if I bring OP?"", but oh well. Up until this point I really didn't have any real issues with my MIL, other than feeling kind of alienated by her. 

That is until, we discovered I was pregnant VERY early in our relationship. DF, being the upstanding guy that he is, stepped up and immediately started filling his role of ""dad"". He was and continues to be an amazing father to our son. We told Dad fairly early on, shortly after my first sonogram, and he took it really well. I'm a young mom, I'm only 20, so I expected Dad to be disappointed or upset, especially when I had only been with DF for less than 4 months at this point. But he was excited instead! Great! DF decided that he wanted to wait a little while to tell his parents, because he feared they wouldn't take it as well as Dad did. Spoiler alert, he was right. 

Three weeks after we tell Dad, he finally works up the courage to tell his parents. He asks me if he can do it alone, because he doesn't want to subject me to a potential blow up from his mother (this should have been a BIG red flag). He spends several hours anxiously watching TV with them, texting me with promises of ""next commercial break"" when I started getting impatient. Eventually he spills the beans. His dad nervously laughed. His mom went to the sink, accidentally broke a mug, went out to have a smoke, came back in and told him I wasn't welcome around the house for a little while. THIS is where shit hits the fan. 

Over the course of the next couple weeks, MIL has taken it upon herself to try and convince DF that we shouldn't move in together. In her mind, DF should live at home with them, let me either get a place on my own or live with Dad and raise the baby pretty much by myself for the first two years, while DF ""saves money"" and goes to school. DF of course tells her no, but not in a direct enough way, leaving avenues open to try and convince him. She tells him that she would like to have a conversation with me to try and explain to me why moving in together is a bad idea. By this point pregnancy hormones are starting to take affect and I get irritable about this. I say I don't want a conversation, she needs to just accept that we're not doing it her way and comes to terms. Conveniently, a few days later she tells DF that she's changed her mind on the conversation bit, because I'm obviously stuck in my ways. 

Fast forward to October of last year, DF's birthday rolls around. And I'm finally invited to a family outing. I agree to go, as long as DF promises me that I won't be backed into a corner and reprimanded about my life decisions. I'm high stress, we've just had an ultrasound and walked back in the rain. I would like to have a relationship with his parents that don't involve me being treated like a child. He promises me that she's dropped it. We get to his parents' house, and sit down waiting for her to come in from outside. His dad comes in first, and to lighten the mood says ""don't worry, we're just going to have a good meal, no conversation!"". I breathe finally, and then enter MIL. The first thing out of her mouth is ""we need to have a conversation."". She continues to scold me, telling me that I'm not ready for this and I've made a difficult choice for myself, while I sit silently fuming. The rest of dinner goes off without a hitch. I don't see them for a prolonged period of time until Christmas. 

Between October and December, we have our anatomy scan. We find out that we're having a boy, and excitedly announce the gender and his name on our Facebook. A short while later, I find out MIL has taken my sonogram photo and posted it on her Facebook without asking. I'll admit, this bothered me. I feel like this was a very intimate thing for DF and I to share with family and close friends, and that we should have at least been asked. DF wasn't even tagged, so people were commenting asking if it was his or SIL's. I let this slide, and didn't even bring it up to DF because at least she was starting to get on board with being a grandma. 

Shortly after this we find out that there is potentially something wrong with our DS's heart. We had to see a cardiologist for another ultrasound. When DF mentioned this to her, she comforted him, never asking how I was doing, or offering me any kind of support. I truly felt like nothing but an incubator for a grandchild she didn't even want at first. Not long after we had the ultrasound and were told everything was fine she made an offhand remark about how she never had an ultrasounds with SIL and she was fine, and that unnecessary ultrasounds are bad for baby. 

Months go by, and nothing really significant happens. She does some weird things like offering to take pictures while I give birth (she's a terrible photographer and also that's super uncomfortable), getting upset when DF and I make it clear that no one is to be waiting at the hospital for us while I have him, asking to join us to a midwife appointment, and trying to plan a ""grandma shower"" for herself, but all in all the rest of my pregnancy went by without much issue. 

Fast forward to late April, DS is born, and has just been laid on my chest. DF and I spend some time getting to know him, and DF eventually asks if he can text our parents to announce his arrival. I agree as long as he lets everyone know to give us at least an hour before showing up, so we can have some bonding time. IL's show up within ten minutes. So I tell Dad he can go ahead and come see him too. This honestly doesn't bother me a whole bunch, because DS is the first and only grandchild. I understand it's very exciting. Things continue to go well until DS is four weeks old, with weekly visits to IL's. 

Up until this point MIL had made backhanded offers at babysitting, but had never worded it in a way of ""you can feel free to leave him with me if you ever need to"" and instead was always ""oh you just leave him with me. You don't need to take him to do [insert activity here]"". When we expressed that we were going to be taking him to the zoo eventually she added her two cents by saying ""you're not taking him to a zoo. They're awful."" And while I understand her views on them, don't tell me what to do with my own kid. 

When DS turns a month old, we finally let MIL have a crack at babysitting. Being a FTM I was extremely anxious and reluctant to leave my exclusively breastfed baby, so we agreed to let MIL and FIL watch him while DF and I napped upstairs. She asked us to bring our stroller for him, saying it's just to rock him if he gets fussy. I say okay, asking DF to make a note to her that I don't want him going on walks without me yet. We arrive at their house, DF reminds her as I had requested and she immediately gets CBF. 

""Oh, FIL isn't going to be happy. He just wants to take DS for a walk."" 

I reply very politely that I'm not ready yet, and I would prefer him to stay close by me. 

""I would never let anything happen to him!"" 

I meet her with a more solid ""no"". 

Later that evening, after I never ended up napping because I was anxious about her potentially ignoring my boundaries, she asks me if we can take DS to go meet her friend. Now, I'm a pretty easy going person, I like to think. But I just don't see any reason that my son would have to meet his Nana's friend at just a month old. She's a stranger to me, there are germs, and I'm not a fan of passing him around to be held by just whoever. DF agrees before I can say anything, but luckily plans fall through and he doesn't meet this woman. 

This, however, made me realize that she had most likely made plans to take DS to this woman's house while we stayed home, and when I said no and foiled her plans, she got upset and manipulative. The beginning of her second major offence. 

Fast forward another month, we've been told that we need to leave our apartment for two weeks or so while our landlord fixes a pretty major leak. MIL graciously offers us a bedroom, and we take it as Dad's house is small. Before we can leave, we need to move everything from one end of our house to the other end. DF works full-time, so I take on the job mostly by myself. Dad helps me a bit, but eventually has to leave. DS is being particularly difficult, and I'm running out of time, so I ask MIL to come watch him while I power away at it. She asks if she can take him for a walk, I reluctantly agree, as long is it doesn't stray too far out of my neighborhood, and he stays in his seat so he can hopefully nap. She takes him for a half hour walk, and when she gets back I notice his carseat straps aren't in the same spot I buckled him (I'm super anal about this). I ask if she had him out of the seat and she admits she has, claiming she needs her baby snuggles. She says she walked by aforementioned friends house just to show him off, never alluding to the fact that he had been held. She had been reminded on multiple occasions before not to pass DS off to random people, so she was well aware of this rule. Several hours later I'm tagged in a Facebook post of this woman I've never met holding my baby. I, again, let it slide after DF asks me too because I didn't explicitly warn her no visits before hand. 

Now my relationship with her has started to strain. I feel like my boundaries and rules are being thrown out the window as soon as I'm not around to enforce them, and this makes it difficult for me to trust her babysitting. DF convinces me not to bring anything up for his sake.

This is where we come to the big and current issue, and for anyone still reading, thank you very much! 

Recently, I've noticed that people are posting way too many pictures of DS on their social media, myself included. He was set as multiple people's cover and profile pictures, and being shared carelessly. I decided that I wasn't comfortable with this anymore, locked my own social media up very tightly, and asked everyone to please be mindful of their posting habits regarding DS. I shared an infographic about parents and relatives oversharing a child's life and the dangers it could pose, and just asked that everyone keep his safety in mind. I then made a promise to myself to not post him on social media nearly as often (and have mostly kept good on that). Everyone else received this request very well, I got some apologies that I didn't feel were necessary, as I wasn't really angry at anyone. MIL, the main culprit of this, however, ignored it. 

Later that week, we visited the IL's with DS, and I casually bring up over dinner the post I'd shared. I find a way to gently incorporate it into conversation so she doesn't feel like I'm attacking her. I am met with FIL saying ""if you're so scared of social media, you shouldn't be on it to begin with"". Now up until this point FIL is not the one I've had an issue with. He's been a pretty agreeable guy, so this statement throws me for a loop. I explain that I know each and every person on my social media, and that I also know that my privacy settings are very tight. MIL proceeds to throw a miniature fit, giving me attitude about how she has family that she likes to share with. DF is giving me that look, so I let the conversation fizzle out. MIL must have seen this as a surrender, as she pulls her phone out to snap some photos of DS. Fifteen minutes after we leave their house, these pictures are posted. 

At this point I'm irate. There's no other word to explain it. I have made my discomforts clear, asked that MIL be mindful, and was essentially told no, while she did the very thing I had just said no to right in front of me. I give DF a warning that I am no longer biting my tongue, and send her a message. I very politely explain that I'm not happy, that even if it seems silly to her, I am the mother to DS and my rules need to be respected. I offer to speak to her and find a compromise, but that she can't tell me no just because she doesn't agree. She leaves me on read, attempts to call DF, and when he doesn't answer her, messages me back saying along the lines of ""I'm sorry, but you're being ridiculous and I won't listen to you."" She tells me I'm being anxious for no reason and that we need to have a conversation face to face. My blood is now boiling and I can feel the silver tongue coming out, so for the betterment of everyone, I ignore her. The next morning once I've calmed down, I send her another message saying that I didn't think we needed to discuss this further, I was putting my foot down and that was that. 

She leaves me on read and again calls DF demanding he go over so she can grovel about this to him and tell him he needs to talk to me. For the next two weeks this same scenario happens again and again, with DF asking me to reach out and try to talk to her, MIL blatantly ignoring me, and then calling DF crying that I'm being unreasonable. Even SIL sent DF a text stating how disrespectful I was being by telling her no. I tried a total of three times to be polite and respectful and offer a conversation and was ignored each time. DF and I ended up fighting a lot about it, bringing us very close to a break up because he refused to also put his foot down and tell her she needed to listen to me, and instead tried to play a neutral field. In this time MIL continues taking photos from my page and posting them on her own, including works from an aspiring photographer friend of mine, which she had cropped me out of (which aside from just being petty, she had discredited the photographer's work). She tries multiple times to get DF to bring DS over without me, and otherwise just ignores my existence. 

Finally things seem to calm down, DF begs me to forget about it, saying that MIL will be nervous to go against my wishes now because I've made such a stink about this. I changed my settings so she could no longer see any of my posts and agree to go to dinner so she can see DS. A few days after this, I post DS's 4 month sticker photo (yes, I'm that mom) on Instagram.  Within half an hour she has somehow managed to get the picture and post it herself. I'm not sure how as she doesn't have instagram and DF didn't send it to her. My best bet is SIL, who was following me, screenshotted it and sent it to her. 

Now, this probably would not have bothered me IF she had not fought me so hard on the issue before. Throughout this whole thing I've realized that she takes the ""proud grandma"" thing way too far, and is really just using DS as a way to garner attention for herself. I refuse to let my child be a showboat, and obviously I have not gotten through to her, so I message her one last time, this time less than nice. I very bluntly tell her she needs to stop, she's been told multiple times, and this is non negotiable. She flat out tells me I'm being silly and controlling, that I'm too much to handle and that she won't be stopping. That I just need to trust her. I respond with ""how can I trust you if you can't even respect a simple boundary?"" And I'm left on read. She then shares a very obvious post about me on Facebook (keep in mind this is a full grown adult woman), and when I make a comment on it, I am promptly deleted all together. 

Cue more fighting with DF, feeling like I'm on my own in this whole thing, threats of leaving, and he finally sees how serious I am. Agrees to talk to her. He goes for a visit by himself, but the visit is crashed by SIL, so he arranges another visit to clear this up. That was today. 

He sends a text this morning that very clearly states that from now on she doesn't get to say no to me when it involves DS. I need to be listened to, and that is that. He says we'll be coming for a visit today like she wanted, but that there was to be no arguing her case, this was the end of it and she needed to accept that or she would not be seeing DS for a long time. She calls him fighting it. 

During this phone call she manipulates him into making the decision to uninvite me so that they can discuss this further. She tells him she'll be awkward and uncomfortable until this is sorted out and doesn't want to be in that position. No, no. She wants me to not be around so she can try to convince DF that I'm wrong. DF tells me this and says he is taking DS without me. Another fight ensues, because I feel like this is just giving her what she wants. It ends when I agree to let DS go under the pretense that DF promises me that he will be firm and tell her she needs to stop. He was only going to be gone for an hour or so to have a conversation with her. An hour turned into two and a half, with them going out for dinner. 

When DF got home, he promised me everything was done. She had said some things but eventually agreed because she realized she wouldn't get to see DS as frequently. 

I honestly really do not feel like this whole thing is over though and I'm worried about her trying to take legal action against it now. This woman very obviously cannot take no for an answer, and I wouldn't put something like that past her. And at the end of this whole thing, it isn't even about the pictures anymore. It's about the fact that I asked a very simple rule be followed, and it turned into an almost month long battle just because she didn't agree. 

To everyone who reads this whole thing, I really appreciate it! It's been an uphill battle with her and I haven't had many resources to get it off my chest so it feels really good to let all the pent up frustrations out somewhere. 

TL;DR- Crazy MIL is told she isn't allowed to do something regarding DS anymore and throws a month long shit fit about it, pretending I don't exist all while behaving like a child who's had her favorite toy taken away.

294,Learning what love feels like.,loreike,0,3,11,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536087593.0,9cymrn,"Spinning off a ""what narcs say"" thread, yes:
Learning what love feels like is hard especially when your loved one has N-parents and is only halfway done working on his spine.  

He's so conditioned to stand up for family, oir no matter what they do or say to others, or how inconsiderate etc. they are.  I said for example your mom is out of line expecting us to cancel our friends visit we are expecting to come for the weekend, because she wants us to attend an improptu dinner.  Then - I get screamed at ""DON""T YOU BAD MOUTH MY MOM!!!!!"".  
Same thing from SIL1 SIL2, if I say something like, ""that thing your mom is putting together is not going to work"". then I get something like ""NO ONE ASKED YOU!!!!"". And DH jumps on their side gnashing his teeth along with the two sisters he refers to as ""the wolves"" and will start in on the ""and DON""T YOU BAD MOUTH MY MOM!!!!!

I told them all once, you know what, common law DH and I have been together 20 years she's my mom my too.  

But DH at least was trying to teach me to grey-rocking for years.  He'd say,""When we're there for dinner - can't you just be quiet and not say anything?""  

I always thought that was absurd, why would I go somewhere and then act like I'm in high-school detention?  Because JUSTnomil /  family oey.

But now I can grey-rock the shit out of MIL's the shenanigans and I don't even have to go - to the concert for tribute to artist I've never listen too.

Oh, even though concert is 3 days after DH's upcoming birthday there  was no mention of, ""we'll get your ticket for you since it's your birthday and this is my idea."" Nope. And we live out of town and the ticket office is 10 min from their place but not only is the birthday not mentioned she made it DH's responsibility to buy all the tickets, for them, their 4 friends, and throws in as we walk out the door, ""and remember to buy tickets for your sisters!!!

DH was so ticked off because the sisters never have money to apy back anything, even outright small loans. So he didn't buy them for 3 weeks, would not respond to the calls and messages of  ,""remember to get those tickets..."","" it's getting late, the good seats will be gone."" So eventually because the on-line system is such a pain we go to the actual venue and buy the tix on my credit card. Mom leaves message , ""rememeber I only want 6 tickets"". As in, not your sisters, you sort that out.  Total slow burn.
Lately, when we're in the city he'll take a short cut through his old neighbourhood, drive right past their street and says nothing.  I also stay silent.  
Fortunately, (for MIL) she coughed up the money for all the tickets except his.  Oh, and she was really SAD to hear I wqsn't oming.  That's right, I won't expose myself to her or ""the wolves"", unnecessarily, and the concert is on a Monday night and we live 1 1/2 hours away so - I have to get to bed on time for work. At least DH didn't in the least try to get me to go.  Whew.

I had to call her and the first thing she said after telling me he has sleeping pills was that it was an accident because he wouldn’t do that to her, that he knew it was selfish. I’m 10 hours away in the probationary period of a new job, and so scared to even attempt to go back because I can’t stomach the thought of seeing anyone else in the family. I’ve already gotten comments saying maybe this will be what makes our family whole again. That this is what will make me talk to my nmom again. I know they have been mostly hearing her side because once my sister or I opened our mouths we got silence and once we asked for an apology they all stopped talking to us. I guess it’s more like they cut contact with us. I don’t know how to handle this. I feel like it’s my fault. I feel like me leaving did this to him.

Basically i'm very good at reading when others are unhappy with me.  It makes me anxious and sers off the alarm bells.  Because growing up it was the silent treatment before the storm. Husband has his moments but nothing (not even close) like what I experienced from my malignant NParent. 

Anyway, he told me why he was annoyed with me.  He had every right to those feelings and 
I wish i could say I handled it well but I didnt.  I started thinkjng about what I do for him and everyone else and basically went into poor me vicitim mode / hulk smash mode. 

This escalated the conflict and there were some hurtful things said. 

So, I came here to vent about him how he is so dismissive of my needs related to my ADHD and I ended up reading someone elses post here that made me realise I was acting just like my malignant NParent and my histronic NParent.  So I apologized to husband for my overreaction and way I handled his critisism.  

I do have ADHD and am also an Aspie, but that doesnt mean that Im not accountable to others for my word and actions.

299,"JUSTNOMOM would prefer to risk my newborn getting the flu and dying, than to risk suffering flu symptoms herself.",oxytocindosin,0,55,156,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536112797.0,9d1yrb,"I wasn’t quite sure where to post this. I posted previously on r/babybumps about the fact that my mom was refusing to get the flu shot before meeting my soon-to-be-born baby (I am currently 34 weeks pregnant). Posted on this sub about how my justnomom is insistent on being in the delivery room (SPOILER ALERT hell no she won’t be) a week or so ago. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion about everything and that includes vaccines; but this is my child who I must protect. I personally believe in vaccinating, and a flu shot is required if you are going to be spending any amount of time with my newborn (especially considering that we’ve now entered flu season).

Long story short, I reminded my mom that she needed a flu shot and tdap in order to meet the baby; she flipped. She has never believed in the flu shot or any vaccinations for that matter. When I started getting the flu shot as an adult, she accused me of being a “poser” (because I work at a healthcare facility that obviously promotes the flu shot) (my mom calls people “posers” to this day because she is apparently eternally 14 years old). But for some reason, she is convinced that the flu shot will give her an adverse reaction due to it possibly interacting with her psoriasis and thyroid medicines (I talked to a pharmacist friend about this and in many years of giving flu shots has never heard of such a thing; I also talked to my midwife about it in length, and she herself thinks my mom is being dramatic and avoiding the shot for selfish reasons.). She claims to have had an “extreme” reaction to the flu shot many years ago, and to that I call bullshit; I remember this time well, and she coincidentally got food poisoning after the shot. It was NOT from the flu shot. And even if it was, is it worth risking the health of an infant? Also, the flu shot is different every year, and if she did have a bad reaction one year, the likelihood of her having the same reaction this year is apparently slim to none. But I digress.

After much arguing (and this is all over text) over a course of days, my mom suddenly switched gears. “Okay! I’ll get it tomorrow”. I replied, “sounds good! Thank you for respecting my wishes. :) Because you were so adamant about being completely against it though, I’m gonna want to see a receipt please!!”. My last comment stemming from the fact that that was way too easy. Also, my mom has a lengthy history of compulsively lying. After I sent that text, radio silence.

The next day, I text her around 7pm asking if she had in fact got the shot. Crickets.

I’m a night owl, so I was still up the following morning at 2am. After talking to my partner, he urged me to send the text I was wanting to, saying, *“Okay, if I were to take as long as you’ve been taking to reply to your texts, I would have gotten at least one “???” text from you by now. Can you answer my question about the mandatory vaccine you need to get in order to meet your granddaughter?”.* 

**90% of the time I don’t reply to her within two hours, she will send multiple texts consisting of question marks and/or threats to call the police to do a “wellness check” on me, etc (note: I’m a grown woman in her twenties with a full time job to suck up my time and often prevent me from instantly answering every single insignificant text I receive). My mom is known to stay up at all hours, and I don’t know anyone who is more attached to their phone. She was blatantly ignoring me. Also, I had a gut feeling she wouldn’t actually get the shot. The following text shows I was right.**

The next day, I woke up to this text from her:
*”I went to sleep early last night, so I only saw your messages this morning...
I never left the house yesterday, so I’m going today. 
I actually find it disrespectful that you are trying to demand a receipt?! 
Seriously? After everything that I’ve done for you-and continue to do-I don’t deserve that kind of rudeness. 
If I tell you going that I’m going to do something,  I’m going to do it. I’ve never given you any reason to doubt that. 
The fact that I was initially apprehensive about the flu shot does not negate the fact that I agreed to get one-for my granddaughters sake. 
I would appreciate it if you would treat me with a bit more kindness and consideration.”*

My reply:
”If you are going to continue to use the things you buy for me and do for me as leverage every time we have an argument or disagreement, I think it’s healthiest that you stop. I don’t know if you notice, but quite often you will say that statement “after all I’ve done for you”, always bring up things you’ve bought or done, any time we have a disagreement. You do it constantly. It makes it clear that your motive for doing these things definitely isn’t solely based in you wanting to help me.

I grew up with you being against the flu shot, I know how against it you have always been. When I told you that getting it was a requirement in order to meet [my baby], this was your reply:

“I’ve told you already, oxytocindosin, that I don’t get the flu shot-ever. 
The only time that I did-I got extremely sick-and it has proven to be safer for me NOT to get one. 
And you know, I rarely even get a cold, let alone, the flu. 
As I said, I will get the tdap shot before [my baby] is born.”

That statement alone is enough to justify my wanting a receipt. Just the fact that you didn’t even consider that the risk to her if she gets sick is death? But you were only thinking of the time you got a flu shot and coincidentally fell ill for a few days? It shows me where your head is (or at least was at the time) and sets off alarm bells in my “new Mom” brain. 

I’m glad that the article (or whatever it was, be it that or my insistence) was enough to sway you, but the fact that you don’t believe that a flu shot is a no brainer (regardless of the fact that I am about to have an infant that you will meet) is still very shocking to me. 

Yes, I want a receipt, and that has nothing to do with disrespecting you, but it does have everything to do with protecting my baby.”

I sent that three days ago, and still no reply from her to that one.

**Whenever I disagree with her on anything (especially when it comes to life decisions for me that don’t require her input whatsoever), she brings up “everything she’s done for me”. From merely keeping me alive during childhood, to the car seat she bought for my baby recently (that I definitely did not ask for and she knew I had planned on buying myself). I DO NOT ask my mom for financial help, because it always comes with a catch. I DO NOT ask her to buy my unborn child things. EVER. EVEREVEREVER. But she continues to do so, so she feels I have a reason to owe her my time and attention. This has always been our dynamic. It is so irritating. Because of course I appreciate the help, but I don’t fucking want it if it’s to be used against me doesn’t the road. From now on, officially, I will decline every time she tries to help me financially or otherwise down the road.**


JESUSSSS. Am I being unreasonable for wanting a receipt??? Like? Really considering going NC with her, because she truly drives me crazy. I love her because she’s my mom, but the more I learn about narcissistic personalities (I’ve done some posting on r/raisedbynarcissists about her after recently realizing she has one of these personalities), the more it’s seeming like the best thing to do is cut her out. At least until she is willing to get help (if I even suggest therapy to her, she’ll say the classic “I don’t need therapy. YOU need therapy” kind of BS). We don’t ever have healthy interactions and she makes my skin crawl. It’s endlessly frustrating and heartbreaking for me, being pregnant and about to become a mom myself."
300,[RANT] NMom and NSis showed up to my home after I went NC with them,sexyhappyunicorn,0,180,1957,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536075650.0,9cwre1,"Yesterday I hosted the family Labor Day celebration at my home. 


Usually it’s at my parent’s house but my NMom and Dad are separated so no one wanted to go to their house. My NMom and NSis live there and my Dad is staying with me until their divorce is finalized.


For the first time in a long time all of my local family showed up. Most of them refuse to come to family events (except funerals) because they don’t want to deal with my NMom. 



We were having a great time. Everything was stress free. 



Then my NMom and NSis walk in the gate to my backyard. My heart sank immediately.



Everyone goes silent. A few of my relatives run inside the house because they didn’t want to deal with her or NSis. My Aunt who records all family events turns the camera to them.



My NMom yells at me about how inconsiderate it was to exclude them, how much I must really hate her and my NSis, how jealous of them I am,  how she hates coming to my house because it’s always so “sterile” and she’s afraid to touch anything or sit anywhere. 



I cut her off at that point and tell her neither of them are welcome and they need to go before I call the police (my Dad has a restraining order against my NMom). They head to the gate but not before she had to get the final word. 



**She tells me she read the e-mail I sent to her about cutting off all contact. She says “I’m offended by you and how you say I’ve treated you. All I’ve ever done is try to love you and you’re unlovable. How is that my fault? He’s (she pointed to my Dad) unlovable too. My online therapist says you’re both social rapists and terrible people!”**



I shrugged my shoulders and responded “of course we are. Nothing is ever your fault. I abused myself all those years. And if you truly feel that way about us then leave and never come back here. I don’t want you to feel socially raped.”



**Her response was “I had to come since you changed all your phone numbers, I can’t reach you at work, your Dad got that restraining order on me and any e-mails I send to you come back with a message that you’re not taking my e-mails and not to contact you. I knew you’d be here so I came to tell you and him (she pointed at my Dad) I’m done with you both. If you two don’t want me to contact you anymore then I won’t. Let’s see how good your life is without me. You’re not welcome at my house ever again. I don’t need either of you.”**



I tell her “I’m good with that. Have a nice life.”



When they’re almost at the car my NSis comes back and yells to my Dad “you’ll never see your grandkids again.” My father points to my NSis’ ex-husband who says “they’re here with me. They’re inside the house playing video games. He’ll see them plenty.”



My NSis kicks over 2 of my potted cactus plants, gets scratched by the needles then tripped by the first pot she kicked over. She gets up then runs to the car crying.



We all  try not to laugh since it was so comically dramatic but it was very hard not to so we laughed.




I hope I don’t see or hear from either of them anytime soon. I still feel good about going NC with both of them. Best decision I’ve made ever. 



**Thanks to everyone on here who sent me encouraging PMs after going NC with them. The positive support has been overwhelmingly awesome. There’s comfort knowing that I’m not alone and I can help others not feel so alone since we’re all going through the same things.**"
301,"MIL calls grandbaby ""the b*stard""",Greeneggsandspam555,0,73,2269,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536099426.0,9d0b55,"I can remember the exact day I decided I would never let MIL take care of my future kids.  This was light years before I had even thought of marrying DH.  I was probably eighteen at the time.  But, for context I'm going to have to back up even more (thanks for baring with me).

As far as most people know, DH has two siblings.  BIL and SIL3.  When I started dating him, I only knew of those two siblings.  Pretty much all of the other family friends only knew of those two siblings.  It was probably a couple of months into the relationship before DH revealed that he had two older sisters.  SIL1 is completely no contact with MIL (for absolutely solid reasons I can talk about in another post for anyone who is interested). SIL2 was no contact up until a few years ago when she needed someone who could babysit for custody purposes.  Obviously this put her as the ultimate black sheep of the remaining siblings (in a past post I mentioned that MIL referred to her as ""not really my child""), and MIL reveled in having the leverage of regularly babysitting SIL's  daughter, my dear niece (DN).  

I went over to visit while MIL was babysitting, and I immediately fell in love.  DN had to be around 3 at the time.  I excused myself from the boring adults and went to run around with DN in the backyard.  I also witnessed MIL cackling gleefully as she gave DN copious amounts of sweets and soda, loudly proclaiming ""You mommy would be SO MAD when she finds out I'm doing this."" But the icing on the Just No cake, was that MIL lead everyone in jokingly calling her ""litle bastard"" because, LOL, SIL2 had her out of wedlock so she technically IS a bastard.  Isn't' that freaking hilarious?  That's when I promised myself MIL was never going to babysit any of my kids.  

Years later I had the privilege of actually meeting and hanging out with SIL2. She is awesome because she is out of the FOG and is happy to talk frankly about MIL.  I casually mentioned that watching MIL babysit DN made me decide that she would never babysit my kids (I don't even have kids, but I have no doubts about this and I've made it crystal clear to DH).  SIL asked, ""oh, yeah, because of the sugar?"" 

I replied, ""no, because she was always calling DN 'the bastard'.""

It turns out SIL2 had no idea.  I actually felt really bad that I brought it up, because she had already stopped letting MIL babysit, and it obviously really hurt her feelings.  She is an amazing mom and worked incredibly hard to build an awesome career while supporting DN.  MIL still talks crap about DN. When my mom met DN she was surprised that she was so smart and well behaved because MIL portrays her as kind of a ""wild child"".  I had the privilege of babysitting her for a couple of days while I was in town (somehow without calling her any names or loading her up on sugar),  and I can tell you she is a freaking angel child and anyone who says differently can fight me.

302,I think my MIL just crossed the line between MildlyNO to JustNO...,anonymity117,0,22,74,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536027922.0,9crlqq,"If this still belongs in r/Mildlynomil please let me know so I can move it there.  This will be long so TL;DR at the bottom.

I've been posting in r/Justnofil about my FIL and r/JUSTNOFAMILY about my SIL.  All throughout I've always maintained that my MIL is a MildlyNo and at worst an enabler of the abuse FIL and SIL have inflicted on my DH, since she doesn't seem as crazy as many of JNMILs I've read here.

Well, an episode last night might have changed all that, but I'm still not 100% certain so I thought I'd ask here.

MIL and FIL married when MIL was 19.  She was in college, pretty, popular with the boys, all that.  But she fell in love with FIL who convinced her to drop out and marry.  She had SIL when she was 20, then DH 4 years later.

The marriage was intensely volatile.  FIL and MIL argued often, and MIL caught FIL cheating on her with different women over the years.  The final straw was when he defrauded MIL, her sister, and SIL of their inheritance/savings, that he is still paying back to his day, almost 25 years later.  She packed her bags, said not a word of goodbye to her kids, and just went back to her dad's house.

DH was 11.

To say it devastated him is an understatement.  His grades plummeted.  MIL took to drinking until she passes out.  She even resorted to violently beating DH's back with a flip flop when he refused to do his homework, all while intoxicated.  SIL had to pull her off DH to get her to stop.

DH was left under the care of FIL until the day we married, so FIL controlled every aspect of his life by that point.  His education, his college course, his friendships, everything.  DH was called stupid, slow, usesless.  When he complained to MIL, she shrugged it off and told him to just grin and bear it, and to respect his dad nonetheless.

That was his norm.

Last night, it all came to a head.  FIL had fallen and sprained his knee, plus a water incident at his house made FIL call DH early morning screaming.  DH was obviously drained from all this, and asked MIL to help him care for FIL.  By the way, we live in Southeast Asia so not much of elderly care is done by the government.

She explodes and points the finger at me and my parents, saying we put him up to this, insisting that it's unreasonable to ask her and SIL to contribute in any way.  Partly true, since we did tell DH that he can't be expected to shoulder all of their care simply because he's human.  She then goes into a tirade on how DH should be defending her, and is blaming me and my folks for turning her son against her.

DH was reduced to tears after that conversation.

**TL;DR: DH asks MIL for help in caring for his injured but abusive dad.  She explodes and blames my parents and me for turning her son against her.  Has she crossed the line from MildlyNO to JustNO?**"
303,The nightmare that is my father.,yourmumslefttoe,0,3,4,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536124790.0,9d3c9d,"My father has always placed himself as his first priority. Not caring how his actions effect other. 18 years ago he left his first child and all of his family behind and moved to china ""to be with my mother"". The thing is, my mother begged to stay in America. I think becoming an American is part of the reason she agreed to marrying a man 14 years older then herself. My father's real reason in moving to china was for the attention he as a white guy in china gets. 
Cut to about 15 years later. My mother got a job and became independent ie. Didnt feed his ego by relying on him. He cheated on her. They got a divorce. My father now at the age of 57 has a 20 year old thai wife who can barley speak English and is clearly using him for financial reasons. I wouldn't be as angered by this if his children were all adults fending for themselves but I'm 16 and I have 2 younger sisters and we're all being neglected because he values getting laid more then his children. He is spending money he dose not have on his wife while his children survive on top ramen. 
Me and my sister had to constantly ask for chairs to do school work on for over a month and he ends up buying us 5 dollar used chairs off the internet. This is totally fine because financially we're in a tough spot. The problem is that he then turns around and drops 60 bucks on a vanity for his wife because she makes a mess on the bathroom counter when doing her makeup and dosen't want to clean up.
He left us in a foreign country(America) with an alcoholic and borderline insane aunt for 5 months while he was vacationing in Vietnam, Thailand and Hong kong with his wife.
He is overly defensive, can take 0 criticism and has a short temper which has led him to throwing me into a  wall because I called him a irresponsible parent. He once kicked my then 14 year old sister out on the streets of Bangkok at night because she called him a bad father. 
I am angry at and feel bad for him at the same time because I know he will die a lonely old man with all of his children hating him and his wife he cherished so much leaving him once he's too old to take care of her. Despite the fact that he is the only person to blame for his grim future, one can't help but pity him.
I now can't decide if I should just ignore him untill I turn 18 and get kicked out then disowning him as my father and never speaking to him again or if I should try to salvage what's left of our family resulting in more yelling matches,emotional and physical abuse with maybe a chance of everything ending up ok?

Wouldn’t even be mad if it wasn’t for the fact that I’m the one who pays all the bills and makes sure the kids have what they need. I’m great with money. Don’t push your sons flaws on to me lady! Of course me expecting him to pay the arrears he got us into is completely irrational??

306,Overly gift-giving MIL being obsessive about us using her gifts??,shartweekondvd,0,48,56,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536022814.0,9cqzpj,"Hey, LTL;FTP; acronym acronym

So my boyfriend and I just moved in together at the beginning of July. His mom (BMIL) has always been *relatively* nice and friendly to me and almost ALWAYS gives me small gifts that she ""just had laying around"" or ""saw and she thought of me/us"" whenever she/we visits (which is only a few times a year because she use to live a ways away). I say relatively because she still makes snide comments about our apartment choice (""dangerous, shabby, we can afford better""--despite us wanting to aggressively pay off our debts so we're okay with living cheaply), the fact that we're moving in/sleeping in the same bed before marriage, what I'm wearing if we go out to eat on Sundays (she thinks one should always dress up on Sundays regardless? Idk), etc. I mean she can be like, middle aged southern lady style too much, but that's how some of my family is so I can deal. I just change the subject or make a joke to definitely shut down the conversation but also without being too rude.

Anyway whenever she gave me stuff, which was jewelry like 75% of the time, I would always try to wear it next time I see her because I know how nice of a feeling that is (seeing someone use/like your gift). It's rarely 'my style' but again, I'm trying to be nice and I could tell she appreciated it.

So now we live much closer to her and boyfriend's dad since moving in July. Not like next door, but close enough for her to visit a bit too often for my taste TBH. 

But now it's an issue because she A) rarely sees me wearing her jewelry because she comes by unexpectedly really often and B) she complained that we didn't have any of the trinkets (the other 25% of gifts) out in the open in our new apartment. (And slightly irrelevant C) I have to hear her small comments more frequently than before).

At first she just made side comments about it when we were moving in, but now she is asking straight up where ""that cute so-and-such thing is"".

Now, keep in mind none of this is my/our style. I'm talking like, a little cutesy plaque with a freakish looking  cat on it with cat pawprints throughout, with an engraving that says ""pray for me, my girlfriend is Irish"" (my ancestry is Irish, but I'm only 1/4 and don't identify as Irish, she just heard once that my family is and bought this I guess). It's all like... Stuff you would find either in the clearance at a Hallmark store 15 years ago (which I think is likely the case knowing her) or in those mail order magazines my grandmom used to get.

She's also a quilter and made us a quilt. Now, I totally respect the amount of time, money, and energy that goes into quilting. But they're just rarely if ever aesthetically appealing to me. Plus the one she made is not only particularly ugly but also isn't particularly warm, it's just... fabric? Idk. She also tried to give us the most hideous curtains ever made by man but I flat out rejected those and lied saying we had already ordered some. I took a picture of them before I'll try and find it because I just got a new phone. They had sequins on them y'all. Sequins. On curtains. For adults. What. 

As it turns out, evidently the last time she visited was the last straw because we didn't have the quilt on our bed. The next time boyfriend was at BMIL's house, she said that it really hurt her feelings that it wasn't on the bed (but it was folded nicely and slung on the back of our armchair in the living room!!) and that we didn't have any of her ""decorations"" out (again, these aren't decorations, they are knick knacks at best). She also told him that it hurt her feelings that I wasn't wearing any of the jewelry anymore but was instead opting for ""crap from Target"". Now, admittedly I do get a fair amount of my jewelry from Target. But firstly, my style is really simple, petite gold jewelry... and that exclusively. And secondly, all of the stuff she gets me is from her sister's jewelry MLM thing (which she gets for free!!!) and it is shitty quality... Target jewelry is still leagues better than what she gives me. Anyway, she just went on a mini tirade about everything and my boyfriend was just a bit too diplomatic about it ""oh we haven't finished unpacking"", ""shartweek is still trying to figure out where she wants everything to go"", etc. 

So anyway sorry this got long, but my question is what to do about this. I almost wish that she was screaming/crying/a complete wacko about all this like we see a lot of the time on here, but instead is just saying ""how much it hurts her feelings"" and is a relatively otherwise tolerable woman... Or at least was, because I'm starting to get worried about a ""death by a thousand cuts"" with all her comments I'm getting more and more frequently now. And this is all even harder since my boyfriend and I have every intention of marrying, so I don't want this bridge to burn before it's even built. Any suggestions y'all?"
307,MIL and Sonsband (DH) get Divorced !,plasticcup99473,0,2,3,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536156340.0,9d6ux0,"Quick Backstory. MIL has been using DH as her emotional support system (aka surrogate husband) while her and FIL have marital issues. MIL calls DH to talk badly about FIL and all of the problems they are having. MIL has been playing the victim as to why their marriage isn't working out. DH has been her sonsband for as long as I can remember. 

But then something beautiful happened. Last night MIL calls DH and APOLOGIZES to DH for using him as her emotional support system. She tells DH she shouldn't have used him like that and she is sorry. I have never seen DH show his shiny spine to her (since she is fragile and hurting from a broken marriage) & I couldn't believe my ears when I heard this, DH says, ""Thank you for the apology. Although I accept it, the person you really owe the apology to is FIL."" 

MIL then starts to back track a bit, & says, ""but you never wanted a relationship with FIL anyways."" 

DH, ""That's not the point. It doesn't matter whether I wanted one or not with him. I shouldn't have to get over the things he did to me, and on top of that now the things he has done to you. If FIL did to you what you have done to him (talking badly about FIL to DH), wouldn't you feel betrayed?"" 

MIL, ""Yeah I guess so.""

DH, ""Then don't you think you owe him an apology?"" 

MIL, ""I will think about it."" 

 A few things to add here, DH tells her that because she has been using him as her emotional support, she has put hers and DH relationship above DH and FIL, and he is not okay with it. DH goes as far as telling her that she has put hers and his relationship above MIL and FIL. 

DH tells me the whole conversation and wow, I have to say I am really proud of him :') . He also goes on to say that he knows FIL was not a good person growing up to their family, but he has changed a lot and he is trying really hard to have a relationship with him. DH even says he would like to hangout with FIL without MIL, because she is always dominating the conversation when they are together. DH says now that he sees what she was doing, and sees that she was very aware of what she was doing (parental triangulation), that he knows MIL is not 100% the victim and she isn't as innocent in their marriage as she has made herself seem.

If its not me its my brother or someone else. 
He talks over me, talks down to me, tells me to grow up and the abuse wasn't that bad (yet police and social services are still involved with my youngest brother) 
I recently lost my job and i was a nervous wreck at work, i made huge mistakes and was too scared to ask for help incase i got shouted at or talked down too. 
So i got depressed, ended up signing off and i couldnt even explain to my employer the real reason. So i got sacked.

Its given him more reason to pick on me, he says i bet everyone at work hated you and wanted you gone. Yet people at work seen him shouting at me like a child and said hes a horrible man.

He gives me no privacy and has come into my bedroom twice whilst I've been naked and told me nobody wants to look at me anyway dont worry. 
Hes insulted everything about me and controls me to the point i dread coming home.

He locks the fridge, he locks his bedroom, locks cabinets, doesnt let me use the house phone, wont let me do anything myself and questions me if im going out. 
He called me a whore last weekend for going around to my friends house at 9pm for drinks. Every conversation dominates around him...his past time in the hospital when he was a technician. He wont let me talk and if i do im told im stupid or to grow up. 


Im 23 and tbh im ashmamed i still live at home, my income isnt enough (im trying to find work), i depend on him for food and a roof over my head. 
Hes opened my letters, intervened in my medical treatment, threatened me, hit me over the head and mulitiple times he has told me i deserve to be hit, someone needs too.

My ex came into my house once and asked why i take it from an old man. He barged into my bedroom when me and my ex were sitting on my bed and gritted his teeth at me. Nobody can understand what its like living under this roof and arguing with him. 

He done the same thing to my brother, threatened him and controlled his life.
He stopped me joing the military at 16 and forced me into college because he didnt trust me to have a job.


Sometimes he can be so nice, he brought me a rabbit once, offers me lifts and says he just wants me to find a nice man and settle down (but each time i do he accuses them of being drug dealers or after sex) he accused my friend of being a prostitute because shes Lithuanian. 


I have been in touch with supported living but its miles away to move and i have no income..i honestly dont know how im gonna manage on my own. "
311,A short tidbit,Mistress_Jedana,0,14,63,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536057614.0,9cugkr,"So, JNMiL and I were sitting on the couch yesterday.   DH was napping, and she was watching one of those baking contest shows (one that had already run, and the channel was just running the whole series again).  I was sitting there, playing on my Kindle (Fairway Solitaire).   We're talking a little about this and that, and the baking show...and somehow, we got on the subject of mother in laws.    


She started talking about how her MIL would come over and wax her hardwood floors, and then the kids would put on socks, and slide around to buff it.  (Spoiler:  DH says that didn't happen, that MIL did her own waxing but they did sock buff it after.)   She was also going on about how her MIL would come cook for them and if she didn't like it, she'd still eat it to be polite.    


I say 'well, I haven't ever had a MIL that would come over and clean up or cook.  Besides, I don't need anyone to keep up on my house, I do just fine on my own...as long as I don't have to wait on people to get up so I don't have to worry about noise waking them up.'  (small dig at her, as she got her ass out of bed at 12:30 yesterday...yes, while we were eating lunch.  Waiting to come out until after we had already cooked and were eating.  I did get up to throw a hot dog on her, and I did warm her bun like I did DS's, but I did not make it for her.  I don't make them for my 14 year old son, I'm not making her food for her.)   \[side note:  Johnsonville makes these sweet and spicy sausages...OMG.  DH and I will eat the hell out of those.  Some garlic aoili mustard from Walmart, dill pickles and a good crusty roll...mmmmmmmmmmm\]    


Then she starts 'I would never disrespect my MIL. I always talked to her with respect and about her with respect.  I would never say anything bad about her to nobody.  I was raised to respect my elders.'  


I looked her right in the eye, and said 'well, my former MIL is a cunt who deserves nothing but my loathing...and in my world, you earn your respect.  Age has nothing to do with it.'   And I went back to my game.    


She said nothing else to me until DH got up from his nap thirty minutes later.

Then asks where I'm going, i say Walmart, she asks if I want to go with her, I say no because I also wanted to go to a bookstore afterwards. She gets pissed. Shows me the oil thing then tells me she'll go to a different Walmart so I don't have to be seen with her. That I insulted her. Asks what happened to me. Says, ""I'm done with you."" and storms off. 

I texted her an apology saying it wasn't personal I just wanted to be able to shop and look around because she doesn't like that. She responds by saying ""It is personal. You did want me going to the murder mystery with you. You did not want me going to see a movie with you. It is all well and good when you need for something, but heaven forbid I should simply want the pleasure of your company. Your actions speak volumes."" The murder mystery was an on campus event at college that when I told her I was going she asked to come and I said I didn't want that. I also spent $200 on going with her to a murder mystery party that wasn't on campus. The movies is I think in reference to going to see a movie for my birthday with David and Sarah. Keep in mind I have offered to go to the movies with her separately than that but she always declines. 

I'm 22 and just go my license. She's been driving me to and from work this summer and I always said thank you. 

I'm planning a murder mystery for her birthday. I don't know what's going to happen with that. 

I moved out of their house to get away from my awful father and I'm staying with a friend of hers. I pay rent to him, but I don't know if this will affect that. 

I have two friends that live locally. They're siblings and their mom likes me. They said I can stay with them if things get bad but I don't want to burden them. 

I can't afford a real apartment on my own at the moment. I'm trying to get a second job so I can but I'm not getting anything so far. 

Update: She just called me crying about how I've broken her heart and insulted her. Because I don't text her to ask how she's doing or call her up. She wants to know if me planning this party will be an imposition on her, I said no. I tried to reassure her I still want a relationship. She says I have to ""figure this out"" for myself on having a ""close"" (read: codependent) relationship with her. She knows moving back home would be hell for me, it's hell for her being there.

314,Glum Gabby and the Pasta Throwdown,Danceswithmorons,0,5,46,False,JUSTNOMIL,"O hai, Satan!",1536080528.0,9cxk5a,"*Recap: Glum Gabby is my fMIL. She is disabled and living on her own isn't really an option. She also meets all the requirements for 'independence' so big live in care / old folks home are out of reach at this time. SO and I are solid, he has a great spine. I live with SO and fMIL part-time so I don't rock the boat too much and have no immediate plans to move in full-time.*

So yesterday, let's talk about yesterday.

My day job is set hours at a computer - a virtual job.  I also freelance so I'm BFFs with my computer.  Glum Gabby has been told many times in the past by SO to leave me alone when I am working.  Now, I'm not heartless - some small tasks are totally fine.  But the unspoken rule is that (1) it has to be something she has tried to do and (2) if it can wait until I'm off the clock it waits.

Pretty simple stuff.

Even though the household now includes SO's niece (Glum's granddaughter) and niece's young daughter - many days when I'm here it is just Glum and I until they get off work.

So yesterday... It all started with a pair of shoes.  Neice's daughter's birthday is around the corner and she loves shoes that have sparkles.  Glum wants to get her a pair.

Glum comes in the bedroom, telling me the plan and asking if I can help her order the right size.  That's okay-ish.  Glum has ordered crap gifts off the internet before including this [ugly thing](https://www.google.com/search?q=monkey+shirt&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwixxd_726HdAhUQlKwKHb6ZARsQ_AUICygC&biw=1600&bih=794#imgrc=VXswtv03ctzrJM) and PJ's that are beyond too small.  So, confirming the right size should only take a quick glance at her phone.

Only, this is Glum Gabby.

She hands me her phone, and it's on an EBay search screen.  I know this is somewhat petty on my part, but it's obvious that she hasn't tried or picked out the shoes yet - and she is trying to get me to pick them out for her.  I tell her, ""You handed me a screen with lots of shoes, pick out the ones you want and I'll be happy to confirm the size.""  She gets pissy, clicks on a pair without paying attention and hands me the phone back.  

""Those are adult sizes only.  You have to find the ones you want first.""

A flood 'can't's came rolling out.  And when I basically repeated myself she shot back, ""You always have an attitude with me.""

""Well, you have interrupted me when I am working to do something for you when you haven't even picked out the shoes.  I will be happy to confirm the size for you - but you have to pick out the shoes.  And you coming in here is the same thing as coming into my office.  This is my work time.  I agreed to help, but I won't order them for you.""

Thinking she was being slick, ""I just won't come in here and bother you anymore then."" 

""Okay.  Thank you.""  Being polite with her is always a fun tool.  She hates that she can't run to SO and say I've called her a name.  She always has this look on her face like she accidentally walked into fresh dog poop barefooted when I 'thank' her instead of chasing her down and consoling her. 

And that was the end for a few hours.  But in JustNo fashion Glum Gabby was stewing.  I did shoot off a simple text to SO to let him know that ""I was a horrible person who told his mom 'no'.  I'm the meanest ever.""  Followed by a juvenile gif war so he would know he was coming home to potential drama.

I cooked a quick pasta dinner.  Enough for everyone.

Everyone was home, but SO was in a back room.  Niece was fixing a plate for her and her daughter and offered to fix Glum some.  At first, Glum wanted it - and then Niece said the unthinkable.  ""OP made it.""  

Glum changed her tune, she didn't want it.  Niece looked at me confused and I whisper that Glum was mad at me for something small.  Quickly said how Glum doesn't really like me in general and she loves picking silly stuff with me.  Niece didn't quite know what to do with this info - beyond being a bit surprised.  Niece drops it and sits at the table.

But war was brewing.  

SO came out from the back.  He also offered to fix Glum a plate.  She said 'no'.  I told him what he had missed with Niece.  

To color this - Glum never says no to food.  She has eaten my cooking and pasta more times than I can count.  If you bring her a plate of something she will always say yes or take it because it means she is waited on gets to be lazy.

SO went Hulk-mode.  It was sexy as hell. He must of asked ""Why aren't you eating"" 15 odd times.  

And I hear you... That gave her attention etc.  Glum only thrives on attention when she is the victim.  So instead of ""she was so sad, and hurt, and blah blah blah"" SO flipped it to ""What is YOUR problem Mom?""  To which she already lost.  She wasn't being allowed to sulk.  Niece wasn't coming to her rescue.  No one felt bad for her or was rushing to her side.  Instead, it was ""What is YOUR problem?""

The best part?  After Glum Gabby got her plate dinner rolled on.  SO, Niece and I had a conversation about vegetarian food (something Glum always tries to make me feel bad about) and Niece's other grandma who she is really really close to.

Suck it Glum Gabby.  

P.S.  I'm writing this because it helps me keep the incidents in order and I believe things are about to get more interesting.  I also think it is important to show how a SO can completely have your back and how that can zap a lot of the JustNo's 'power'.  

And if you are only commenting to tell us to look into other living arrangments.  That will happen with time - but right now it isn't possible. Glum has no savings and doesn't receive enough assistance to fund it.  It is in the pipelines but some other benchmarks have to be met first."
315,nDad verbal abuse or legitimate criticism? Self-doubt,noitatiplap,0,1,3,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536086204.0,9cyfk8,"I think I just want badly to believe I have a dad who has my best interests at heart. But all he has ever done is chip away at me, subtly undermining my goals and giving nothing in terms of support or encouragement.

\-he told me I should marry someone in my chosen profession instead of pursuing it myself

\-asked me if I really wanted to spend my life doing work so dull

\-asked me what I had that was so special that I could get into the program, when several of my peers are already in it

\-forgets important details about what I am doing currently, despite clearly having told him

This is after a history of full-on physical abuse, neglect and verbal abuse, constantly insisting that everything I do is wrong. He has also talked about me in a sexualized way before. I am not doing great in life, I think largely as a result of abuse and resulting mental health issues. 

Part of me realizes I probably need to go NC but my self-esteem sucks and I am very self-doubting. Also financially dependent. Posting here hoping someone will help me see the forest for the trees."
316,Anyone else feel societal pressures to keep a relationship with their Nparent (s)?,alien_crybaby,0,11,19,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536083034.0,9cxycj,"The title pretty much says it all. However I do have a few things to add. 

Specifically, I have two different information coming from two different reputable people and I don't know who's advice to take. 

A woman (40) I know tells me that I should keep the relationship with my mom even though it's still toxic. Her mother is very emotionally abusive and a diagnosed narcissist. She's basically told me to ""pick your battles"". 

Another girl (20) I know says it's perfectly fine to cut off your parents if they are still toxic to your mental health and that I shouldn't feel guilty if I do. She as well had a narcissistic mother. 

I guess I just need more opinions from other people with similar situations. So how do you guys feel about it? Is it alright to cut off toxic parents or should we keep them in our lives simply because they are our parents? "
317,I messed up bigtime.,raregoodmoods,0,12,13,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536150676.0,9d62ae,"I met my fiance 6 years ago and we have been dating on and off for years. We moved in together in 2015, and in all this time I had met his mother once. Well DF and his mom lived with his grandmother when he was growing up, and when we would hang out most of the time we would go to his grandmother's house, who was always kind to me.

His mother however was not. The first time I met her in person, she was weird with me. Like that feeling you get when somebody is judging you for your weight or face or whatever. Not an insecure person, but it was evident. She was super nice to me on the phone before I met her in person.

Well things kept coming up, like her snobbing my cooking and my mother. My mom has a cute little story about my brother being bad in the 80s so she dropped him off at the cemetery at like 5 pm, and came back to get him and he was fine and everything but it's just one of my mom's funny story. Well DF and I were discussing it and she said ""wow DF i guess you were lucky to have me as a mom because that's bad parentinf"" and then starts cackling. I do mean cackling.

It was one dig after another. She insulted my shoe size. And my height. She also asked me how old i was turning on my birthday ""are you turning 29 or 30?"" I was turning 23. DF is two years older than me, it was another dig.

Well one day after two years i snapped.  Couldn't take it anymore. I don't know maybe I was weak, but I told her and her husband off. I told her how she was being disrespectful, I told her she had no room to be critical over how I run my household when she never had her own, (Her and husband were living with his parents atm) and I called her out on ignoring DFs dental health in his childhood when she had blue cross blue shield and an excellent dental plan for 12 years and he went to the dentist and doctor 2 times each.

And of course she claimed she was never disrespectful. She called me a bully (haha great irony) and pretended to be the victim. So now I have to deal with this woman constantly because when we moved, she followed.

They have a fancy house now with a decent trailer an acre back and are offering to let us live there after she manipulated DF into getting a dodge charger he always wanted which now interferes with our bills.

DF is considering moving in with them. However I know I have two enemies for life. And you can't live under the same roof as your enemies and ever be safe.

I need advice, opinions. I know I was immature to confront her like that, I should have played the long game. But I'm just wondering how I can survive this.

319,Inviting the GC’s inlaws to SC wedding,sad_writer_for_now,0,1,1,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536135023.0,9d4cy0,"Hi all! In my quest to get out of the fog, I just realized what happened at my wedding one year ago.

My hubby and I organized a very small wedding, where we live, which is far away from both my family and his family. I knew that if I got married in my hometown, I’d have to endure a big fat 200-attendees wedding, which as an introvert is a fucking nightmare. Also, I hated the idea of having people over that don’t care about me, that I don’t care about, that I haven’t seen in 20 years, and that are probably just there to bitch about my dress or my hubby.

So we married far away. 50 people were invited, of course also my big fat family, but I employed every sneaky technique I knew to discourage them from coming (for instance, by sending the invites for my cousins to their parents... Subtle cultural stuff to make them feel unwelcome. Don’t judge me - I have 10 cousins and only get along with 5 of them).

My slightly-Nmum insisted to have my GCsis inlaws invited. Now, let me stress that *my sis is not married*. She has been in a long-term relationship with the guy (5 years) and I suddenly had to deal with these people ALL. THE. FUCKING. TIME. Christmas, Easter, summer holidays... You name it. Whenever my parents would come over to where me and my sis live, they would come over too, and I’d have to deal with these people.

So, when the time came, hubby and I were more than adamant that we did not want them to the wedding. Nope. They are 4 and for people who we’ve already had to meet more than we wanted, it was like throwing money out of the window.

But my mum insisted a lot, said “how shameful would be if you don’t”, that “she couldn’t have looked them in the eyes anymore” and so on. 

I caved. We caved. To this day, they were the only older people there besides my parents, my hubby’s parents, and two aunts.

Also, when I invited them, they said that they didn’t expect it and that they would have totally understood and it would have been totally fine if we hadn’t invited them.

So my question is: is that narc behavior to you?

I am coming out of the fog more and more myself and I am involving my hubby as we are planning to have a baby next year. Any resources or books you may recommend (I have only read *Will I ever be good enough?* so far) are greatly appreciated.

Edit: grammar"
320,WAE not allowed to perform self-care/hygienic tasks because nParent(s) put themselves in charge of your autonomy?,Red_White_And_FUCK_U,0,48,220,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536048803.0,9ctnzp,"I know this a really weird and specific question. To share my example, when I was 11 in 7th grade, during the throes of puberty, I developed really bad cystic acne. I can't recall how this regimen began exactly, but it got to a point where my nMom would lock the two of us in the bathroom at the end of the night (around 9/10 pm), soak a washcloth in scorching hot water, use it to scrape my face like she was trying to scratch old paint off of wood, then would push me up against a wall with her body weight, and use her thumbs/nails to start popping all of my pimples.  

&nbsp; 

The entire ordeal would last 1-2 hours. If I ever spontaneously yelped-out ""OW!"" or twitched my face/body from the pain, she would start slapping my arms and face because I ""hurt her ears from shouting"" or ""messed her up"". Her rationale was that if my acne went unchecked, I would develop pock marks when I was older, so marring my face for 2 hours every night was necessary to protect from any scaring. Naturally, I was too young and stupid to do this on my own, so my nMom would force this on me every night, never showing my how or why I should take care of my face, only that she knew best.  

&nbsp; 

I would go always go to school the next day, having my face decorated with bruises and scabs from all the picking. It got to a point where I found a bathroom at school that no one ever went into at lunch that had a mirror, and started to poke my face. I thought if I could do it myself, I could be more gentle, it would hurt less, and I could go to sleep earlier. When our cleansing ritual rolled around, nMom was infuriated that I ""*destroyed my face behind her back*"" while whipping me with a slipper. After that, when I woke up in the morning, she would take stock of all the fresh new blemishes and document them. It was indicated that if I returned home with scabs where the new pimples had formed, I would be severely punished.  

&nbsp; 

In science class, they would show us an episodes of Bill Nye and there was one where they discussed skin care and warned that breaking the skin could spread bacteria, increasing the possibility of breaking out. I remember feeling this overwhelming sense of relief thinking I would tell my nParents this and I wouldn't have to deal with my nightly abuse anymore. Nope, I ""*was lying*"", and if it actually did happen, a ""*kids shows don't know what it's talking about*"" so the abuse continued. It wasn't until I was a Freshman in High School that my skin got so bad I had to go to a Dermatologist who prescribed me Accutane, while having a sit in with me and my nMom, I asked the Doctor about poking pimples, and he was adamant that was probably one of the worst ways to achieve clear skin and I remember nMom getting visibly agitated/uncomfortable.  

&nbsp;

On the ride home I couldn't help rubbing it in her face, after having to suffer every night for 3 years and she started telling me how I was an ungrateful little ""*shet*"" (*nMom is from South America*) and how God would punish me for not honoring her. When I've brought this instance up as an adult, nMom gasps dramatically while faking crying, saying ""*Ayyyyeeeeeeeee! Senor Jesucristo! I never deed dat! You es lying!*""  

&nbsp;  

Sorry for my Magna Carta of an explanation, but I'm curious if anyone else suffered through similar self-serving abuse / sabotauge disguised as ""help""?"

322,I'm wasting my life on these people,pixie_led,0,5,10,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536096376.0,9czwaj,"I just got blown up at because I told my Nsister's child that a colleague of mine offered to help her to find work at an organisation. The response I got from my Nsister and Nmom was that I should have known she had applied there already, after which my Nmom proceeded to essentially suggest that I really didn't want to help my niece find work! When I got angry at the unfairness of the response I was receiving she then proceeded to
declare that I never loved her, that I think I'm better than everyone else because I have a career (Nmom has always been a housewife and my Nsis just never worked after her child was born), that ""if I really wanted to help"" -and then she stops short and laughs sarcastically, so I have no idea what else she expects me to do? 

So essentially I helped word, get signed and certified a recommendation for my Nsis's child, plus an offer of assistance to get employed - and that makes me the Devil! 

Two weeks ago I travelled with her to another city and took her around to an organisation where she was applying for work - but I'm the Devil!

And when, upset and emotional, I complain that Nsis daughter herself could at least speak up to defend me, seeing that I'm actually trying to help her - she haughtily responds ""I don't get involved in your issues"" and walks off.

And when, emotional and upset, I accuse my Nsis of treating me badly and being fucking ungrateful after all the years I have loved her child like my own - she spat at me twice.

What the fuck am I doing dealing with these people? What the fuck is my life about? Why does everything I sacrificed to build over the years mean nothing? Why am I falling apart?"
323,How do I survive 46 more days with my Nmom?,katelynnlemons,0,3,3,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536094188.0,9czl54,"I could probably write an entire book about how narcissistic my mother is. In fact I don't consider her a mother. I have provided for myself since I was 15 and I am now 17. I have provided for everything that I need. School supplies, toiletries, clothes, even food.

My mom physically abused me but has stopped a while ago. She emotionally abuses me daily. She insults my appearance and puts me down. She insists that me being in college is a waste of time because I will not succeed. It's my second week of college and I can not succeed by living in this house. I can't even do my homework because my enviroment is so chaotic.

Despite all the shit she put me through, she still believes she is a great mother. My father is out of the picture but he was an abusive druggie. When I started college my mother grounded me from doing anything until I turn 18. She grounded me because she doesn't want me out doing ""college kid things"". This may sound like I am bragging or something but I swear to you I am very innocent. I never go to parties or anything so this doesn't make any sense.

I am forced to stay in my room all the time. When I go to college, I go to my classes and straight back home and into my room. I'm not allowed to step out of my room. My birthday is in 46 days and I cannot handle being locked up anymore. I have become very lonely and depressed. I cry a lot mostly because I'm very frustrated and lonely.

I’m currently pregnant with SO’s son. We are not married, however we are now living together. Boyfriend and I were together for over year, however boyfriends mom made no effort to get to know me until after the pregnancy was announced. At first it was great, and then once he moved out she totally changed. She has been not so nice to me this entire pregnancy. I have had feelings she did not like me at all, but bf continues to deny it and says it’s just me being sensitive until recently when we argued. After this I had enough, I texted her saying if she had an issue with me that I would like a conversation about it. Instead of texting me, she texts SO about it. Saying “I think a conversation needs to be done over face” exactly what I had said. Now I get the feeling she was only trying to stir the pot because she texting him saying “I didn’t mean to cause problems between y’all, I figured you knew about her texting me, however I think we need to have a face to face discussion”. It didn’t cause problems, and she never brought it up to me, or at all. Fast forward a month of me staying out of her way, she texts SO asking if he would like a baby shower. He responded that I would like one so she begins planning one and inviting all of her friends and family “to celebrate the upcoming birth of her first grandson”. However, I recently found out she has invited SO’s ex girlfriend to the baby shower. She was the only non-friend and non-family member she invited. His ex is not friends with him, and through the guest list there wasn’t a single friend of his invited. I brought this up so SO and his response was that she’s friends with his exes mom.

325,Previously transphobic MIL is suddenly supportive of Fiance (FtM) shortly after discovering he's pregnant. I have strong doubts.,gayapiary,0,70,82,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536101766.0,9d0ltu,"First time posting, made an account for this subreddit. 

My fiance and I are a gay couple, currently staying with MIL due to a perfect storm of inconveniences. It isn't permanent, but we've still got a way to go before moving out. Originally I had booked a hotel to stay at, but after a week, MIL asked Fiance to come stay in his old room. I still spend a large amount of time at the hotel, because I'm still working out of my laptop and working at MIL's house isn't feasible (she acts like the world's most nosy and unwanted secretary, coming in every 15-20 minutes with a brew/wanting to snoop) and all I really need to work is a room with a table, wifi and lockable door.

I don't get along with MIL. She usually flip-flops from tolerable to annoying. Two big points of contention that I'll mention here is that she constantly encourages/demands I call her 'Mum' and let her treat me like the 'son she never had' (MIL has three daughters and desperately wanted boys, according to Fiance), and her transphobic attitude towards Fiance since he came out in his teenage years (constantly deadnaming, misgendering him and making comments framing us as a straight couple). Fiance originally came out to MIL first, as her bemoaning the lack of a son led him to believe she'd be the most supportive. She wasn't. They've had a rocky relationship ever since, going between regular and low contact, largely due to Fiance's very beloved younger, teenage sibling who still lives with MIL. He really wants a normal relationship with MIL, especially as we've started talking more seriously about wedding planning. 

Fiance discovered he was pregnant in MIL's bathroom, and she discovered it more or less immediately after finding the used tests in the trash. He'd been feeling 'off' for a few days and is generally very aware of/sensitive to changes in his body. I wish I could have been there in person  when he found out, but it was during the day, and I was at the hotel, working. We use condoms as Fiance isn't comfortable with hormone-based contraception. We both want children, but any conversations in the past have been about adoption or possibly becoming foster parents, never about conceiving naturally. Fiance has always been slightly paranoid about becoming pregnant, and has never given me the impression it's something he wants to experience for obvious reasons of dysphoria. 

My issue isn't whether or not Fiance decides to keep the child. Financially, we can afford it, and I'll support whatever choice he makes. It's MIL's reaction: she's bloody DELIGHTED. It's like a switch has flipped and she's doting on Fiance constantly, waxing poetically about how younger sibling will be a cute aunt, she'll be a grandmommy, and he'll make a great dad. Yes. A great DAD. She's FINALLY begun respecting his pronouns and gender, and it's making him so fucking happy to see her so supportive and engaged. I'd be right there with him if it wasn't because the switch flipped after he became pregnant. I'm paranoid. I'm skeptical. I can't make myself trust that she's doing this because she's finally come around or because she really, really wants a grandson and Fiance is still in two minds about going through with the pregnancy. She's in his ear a lot as he's staying at her place during the day while I work, and I think it's influencing him more than he wants to admit. 

I want to be supportive. I want to see them have a good relationship. It kills me knowing that Fiance just wants his mum to be proud of her boy. I don't want him to have to bear a child and potentially go through mind-wrecking dysphoria for it to happen. I want him to make the choice for himself, for us. I want our child(ren) to be wanted because we want them, not the bridge that gaps their relationships. I feel terribly guilty and selfish for feeling this way, which is why I haven't spoken to Fiance about this yet.

Clearly, I need to talk to my Fiance one-on-one. This I plan on doing sooner rather than later. Advice on how to approach him with my doubts is welcome. I also worry this is purely me overreacting. That I'm vilifying a mother who is beginning tor realise that she DOES care about her family. If that's the case, please let me have it. 

I guess I'm looking for advice or a bit of perspective.

328,I can't believe nmom sold it...,lucid_shad0w,0,58,155,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536072943.0,9cwcjs,"...Wait, yes I can, but I'm still mad.

When I was a kid, I was super into collecting Breyer horses (realistic model horses).  Knowing this, my grandfather offer to build me a custom barn to house them in.  He did an amazing job and presented it to me at Christmas.  It was awesome and got a ton of use.

Fast forward: As I'm moving out at 22, I took my Breyer horses with me but left the barn as it was large and my apartment was small.  Nmom at the time was storing all of my old toys in hopes that a grandchild would be able to play with them.  Nparents had a basement and even when I bought my first house it was in North Carolina and had no basement.  Believing that nmom was keeping all of my old toys, I didn't think much of it.

Fast forward some more: We move back up to Ohio so my daughter can be closer to all of her family.  Nmom start slowly giving out my old toys to her (of course, it's a little bit at a time as an ""excuse"" to see my daughter).  Last night, nmom gives my daughter all of the Breyer horse accessories then casually mentions that she had gotten rid of the barn because it was too big.  I sat that flabbergasted because that literally was the only thing I cared about, and she didn't keep it (i.e. she sold it, and pocketed the money).

I'm still upset today.  I know it's just a thing, but it was the nicest thing my grandfather every gave me (he died in early 2013) and I was looking forward to seeing my daughter play with it.  If she would have said something that she didn't want to store it anymore, I would have gladly taken it off of her hands.  Rather, I'm assuming that she just wanted the money.  If I would have known this was going to happen, It would have been the first thing I'd have taken with me when I first moved out.  The hubby convinced me to email her about it, since it's apparently upsetting me this much.  We'll see how that goes...

Edit: Thanks guys for the responses and thanks for letting me vent for a bit (which was what I needed).  Like I said, it is just a thing, and I still have the memories of playing with it.  I overall feel better and am letting this one go.  I wish I would have taken it with me when I first moved out, but I had no idea what narcissists were at the time and the big blow-ups hadn't started yet either (those came later when I started having opinions of my own and I stopped kissing their butts so much).  By the time I knew what they were, I'm sure it was gone.  That being said, it's time to move on.  I can remember my grandpa in other ways.  Like some of you have suggested, I'm going to see about making a new one, possibly with my FIL helping (who is the nicest most wonderful person). That will give it special meaning for my daughter.  As for nmom in the mean-time, she's mad that I (finally) voiced my emotions, so maybe I'll get a break from her for a bit.  


Also, whole issue came right after this ([https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/9c5f24/nparents\_apparently\_trespassed\_into\_my\_house\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/9c5f24/nparents_apparently_trespassed_into_my_house_this/)) happened, so I'm still reeling from that. I spent a good deal of my adult life 500 miles away from them.  Now, that they are closer, I'm just going to have to do a better job at keeping up my guard."
329,Parents’ anniversary,goldenparachutes,0,1,2,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536105780.0,9d13wq,"My mother is a very self-centered, rude, manipulative, lazy woman who for the last several years has barely acknowledged many of my birthdays or achievements. Today is my parents anniversary and it is a rather loveless marriage, but my mom is the type of person who gets mad when her children don’t acknowledge the date. I have an older brother and sister. Yesterday my immediate family got together for a simple cookout dinner to for a low key celebration and in the next few days, we’re all going out to eat for a more formal celebration. 

Earlier today, my dad messages me to remind me to wish mom a happy anniversary so I did through text because I’ve been nonstop all day with school and the dialogue went like this:

Me- Happy anniversary 

Mom- Thank you! Do you know how many years

Me- 25 (*i had to think about that for a second*)

Mom- Did you also know that kids are supposed to have a surprise anniversary party for their parents?

I couldn’t even respond to that, I was just so floored. I was not aware that was a thing, and I know it’s all an excuse to make me feel guilty, but at the same time I’m thinking a whirlwind of things. Does she not realize her son just bought a house and is trying to juggle working full time and trying to do necessary repairs to the house while also raising a 3-month-old baby? Does she not realize her older daughter has been home for a month to work on her mental health? Does she not realize I’ve been working my ass off every day so I can have enough money to put myself through grad school that just started today? My mom has expressed to a few people over the last few weeks that her children are disappointments to her. That goes up my ass, but I’m done venting for now. Thanks for hanging around to read this."

331,T-Rex in the now (current situation),commentspanda,0,20,64,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536120587.0,9d2wjf,"At the moment, I am totally NC with T-Rex. I don’t reply to any texts or calls, I don’t listen to voicemails, I don’t actively open anything in the mail from her and if she does send me something it goes in the bin. I sometimes check in with DF on if she’s contacted, or to remind him of any upcoming significant events she will be triggered by, but I don’t respond to anything directed at me. I have been clear with DF I have needed significant time to consider my ongoing relationship with her. 

As Christmas approaches for 2018 we will be visiting hometown. Our last contact was at beautiful Nanna’s gathering about 9 months ago where I had minimal interaction with her and the younger members of his family worked hard to run interference and avoid any uncomfortable interactions for either of us. He has had sporadic contact with her since then (some texts, a lot of grey rock on requests for info) and has decided he will go to see her for an agreed time period of time on Christmas Eve this year as per the previous arrangement that was in place. He feels strongly that if I refuse to go and maintain NC, it is rewarding her behaviour by giving her what she wants - him on his own. There is also the added complexity of her brain injury and the lack of control it causes and there is absolutely no doubt she is getting worse. After much internal emotional wrestling, I’ve made the decision that I will go with him but have made it clear I’ll be politely grey rocking on anything personal the whole time and if she makes me uncomfortable, there will be one redirection, then one clear warning and that’s it. I have no shame in using my trauma teaching techniques on her crazy ass. The plan is: 

T-Rex “blah blah blah topic commentspanda doesn’t like such as babies, her salary, her weight, the wedding blah blah”

OP: politely attempts to change subject 

T-Rex: returns to subject 

OP: “I have attempted to politely end this topic of conversation once already T-Rex. I’m not comfortable discussing this topic and would like you to change the subject. I am being direct with you as you may not have noticed when I tried to subtly change the subject earlier. Please change it now”

If she won’t, I’ll simply be leaving. He can come if he wants to. DF expressed he felt this still rewarded the behaviour and that she would just do it every time to get rid of me. I have made it clear that if it comes to this point and he doesn’t leave with me, that will be full NC from me permanently. No take backs. I’ve tried to explain it’s not a judgment on him - if he truly feels I’m overreacting by leaving then he needs to make his own decision and I won’t be upset with him if that decision is to stay - but that will be the end for me. I’ve reached as far as I can go in terms of civil contact. She’s his mother and he loves her and she’s unwell - I get it, and I fully support any decision he makes and he can manage her with his own strategies from that point onwards. DF has come around to this approach as he feels if we get to the point where I do give the verbal back-the-fuck-off warning, one of two things will happen:

- She will freak out that things are going badly and rapidly back track to save face and make sure her baaaaaby doesn’t leave early
- She will lose her shit at the statement and he will leave with me at that point anyway because crazy a T-Rex is not a rational T-Rex

Personally, I am far more confident in my ability to handle her these days. For the last year I’ve worked in a high stress environment and am regularly dealing with escalated or traumatised young individuals....she has nothing on them. She’s no threat to me and she can’t cause any emotional damage with words if I don’t let her. 

I do still worry about her sometimes, but only because I worry about DF and the impact all this has on him. I find myself playing out possible interactions in my head (not healthy, I know) and my anxiety response goes through the roof when we talk about her....but I can clearly identify that’s in relation to the outcome for him, or for us, rather than specifically about my interactions. 

So, that’s the adventures of T-Rex to date. Writing it out has been really beneficial, it’s helped me see both the clear degeneration in her behaviour and how that had impacted on their relationship....but it’s also clear how hard I worked over the last 10 years to try and keep it civil. Thank you all for reading the background adventures of T-Rex! I assume I’ll be updating again soon as Christmas edges closer and closer. "
332,Update to: 13 days out and over it.,modernjaneausten,0,63,183,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536031496.0,9crzzj,"So I dropped the rope for the catering choices and told FH to deal with it, and my mom and I have a game plan together for food for myself and my bridesmaids. But trying to talk to FH about how his mom and brother have made me feel during the planning process was a disaster. It's starting to feel like the 3 of them against the world, and like somehow I'm creating issues where there are none. How do I approach this without either one of us getting defensive? We can never agree on the fact that his mom is kind of controlling. His dad has straight up said to my dad that she always controlled the boys. How does he not see it? I'm tired of getting the ""mommy knows best"" routine just because she and the other people he grew up with all have this formula for weddings and bridal/baby showers. I told him I was willing to drop things if it was just about cost, but she wanted us to change the veggies and fruits to something else entirely. 

Updated to add: FH and I had a long talk about a lot of the things contributing to this blowup, and he gets why I'm stressed but I think he's frustrated feeling like I'm always ready for a fight with her. You guys won't like this but he was kinda right about that. But I did thoroughly explain how it feels like me vs them and that I get frustrated with being told she knows more. She does but I also had done a ton of research and brainstorming and consulting with others for what I wanted, and I pointed out the only details that have changed have involved his mom or brother. We both agreed we need to be team us and I told him I will happily askfor her or my mom's guidance in life if we have kids but I'm not having any until we have been married awhile and can get him out of the fog. I will be taking the suggestions for counseling for us because I love him dearly and I think he's worth it. And since I only post about negative situations with his mom, I haven't been able to give background on all the times he does stand up for us. I'm also taking someone's suggestion to get his dad involved. I'm hopeful he can help. "
333,Should I go NC with Golden Child?,lilywillheal,0,7,2,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536100396.0,9d0fmk,"My therapists have suggested I go NC with nmom, but I didn't dare to when I was a teenager. Now, I am slowly planning to go from LC to NC.

My question is, should I go NC with my sibling too? He always takes nmoms side (he is financially dependent on her etc.) and gets really angry if anyone criticizes her, so  I have not done that for years in front of him. Is this enough, or should I cut him out?   


I would miss him. I don't really have a lot of family left. But I will pay that price if I need to in order to be free."

Yes, I still struggle to try to bound with her. But I have a good year under my belt of not using SO to talk to her or enable her.

Two weeks! Bitch bot has our rambling story, but pretty much SO and I don't value traditional weddings. We've both been in enough wedding parties to see how *more* fun (for us) it is to stand with bride/groom versus being bride/groom. We want to get married for tax and insurance reasons. After sharing our ""engagement"" with family, we've discussed all avenues of ceremony. We went from small destination wedding, to vegas, to courthouse. All our attempts were to give family *some* celebration because we DGAF. At each step we were met with criticism and offers of upgrading.

So they win. Wedding is planned for next year. MIL gets her ceremony with flowers and vows, and my dad gets to invite everyone I've met briefly since I was born. They win. Plan your wedding yall.

Cause that's all it is at this point. *Their* wedding. And you know what? SO and I are super excited for it! We're getting married in a civil ceremony two weeks from now, at our county court house. It's a secret, no one knows! Out closest couple friends will stand with us then we're hitting the county fair after. I AM SO EXCITED TO GET MARRIED THIS WAY.

The brewery we originally wanted to attend after elopement will now be the reception venue for wedding next year. It's like a costume party where I get to be bride.

Knowing we're getting married in two weeks **our way** has made next years wedding feel stress free, and *fun.* 

We could not have got here without this sub, thank you!"
335,Gollum has a foot in mouth moment. Acts like it wasn’t horrific.,Goodlittlewitch,0,6,167,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536010064.0,9cpel0,"This isn’t actually about me, but my family friend thinks these are hilarious (and sadly, accurate) and has allowed me to post it. 

And so hobbitses, here is the tale of Granny Gollum and the major, ridiculously hard to watch, kind of painful to hear about foot in mouth blunder in which Granny pretended after was a non-issue. 

“Granny Gollum has no issues being friendly” says GG, basically. Outwardly, she’s the friendliest person you’ll ever meet. When you first meet her, she comes off as this insanely generous, kind, thoughtful person and not at all the kind of person who will smile as she’s slamming your fingers in the door, but you’re all here so obviously you know better. 

Weddings... weddings make GG nuts. She prides herself on having had 4 bachelorette parties (work, friends, family, friends from other city) and having had her entire town chip in for her ridiculously lavish, 750 person wedding. She wants us all to have this luxury and the non stop attention and all the dramatic bullshit that never seems to end with large weddings and older ladies.  She tried multiple times to undermine my wedding and the only reason she backed off was because DH told her where to put her opinions. 

Anyhow, a little backstory here without rambling much more. My friend was raised by both of her parents in a wonderful loving family next door (relatively because mcmansion acreage thing) to GG& co. Growing up, the families were very good “don’t even knock just come in with a beer” type families, and the parents are still very close (and we all ended up very good friends obviously) 

The couple had decided to go mostly
DIY, have a 100 person wedding (kids included so really probably 75-80 people). They have very low key invitations, very understated  plans for decor, very beautiful but not in an obvious way kind of setup. Obviously GG has poo poo’d all of this because it’s small and the bride doesn’t like attention, which honestly baffles GG in general. 

So the other day, the bride came over to GG’s to show us the wonderful gift her mother had given her. In knowing that they wanted frugality and understated beauty, her mother had hand crafted the most beautiful bouquet you’ve ever seen- and promised to do more come next year closer to the date. 

We all gasped and were amazed by her mom’s clear eye for colour and style. It was gorgeous, feminine, and fit her thing perfectly. Gg? Said nothing. Then, when we thought we might be spared... 

“Well, that is NOT acceptable” 

... no one said a word. Thankfully DH took that moment to remind his mother that she is not involved, has no say, and is being a total ass for no reason. She excused herself for 10 and came back as we were all chatting over coffee. Bride had the sense to ask GG to lie to her mother about how she truly felt about the bouquet. 

GG replied “oh my gosh that is so beautiful I can’t wait to talk to your mother about that! She is just so creative you guys are going to have such a beautiful wedding!!! It reminds me of my wedding...(cue long, unrelated story that gives her the main stage and probably didn’t happen) 

We all excused ourselves after that one. Time to go home, circus is ramping up, long drive ahead of us. Bride has now told her family that GG gets no more info about pending nuptials haha

Sorry hobbitses, that was longer than I meant it to be. 

Tl;Dr Granny is a jerk who loves to rewrite history and when this story comes up later she’ll act like only the second part happened. "
336,"Princess Tantrum and the Thanks she was expecting, but did not receive",quietaccount34,1,42,381,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536111571.0,9d1tiw,"I have to be vague about some of this because it would be pretty identifying. I think the example I remember reading a while back was using weasels, so here we go.  


DH is a very good weasel rancher. And his current community of fellow weasel ranchers wanted to give him an honor at a semi-annual weasel rancher dinner, for a weasel stampede a few months back where he showed himself to be an especially adept weasel rancher. 

He was excited, and deservedly so, so he shared on social media about the award. Immediately, Princess Tantrum starts texting him about it, because SHE HAS TO GO. He didn't want to tell her, but couldn't think of an excuse (we're both still working on not JADEing) so he relented and told her she could come. She already claimed credit on the social media post, ""you are a good man who was raised by a good mother..."" ,-direct quote. Points to DH though, because he told PT that we would not all be driving together after she tried to talk him into coming and picking her up.

Last night was the dinner. There were about 80-100 people there, which would have me freaked out, but DH is great at wrangling weasels and working a room. Plus he knew almost everyone there. Princess Tantrum tried to drag him around to meet everyone, but instead he shook her off and went to get us drinks. She took herself around the room explaining who she was. It was really cringey, but at least she was away from the table for most of it. She did plenty of other BEC things, but this was where it got good:

When they announced his name, they played a snippet from a song from DH's favorite band. So that derailed his thank you speech because he started telling this story about how Princess Tantrum got angry that he liked this band, because his Uncle liked the same band and according to PT, ""uncle was bad news.""

The crowd laughs, and she titters next to me, but I can see she is starting to get embarassed/pissed. 

Next DH talks about how his parents took him to a weasel rodeo when he was a kid because they couldn't find a babysitter, and that was when he thought maybe he would like to make a  career out of weasel ranching. More tittering, more bulgy eyes. He did not thank her or his dad. 

Instead, he jumps into how I supported him going into Weasel ranching when he got out of the military, and all through school and was so grateful for the sacrifices the kids and I had made. It was super touching, I honestly didn't expect it, so I was a little misty eyed and a bit flushed.

 Princess Tantrum politely clapped, but turned back around in her seat so she was no longer facing the stage. Her expression was a cross between one of the heads from Easter Island and that vortex to hell that Buffy shoved Angel into. I knew she was really pissed when she didn't try to hug DH before me when he got back to the table. I was telling him good job and some not family-friendly suggestions for later, and she used the break to high tail it out of there without saying goodbye. DH made a comment wondering how long before she blasted him for not properly thanking her.

As of today, she deleted all of her posts about his event/award except for the one where she takes credit. And she made 3 posts blaming him for why her day is going so poorly, including complaining that he won't come over and organize her computer cords for her. Entitled, much?

The crown jewel was when SIL put up a post asking about people's experiences in a certain magical land, because ""next year, her WHOLE\[sic\] family is going..."" and she is looking for suggestions for somewhere everyone can stay together. Now, we had talked about this trip earlier this year. Preliminary planning took place, but had died off once summer started because of how hectic everyone's schedules were.

HOWEVER, SIL tagged herself, BIL, PT, mostly yes AIL, and UIL (yes, the same one that SIL has accused of being a child molester, go figure) in the post, implying that's the whole family. This was highlighted by AIL sending me a message asking if we could take care of their animals, since SIL told her that DH and I were not going. I don't care, because I would rather not go anywhere with them, let alone across the country. DH was irritated, but overall is doing a lot better about not taking the bait from either of these bitches. Meanwhile, I have gone around and taken the appropriate screenshots. I had a boss once tell me, ""always give people enough rope to hang themselves with,"" and it is a lesson that serves me well with these nutjobs. 

Oh, and bonus, FIL and SMIL babysat Baby for us while we were at the event. MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!"
337,My Nparents resent me for being a successful and functioning adult,LittleSeries,0,43,334,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536080557.0,9cxkc2,"My family was very poor growing up. My Nfather is 55 and is a high school drop out. My Nmother is 59 and dropped out of college and hasn't had a job since the late 70's. Throughout my life they pushed me to go to college and get a degree because they said it was the key to success, but they really had no idea what any of it meant. Their highest aspirations for me were for me to go to community college maybe.

So basically I had 0 guidance in life on where to go. My parents were no help, they have no idea how the world works and make no effort to learn. I went through school and got a degree in CS. My first job was working help desk for $6 dollars an hour (I'm 34 so this was in the mid 2000's). I made less with a college a degree than without one stacking boxes at a grocery store.

But I fought and was driven to climb the corporate ladder. I self taught myself countless things, gained experienced, and then moved from job to job to gain more money. It took me 7 companies and well over a decade, but I finally became successful. I worked my ass off and now I make 6 figures working in my living room in a city I used to vacation in. I'm happily married to my wonderful wife and we have a great life 5 states away from the city I grew up in.

My parents should be proud of me right? Wrong. They call my wife and I ""snobs"". They guilt trip me for moving away all the time (they want me to live in their shit hole neighborhood with them). They give us backhanded remarks in a condescending tone like ""you're so fancy"" and ""you're riccchhhhh"". They don't even know what I do for a living or what my company's name is called. When they visit me they tell me ""I live in a bubble"" and other bizarre shit. I even caught my Nmother talking shit about me to my aunt because she accidentally dialed my number and left the disturbing shit on my voicemail.

Worst of all is that talk about my brother's job and how great he is constantly. He's 30 and lives at home and he's a janitor. They go on and on about how good his job is and how successful he is. They do this because they can control him because and thus he's the ""golden child"". Never mind the fact that he put a gun to my father's face and said he was going to kill him. They didn't press charges of course. After all this he is held in a higher regard than myself while they resent me for not being in their stable to mental illness.

They can resent me all they want, the best revenge is a life well lived."
338,FMIL and the car - an uneventful update.,NoddyBowWow,0,13,75,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536053159.0,9cu19c,"So FDH and I timed it perfectly to where they would not be home when we went to pick it up. So that being said, let's get down to this bitch and her JustNo status.

My first encounter with her was when me and FDH were first dating, and I was being insecure about something and walked outside to have a cigarette. FMIL comes out, unbeknownst to FDH and tells me ""He is NOT cheating on you. My boy does not do that!"" (Arguement wasnt even about that, and I'm also FDH's first relationship. So, um, what?) I just said ""Okay."" and took another drag of my cigarette. Nothing too justno, but a little weird.

Enter FBIL and his (at the time) soon to be wife. I probably owe them my life, because while FBIL is MIL's minion, I got to witness from the start what type of person she was. 

FBIL's wife is a fucking bitch. She is only with FBIL because she is from Cambodia and wants her citizenship. She cheated on FBIL and their child isn't even his. She has told FBIL that she is leaving the moment their child doesn't need to be breastfed. She takes all his money and demands he works three jobs. The bitch needs to be deported.

.......according to FMIL. 

These two are literally the cutest, his wife is the sweetest, and it is obvious just by looking at them how much they love eachother.

I'll admit, I was on the ""just wants her green card"" train for a bit; until I met her and them together. So, I had the heads up that FMIL does NOT like her sons to be taken from her.

She pretty much adored me, up until the moment FDH said we were moving in together. I wasn't privy to it at the time, but she was slowly taking jabs to manipulate FDH to come home. 

-side note- I have never met somebody so preoccupied with other people's finances. She would bring my family up, almost innocently, and then segue into their/our financial situation. For example: my dad has had both knees replaced, multiple back surgeries, and is pretty immobile. So my parents have been looking at new houses. Houses that are not 6 bedroom, 4 bath, and three stories like their current home. FMIL: ""Ha. Yeah, that's what happens when you think you have more money than you do. Guess it's better than foreclosure"" This was relayed to be from FDH, otherwise I would have pointed out the fact that they are currently living in a trailer that they purchased for $2,000 and is being held together by duct tape, while my parents are about to close on a $600k home in a gated community that just so happens to be one-story so my dad can easily move around the house. - but I digress.

So, this all came to a head recently and I probably went nuclear way too quickly.
The financing company was willing to settle with us for a lesser amount, but FDH isnt the greatest at remembering dates. So he couldn't remember the date the payment was due. Well, I taught him a year or so ago to always record his phone calls. The call to the bank was made at work- no recording. But he did call his mom right after to tell her. So he said to just figure out what he told her.

Well, I guess FDH has a terrible memory in general, because he apparently didn't remember his mother saying that I was the reason for their financial troubles, and if he would have listened to her then they wouldn't be in this situation.

Say what? So, I go into my crazy girlfriend mode and listen to more calls. Every single one included some sort of jab at me, my family, or decisions I've made. And I can't even explain how covert they were, it was obviously her trying to subtly turn him.away from me.

The moment I heard that, coupled with the knowledge about FBIL and wife, I told FDH he had a choice. Either put that bitch in her place or leave. He apparently made his own option and just went NC until the car thing yesterday.

The entire time of NC, he was starting to open up about her treatment of him. He was having trouble with wondering if maybe it wasn't true. I just provided him with as many resources I could and cuddles and love. He is livid now, I'm going to beg my therapist to have his colleague make his appointment sooner.

Oh, and because this just blows my mind the most: we don't know where his dad stands about any of this. Because he is deaf. And FMIL refused to allow FDH to learn ASL. 

Chew on that one."
339,Forced contact with MadameMorrible literally making me sick.,FionnagainFeistyPaws,0,7,36,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536126207.0,9d3hdy,"To be bring the llamas up speed, *someones* tax department caught onto the fact that MadameMorrible has been playing hide and go seek, found her, and wants garnishments. 

There was supposed to be a standard hearing I was to attend simply to protest so fees per my lawyers advice. SO took time off to drive me across state (since I’m currently medically verboten from driving). 3 days before, we are notified this bitch has decided to put in a request, per that creepy scammer from another state, who is her “financial advisor,” to request the court appoint someone new to represent the third party (that isn’t her or me). 

The person currently representing the third party was designated in an uncontested will 20 years ago, has worked with me on reigning her ass in, and actually knew the person whose will set everything up. 
Clearly, my lawyer is not having this shit, and the court date got move to the week after the 1 year anniversary of my father’s death from cancer, which is fast approaching. 

It’s been almost a whole fucking year and she hasn’t provided any sort of list or documentation for her monthly bills/expenses for standard of living. Are you fucking kidding me?! 

I doubt she will attend this whole day out of state (for me) hearing, but MadameMorrible is absolutely desperate to speak to me. I’ve been NC for 9 months. I suspect she’ll be there if she at all can be. I scheduled an appointment with my therapist for tomorrow to come up with a plan to cover between now and the court date so that I’m prepared, explaining if she tries to come up and talk to me, I am going to feel threatened/act accordingly (she’s been told not to contact me and if officers of the court witness me feeling clearly threatened I can get a restraining order....). 

We agreed on a time, hung up, and I started entering into my phone and proceeded to run to the bathroom and be violently ill. I wasn’t expecting to have to be face to face with her so soon. MadameMorrible has not respect for me, continually asking SO if she can “just hear my voice, we don’t have to talk about money!”

I’m filled with a deep-seated level of fear, fear of her and fear of the unknown... and guilt at having to make my SO take another day of work, and, quite frankly... anger. 

Llamas, I dreamed about MadameMorrible, and my deceased father 2 nights ago. I told my father I knew it was a dream, that he wasn’t just sick, he had died a year ago, but we were going to keep the dream going because I was going to stick it to/show MadameMorrible. I woke up feeling like a giant asshole.

I know MadameMorrible dying would help nothing because then I’d have to deal with her estate, but can’t she just fuck off to a hole for a little while?

340,"Update: My JNMiL is living here now... (long post, drama llamas)",Mistress_Jedana,0,74,260,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1535981467.0,9clhi2,"Check BB for what's been going on, if you like.  A bit of drama, and I've been battling migraines all week long. Some family drama in here, but all relates to the MIL issue.

So, last week, we said my JNMiL could come and live with us.  She's been couch surfing for at least the last couple of years, going from grandchild to grandchild to cousins or siblings or their kids.

I posted on FB that she was coming, asked for any advice/help.  I also posted I was a bit frustrated, as she is not well and hasn't been taking care of herself, and I was going to end up being a caretaker yet again (as I was for DH during his 10 years of hell).  I also said that I think it's going to be a hard time for us for awhile, as neither side really knows the other (having only ever physically been around her less than the fingers on my hands).   I did not once call her any names, make any negative comments about her or her family; this post solely centered on my thoughts and feelings and what was coming.

I will point out here that the only people on my FB page are people I actually know;  like 50 people and most of that is family.  I don't even have all of my family on there, because I don't want to deal with their shit even online.  I thought I had blocked off all of DH's family (because I have zero use for their shit, even less than my own family) years ago, but I missed one of his nieces.

Well, his niece popped onto my post and started threatening me.  Then my dumbass sister (who can't keep her damn nose out of anything) started on her.   So...I blocked the niece and put my sister in FB timeout for 30 days.  The niece called her mommy (who is now officially bipolar, and having seizures, and lives with a random guy in his semi) and then they brought the drama to the rest of DH's family.  As they couldn't contact me (since none of them have my phone number and I blocked them on FB years ago), they contacted my fucking daughters on their FB.  DH's sister went as far as contacting my teenage son, telling him to have his dad call her because his 'bitch of a mom' is ignoring her.    Both my girls told them all to fuck right off and blocked them as well (and when his sister called my middle kid 'little J (my name)', she proudly posted on her FB page that she would like to be called 'little J' from here on out.  Hell, my sons-in-law both laughed at that shit, and said they can only hope their wives turn out like me.  /blush

DH and I had a very long talk when he got home, and he has ignored every attempt at his family to contact him since.  He said he doesn't need their drama, and he has my back.  He did tell his sister that if she ever pulled that shit again, he'd let me loose on her.  He also told her she didn't want to start shit with any of my kids, because they were trained by the best (he means me!) and would rip her dumb ass to shreds.    He earned his happy time that day, haha.

We showed up to where his mom has been staying on Saturday.  She didn't tell them that we were coming to get her, because she didn't think we were coming.  So, we got what stuff she had there (4 bags of clothes, that's all she has in the world) and brought her home.  She didn't even have a toothbrush.   She was sleeping a recliner in front of a tv in the living room...Eight people (5 adults, 3 kids), 3 bedroom house, 1 bathroom; one elderly adult in a wheelchair, one elderly adult barely able to walk, 2 grown adults who smoke constantly, a 19 year old adult/kid, a 10 year old kid and a 5 year old kid with Cystic Fibrosis, who is trying to get on the lung transplant list, plus MIL.  The kids all shared a room (yeah, 19 boy, 10 boy, 5 girl); the other two elderly share a room (they are MIL's siblings) and then the adults share a room.

Here, she has her own bedroom, a twin bed with a very good mattress (was DS's and is less than 4 months old; we upgraded him to a Full bed); she has my old 40"" tv w/cable box (DS was using it; we're buying him a new one for his birthday next month).   We bought her a flip phone (her choice, big number buttons) so she has her own phone line to call her family; I gave her my old Kindle, made her an email and a FB account so she can contact her family that way.   We are getting her a shower chair, and will put that in our bathroom (as we have a walk in shower, and it would be safer for her to shower in there than in other bathroom, which has a regular tub/shower set up).

DH calls her 'an emotional terrorist', and I see why.  She is so passive aggressive with her comments, and it's already driving us all nuts.  DH and I are presenting a united front (any disagreements will happen in the privacy of our bedroom or the car) and he has told his family to entirely fuck right off and to not contact him again.

He's taking her next Friday to open a bank account, as her SS checks get deposited to an account she shares with her daughter (so all her money has been being hijacked by that cunt); he'll be on the account with her, but we aren't touching a penny of it.  That's for her to use to get what she needs/wants or pay for medical stuff; we're covering living expenses and most food costs for her.    He's trying to figure out what she has for medical coverage, and what we need to get started for her; I don't think she even has her social security card or a picture id.   This is gonna suck.

When I hear people raising their voices, I instantly freeze and assume it's because of something I've done to make them angry. When someone touches me unexpectedly, I instantly flinch away, thinking they're going to hurt me (even though I was not physically abused when I was younger). When someone gets irritated with me, I instantly become so apologetic that it can be pathetic.

Does this ring any bells for you? Do you know how to managed these seemingly automatic responses to normal behaviours?

345,Haven't posted here before. Nice to see a Reddit community like this. Been having a hard time with NC and anger recently.,EmanResuFignewton,0,3,6,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536116002.0,9d2d76,"So for a little background, my NMom is a mess. She was abusive, neglectful, and manipulative my entire childhood... I moved in with my dad at 13 but the damage was already done. Was in and out of hospitals for mental health between 13 and 19. She was still a part of my life, and her proximity made it hard for me to see that most of not all of my issues have come from the way she treated me.

September 29th, 2016, she took off and ditched my father and I. She was living with us, strictly as a roommate. She got angry about the money she was paying toward bills, and took off in the middle of the day while my father and I were both out of the house. No warning. This was the third time in the last four years prior she pulled something like thay, and something in me just snapped. I cut her off completely. I was 21, almost 22.

I'm now almost 24. My mental health treatment is finally *helping* because I'm actually getting to the core of the issues since I'm no longer in her sphere of influence. I'm dating a wonderful man who plans to propose soon. Everything in my life is getting so much better. I have zero contact with anyone who would be able to give her any information whatsoever about me.

I don't want to reform a relationship with her. What I want is to rub it in her face how much better I've become. How quickly my life went uphill when I cut her off like a malignant tumor. I want to contact her just to say ""SEE! Look what I can do!"" I know this would be stupid, and I know I would never actually do it. But I am full of so much *anger* I don't know how to swallow it. I am almost 24 years old. I am an adult. But I want to throw everything in her face. I want to make a point by point list of her atrocities, and read it six inches from her face while she sobs, which she would because she is *always* the victim. I am so ANGRY and I just have no idea how to move past it. The sadness is gone, the desperation for the life I could have had if she was never in my life is fading. But the anger is still burning in me and it's so toxic, but I can't figure out how to take it away.

A few months before she took off, there was a moment where she was screaming about something or other, inches from my face, spitting poison. I just wanted her to shut the fuck up. I was just so done. I grabbed her forearm to push her away from me, something I have NEVER done before. But suddenly I couldn't let go. I felt my hand squeeze, but it felt like I wasn't controlling it. She saw it in my face, and she whipped her arm away. I've swear it's like an untapped rage appeared in that moment and hasn't gone away. That was the scariest moment of my life. She has always made me feel like a pathetic, scared little girl, who she could control with her bellowing screaming and in that moment I just snapped. I couldn't fucking stand it, I couldn't stand her screaming in my fucking face for one more second. I'm still grateful she pulled away, because I genuinely don't know what I would have ended up doing had she not. I was squeezing her arm hard, but I just wanted to break it in half.

I am so scared of the woman I was in that moment, but it still feels like she exists so much in me. That angry, broken person who wants to break my mother's face.

I just don't know how to make this anger go away.

This ended up being a long rant. Thank you if you ended up reading it."
346,My car accident and fall semester of senior year,drowninginhighlight,0,2,18,False,JUSTNOMIL,,1536079274.0,9cxcpd,"Not much recent updates on the QGR front. She’s actually been pretty tame/quiet. Actually not being unhelpful about the whole new job stressing me out thing. Still not telling her shit about the “bile/stomach bug” being a panic attack. Maybe once I’ve quit and found a new job. Anyways, I’m here to post about the time I totaled a car and how she treated me for the first six months after.

Now, I’m not here to play the victim or justify anything. I’ll give credit where it’s due, and I do commend QGR for at least not raising me to be a snowflake. As well as being one of those moms that would Bitch slap me inside out if I ever so much as rolled my eyes at her, or spoke to her like a ton of other kids spoke to their parents. But there has to be a line.

So summer 2015, I wanted to be a dentist, and was taking a summer class, while shadowing at a dentist’s office. This one particular day, I was shadowing, after a tumultuous all nighter studying for a test. Now, maybe I shouldn’t have been wearing wedges. Nor should I have used my phone at a red light. Long story short, I made an improper left and this resulted in a head on collision. A week before my 21st.

Initially, QGR and her consort were cool about it, and more relieved that me and the other guy weren’t massively injured. Just some bruises. And they didn’t really want me to regress and lose confidence driving, so they got a rental for a week. But alas, this isn’t a happy story.

The day of my 21st birthday, I had class. Shadowing in the morning, quick lunch, then off to school. Right before shadowing, QGR told me that I totaled the car to get attention on Facebook. Um. I didn’t post shit on Facebook or any social media platform. And if I wanted attention on social media so bad, I’d probably get a super expensive makeover and post some selfies. Not total a car.

Her consort was also joining in the fun too. They’d constantly be up my ass about being on my phone, and he had this new rule in place. All phones in the hall at night. Bitch I use that shit for alarms. The other actual alarm clocks don’t work for shit anymore. And he wanted to fucking walk from the enterprise office back home. Something I was scared to dispute because he often snapped at me about needing to exercise more. OF COURSE I TELL QGR THIS AND SHE SNITCHES AND GETS ME YELLED AT.

Around this time, I also found out that my “friends” couldn’t have given even a marble turd. This after constantly calling and texting about my accident. The mutual friend who informed me was supposed to be my best friend. And she was making excuses for her college crushes, that “they may not want to be friends but they want you to be happy with your other friends!” And “you have all these other friends idk why you think it’s embarrassing.” 

This was also around the time I got an iPhone and decided to share dad’s iCloud. YES I KNOW ROOKIE MISTAKE I DIDNT KNOW HOW IPHONE WORKS. So of course QGR snoops on my texts via his MacBook Pro. And throws them in my face, accusing me of sexual harassment (IT WAS MUTUAL FLIRTING. THANK GOD NO NUDES), and clearly knew about the friends thing. She belittled it indirectly. And called me emotionally unstable, along with a tirade of other things wrong with me. WHYYYYYY WONT YOU TALK TO MEEEEEEEEEE?!

Around the time the semester started, I was defeated. You llamas know the whole all science academic probation junk. This is just the prologue/behind the scenes. I had a new car after Labor Day, and was taking a defensive drivers course to get the two points off my license. But that semester was plagued by untreated depression.

At one point early on, she wanted to take me to a yoga therapist. She wanted to “get to the root of the problem,” and the school counseling center was taking advantage of me (PLEASE ENLIGHTEN ME). She then screams that I’m close-minded. Nah, I just don’t want to do yoga and meditation because you were up my ass about it. So we go to the yoga therapist, and I still hate her for reasons I’m going to detail in this next paragraph.

I told that bitch I didn’t appreciate QGR ending my high school relationship (I’m actually over it now, not sure if I’ll ever make a post about it), because two horny teens were sexting. And how she caused my ex bf to be bitter at me. SHE TOLD QGR. I didn’t find this out till finals, when I spent all night up studying and making a cheat sheet (sanctioned for the exam), and she screamed at me about it when I tiredly told her I guess we’d find out how the final went.

I didn’t know HOW QGR knew until we saw a psychiatrist and she simpered to her about it, and then admitted that she may have spoken to his parents. Or implied it. I know, it’s been 9 years at this point. But it was the principle of the matter. I’m a firm believer that people should fuck up their own relationships. 

It was also around finals week that she was snapping at me for running my mouth and apparently telling people she ruined my life. I mean. I didn’t use those words but sure whatever you wanna believe. She then proceeds to justify her marriage (tainted by her own JNMIL), saying that at least he was only an alcoholic and she stayed because her parents wouldn’t “let” her divorce, and he said he loves his wife and kids. Lol.

That’s pretty much it. At this point, maybe I’ll be posting some stories about my childhood. Not sure how many of those there are, but you llamas will get the scoop as more recent stuff goes down! "

348,NFriend won't get out of my life!,palaverhound,0,5,7,False,raisedbynarcissists,,1536118841.0,9d2pwi,"Just a quick trigger warning: This post deals with some aspects of suicide and rape, neither of which in great detail.  I would have posted this in the regular r/narccissists forum but for some reason, I'm not able to. 

This is long. Anyone who reads this is a god damned champion. For everyone else. 




TL;DR : N friend had issues with her life and health, but as soon as I had problems with my heart, I was a liar. She would ""LOVE me no matter how much I lied.""  She used me to be a martyr. Now Nparents might shack with Nfriend.



I should be working right now. I have so much to get done for clients, and I've wasted my whole day, stressing, being angry, and bitter about this girl who won't leave me alone. But I need to get it out. I need SOMEONE to know.
 Hai. I'm Palaver, and I had a narcissistic friend.  

In this story, we are going to call her Annie. 

I grew up with Nparents, and by the time I realized, it was already a little too late for my sanity. I snapped, packed my bags, and ran away to my boyfriend's house, who's parents, lovingly brought me into their home.  This was ten years ago. Back track seven years, and I will have met Annie at a friend's party. She told me the story about how she came from South Carolina, had been homeless, on drugs, but was now clean, and moving back in with her mom, to help her mom take care of her home. From what I was told, her mom had health problems. (Mainly IBS, but she told me a list of other things that I can't remember now.) Annie is....a little slow to say the least. Common sense ain't common for her, but she was a GENUINELY nice person. Really really fun, happy, bubbly to be around. I figured. Hell. Let's hang out more.

We did, and for seven years our relationship was pretty good for the most part. She was unrealistic as to what her strengths and weaknesses were, ( she considers herself a musician/poet/artist, none of which she does well.)  but I supported her regardless.  I was told all kinds of crazy stories. One of which was when she tried committing suicide by jumping off a short bridge; but before doing so, she tied a red scarf around the railing. So people knew. And would remember the pain that they caused her. Obviously she lived, but I wonder if her brain got a little scrambled. She told me how she didn't remember certain people or events, or how they knew her. She told me about how she had done mean things to people, and now she was trying to make amends with everyone. So apparently, this jump gave her a personality skip as well. 

In her presence, I DID notice that people kinda treated her like shit. She would often send me messages of screen caps of the shitty things people said to her. I was kind of floored at the animosity she was being shown, and more often than not, it was often a jealous wife, or a husband claiming that she needed to leave him alone. I repeatedly told her that she needed to pick a better clan of people to hang out with. That maybe she judged people poorly; but her response was that she could see the good in everyone, and that they always deserve a second chance.  Being her friend, I did my best to give the best advice I could but it did little to stymie her personal drama. 

At one point her mom kicked her out of the house, and told Annie that she didn't need her around to take care of her. Annie broke down telling me that her mom let her be raped, by letting her live with this nasty older ex husband when she was a kid, and that no one believed her. And since it seemed like THE WHOLE town knew about her, and hated her guts (the first obvious sign that completely went over my head.) I figured hey. I live with my boyfriend and his family. Maybe they can help.

Bf's family are kind caring, progressive christian people. They own a farm and there's always a need for an extra pair of hands. I was on my way out of the business at that time; found a school in the state that I'm living in now to pursue my career. Both of us were working hard to get our lives on track, so I figured we could help each other. I was going to need an apartment. She needed her GED, a license, money and a place to stay during that time before she left the state. So with the approval of BF's family, I got her a job, a place to live, helped her study for her GED and let her drive my car to practice, before I ultimately left. The plan was she would join us when she had everything fulfilled that she wanted to have fulfilled. 

Now, this girl never really had a job before. She would do odd ball cleaning for people, and then apparently get fucked over; but she couldn't get a REAL job, because she was on SSI and didn't want the extra money from taxes to interfere with her benefits. BF's father paid her under the table to remedy that issue. Everything seemed fine. She was well on her way. I moved. 

That's when the phone calls started. They were always at 8, 9, 10 pm, and I was usually getting on to the train from school to go home. She would be teary, and crying. Her health was bad. Her feet hurt so badly. Her digestion was fuckie. She had a lump in her armpit. She was vomiting all the time. She just had THINGS wrong with her. She went to the hospital several times for pain that was undiagnosed, as far as I know. She had people drive her to the ER several times in the middle of the night. (Granted it's a farm so we all got up at like. 6am?) The biggest thing that she refused to get help with was her mental health, to which she claimed she was not mentally unwell, but I'm pretty sure she's borderline. Flips on a switch type of thing. I'd seen her do these things before, but she had never played them out on me. I was her BEST friend. Her only friend at the time probably. 

She couldn't work at the farm, it was too hard. BF parents were ""keeping her from getting her education."" This made no sense to me because they had gladly said goodbye to me, when i told them I was going to school out of state. BUT. BF parents are old school in some aspects, so I wondered if BF's dad was being hard on her. These conversations would end with me telling her it was going to be okay. That we just had to get things in order. That she could do this. This was the easy part. She'd be hopeful by the end of the conversation (You're the best Palaver, you're such a good friend, yadda yadda.) and we would end it. Until she would call three-four days later. Same stories. MORE stories.

The family had betrayed her. There was a tenant that stole her stuff. No one would listen. She wanted to lock her door, but BF dad, said no, we don't lock doors in this house. She complained about how much rent she was being charged, which I couldn't stand to listen to because it was 200.00 as opposed to the 850 that I was paying as a family member. But after rent, she had NO money left because of health/medical bills. This all upset me, and made me feel bad. I didn't realize that the environment was going to be so rough for her. it was never my intention of just ""leaving"" her there, but she didn't want to move from out of the state until she had a, b and c checked off from her life list goals. 

Still with me? I appreciate it. 

I worked harder to try and get her to this state before she completely blew a gasket. It was partially my fear that the family would hate me for inviting her idiocy into the home. It was also my fear that Annie would feel abandoned. The calls continued. 

One christmas ago I went and visited the farm. She was still living there at that point, and was getting into a not-so-serious relationship with a boy from a near by farm. She told me that she thought that he was ""stupid and slow."" To which I thought, pot calling the kettle black, but everyone has their threshold of stupidity that they can handle. All I saw however, was that this boy, (Let's call him Brian.) was nothing but a gentleman to her. Drove her to the ER when she needed it, worked her shifts when she was too sick. Made her food, waited on her hand and foot. She wasn't ""interested"" in him and she had told Brian that she was moving out of state with me at some point so don't get attached. Brian agreed that it was important for her to get a higher education. Funny enough, about a month later Brian got some kind of cancerous tumor in his arm. And all of a sudden, she couldn't LEAVE him.  She HAD to help him through his treatments, and that she would join us after he was better. They were going to get married. He was going through chemo and all this other stuff. I DID confirm that at least part of this story was true, but her flip into needing to be a white knight kind of irritated me. But I've never, to this day told her that. 

After all her health problems she comes up to me one day and I'm severely stressing out because I have a heart problem, that's undiagnosed and my heart is beating too slow. (Somewhere between 45-40 BPM) I hadn't told Annie because she was dealing with her own shit. Granted I don't tell most people in my life what's going on except for my BF, but she sussed it out of me, and I told her. She offered very little comfort and immediately started telling me about her mom, and her mom's heart problems. I waved it off, and was like, okay thanks. I didn't think anything about it, and she didn't seem deterred. She even gave me a bunch of phony diagnosis because her mom is a registered nurse. 

Back track now, 6 months ago, a mutual friend of me and my BF went suddenly ill into a diabetic coma, and we thought she was going to die. So we ended up back in the state. During the off time that I wasn't at the hospital, I tried to make some kind of plans to hang out with Annie, since I WAS around and everything. At this point, not-so-serious boyfriend had her living with him in his little shack outside of town because the farm environment was just too hard for her. She had also poisoned him with lies about my BF's family and so he quit as well. We hung out one night together, all three of us, and it seemed fine. Did what we usually did, which was basically shooting the shit and chain-smoking cigarettes.  The next morning, I got messages on my cell from her VIA facebook. She went on and on about how if I was in the hospital she would come and visit me. (Trim my toenails apparently was one of the things she had in mind.) Frankly she's so loud and annoying most times that I told her, I really wouldn't want anyone there but my close family and my bf. We had a big conversation about how she would fight security; stupid conversation you know?  And then the comment, that ticked me off and started everything:

Annie: Well you're broke and your parents don't have money either, someone would have to pay those bills. 

One, I wasn't broke. Two, for some reason, her just telling me that I can't handle my own bills, while she's apparently floundering with her bills AND can't seem to save up for an apartment, kind of made me blow my lid. After she insisted that she would work her ass off for me, I responded that I had a support network and that I could handle those things on my own. Call it a matter of pride I suppose. She then goes to tell me:

You're a dick sometimes.  
Like I'm used to a lot of the stuff you say. You lie sometimes and I just pat it away. My love for you is unconditional because I see your worth as a person, and honestly everyone needs a friend who would go through that amount of trouble to have you around
Nothing you do or say will keep away my loyality. If you push I will be at a distance but with a hopeful spirit.
Simply Palaver,  you're important. Not just to me. But what you do has its affects and I enjoy seeing them

I asked her what I lied about and her response floored me. Here's a small portion of our conversation that I archived, in the event she ever wanted to come back at me with twisted lies.

Annie:  You lie or over exaggerate details. You've done it a lot throughout our friendship. Sometimes I ask why you do it when I've been nothing but honest with you. But I accept it because sometimes its just what you believe or think in the moment and they may not be lies but venting and scenario building. Like a month ago you said you were diagnosed with a heart condition which for years you said you had one. But your ma said you didn't. I didn't care much for what she said but then suddenly youre undiagnosed? And you don't know what's wrong?   Its a small detail but you're important to me so it matters to know what's really going on 

Me:  But know you embellish your own stories. It's a give and take relationship. I don't outright lie. I suspected I had a heart problem. Now I'm being diagnosed. I had no way of actually knowing. I dont know what's wrong, and neither does my cardiologist right now.

Annie:  Why would you tell me you were diagnosed with a heart condition when you still don't know

Me:  
Because I am. I have a condition that causes my heart to beat irregularly, but they don't know why it does. I feel like sometimes you can jump to conclusions without asking the right questions. I have no reason to lie about that
Lol like why?
I was telling you because I was stressed and going through the testing


The convo goes on and on with more petty bullshit, her response to this was,"" well I don't believe you, and I talked to your mom and she doesn't remember you having a heart problem at all.""  That I lied about that, that I lied about dropping out of school. Then it was; you don't know what suffering is. You've always had BF's family since you were a little girl. I've always been on my own, and homeless. No one helps me. No one supports me. Generic solutions aren't going to fix my problems. I'm not like other people. Your advice is useless for someone who has nothing.  It's like telling African children to grow a garden without seeds.  I slept in drug houses and under bridges. I did whatever I could to just survive. Palaver, as much as you want to believe we are similar. Our history is not.""

I got sick of her pity cries at this point. Called her out for wallowing in it. At this point, she must NOT have wanted me to be able to save any part of the convo, because she started talking to me through voice recordings. They're mostly incomprehensible saying me, me, me, life is too hard.  Put yourself in my shoes. Even though when I tried, I could never compare to her painful existence. 

Pain poker. It had literally become a game of pain poker. And I realized; this is what she did to other people, but now she has her boyfriend. She had Brian. And because she had Brian, there was a safety net for her to create drama. I was no longer safe from her. The kicker to the conversation was when she told me no matter what I did she would always love me and be loyal. Even from afar. Essentially, I tell lies, and she's the martyr who's a good person no matter what. I told her I didn't want to be that kind of friend for her. That if that was how she viewed our relationship, that I had, essentially, become a toxic friend to her, enabling her delusions. She got upset about this, and blocked me on facebook, after getting the last word.

I'm not one for petty blocks and unblocks. I just don't play with that shit. She decided to cut the tie right then and there by throwing a tantrum and blocking me. So I said fine. I blocked her back. I blocked her number. I blocked every aspect of her from my life. She sent her BF Brian after me to tell me that I was mean, and that I hurt her feelings. That ""I need to talk to her now.""  I said. Okay. Then I blocked him too. 

Obviously because the situation wasn't resolved for her,  she's made her rounds calling my family, trying to worm her way in any way she can.

She messages BF parents telling them that 'she misses the farm and that she loves everyone."" She called my Aunt Sally's cell phone (somehow she got the number?) asking how Grandma was, and that she would like to take them out to eat. Aunt Sally knows this girl's crazy, and tried to explain that she understood that me and Annie had a falling out, to which Annie promptly responded, ""Well it's more Palaver's fault than mine."" 

Her recent stunt has included talking to my mom on facebook. I'm still in contact with both Nparents, though at a distance, and I limit my phone conversations with them before I get hostile.  My nparents, who are pretty brain dead, are in the process of being homeless. Now I'm in no financial or homing situation where I can help them get back on their feet, so even if I wanted to I can't.  My mom had posted something on facebook along the lines of, ""we might be homeless, if such and such doesn't play out well."" Annie messaged my mom, who then in turn showed me screen caps of what was sent. Basically along the lines of:

Here's my contact information. I know Palaver can't help you, and because I couldn't move out of the state like I planned, I was homeless for a while so I know how that goes. I completely understand I'm always here for you."" 

This would be my greatest nightmare come true if Nparents ended up shacking with Nfriend. I told my mom not to take her up on her offer, and she responded by telling me ""Well I'm not going to burn any bridges."" I immediately flipped my shit and told Nmom (who's emotional manipulation I learned from her no doubt) that if she did take Annie up on her offer that I wouldn't be able to talk to her anymore.  This was just one more power play. One more way for Nfriend to try and get under my skin and into my life. One more way for Annie to tell everyone what a GOOD person she is.  I didn't tell my mom that I would cut her out of my life to be manipulative; but for my own emotional health and sanity, I just couldn't allow it to enter my life. That and I obviously want to help my parents, so it make me look like a shit person. Also a quick check with nmom has confirmed that Annie NEVER spoke to her about my health problems. 

Not to mention my fake heart condition has me pretty ill today. I'm pretty sure my irregular heart rates are because of my lack of stress management, and this today, has certainly proved that. 

I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to ever get this girl out of my life. I just want it to end. I feel stupid for ever trying to help her to begin with. I've taken the higher road as much as possible and I haven't communicated with her on any level since blocking her from my life. I know she's poking. She's poking to get a reaction. She does this until people snap and say horrible horrible things about her.  She brings the worst out in people. 

I'm pretty sure she might actually be a demon. "
